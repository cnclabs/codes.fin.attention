table of contents glossary of terms note the definitions of proven and probable mineral reserves and the definitions for measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources set forth below are those used in canada as required in accordance with national instrument the definitions of proven and probable mineral reserves are consistent with those prescribed for use in the us by the securities and exchange commission and set forth in sec industry guide mineral reserve the term mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
a mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven mineral reserve the term proven mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
probable mineral reserve the term probable mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of an indicated  and in some circumstances a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
mineral resource also referred to as non reserves the term mineral resource refers to a concentration or occurrence of natural  solid  inorganic or fossilized organic material in or on the earth s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
the location  quantity  grade  geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known  estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge 
measured mineral resource the term measured mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape  physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration  sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity 
indicated mineral resource the term indicated mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics  can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed 

table of contents inferred mineral resource the term inferred mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed  but not verified  geological and grade continuity 
the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes 
qualified person the term qualified person refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration  mine development  production activities and project assessment  or any combination thereof  including experience relevant to the subject matter of the project or report and is a member in good standing of a self regulating organization 
we use the following definitions of the stages of the exploration and development process 
there can be no assurance that the terminology used by us is consistent with the terminology used by other companies in the mining industry or by industry analysts 
exploration stage an exploration stage prospect typically involves testing one or more targets within an area which have been determined to have merit  first with a combination of geological  geochemical and geophysical analysis  and then  once better defined targets have been established  by testing at depth  typically by trenching and drilling  and generating the information necessary to develop a three dimensional geologic model of the mineralized zone  which could be used to demonstrate mineralized materials and or mineral reserves 
feasibility stage during the feasibility stage  exploration continues to further increase confidence in mineralization while attempting to further expand the mineralization 
during this stage  management develops in detail the necessary engineering and costing for mining  processing  power and infrastructure  as well as the designs for the plant and equipment required to construct and operate a modern mining operation 
it is at the end of this stage that mineralization could be categorized as proven and or probable mineral reserves if a positive mining decision is justified 
the feasibility stage normally incorporates several phases of work  which involve increasing levels of detail including i scoping study  ii pre feasibility study  and iii bankable feasibility study 
development stage after the feasibility stage  a company could decide to bring the property into production 
the process of bringing a mine from the feasibility stage to the production stage is the development stage 
it is during this stage that costs are capitalized for us financial reporting purposes 
construction activities carried out during the development stage include shaft sinking  crosscutting  drifting and raising  stripping  processing plant construction  leach pad construction  tailings impoundment and infrastructure construction roads  power  water  ports  etc mining mining is the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product 
exploration continues during the mining process and  in many cases  mineral reserves are expanded during the life of the mine operations as the exploration potential of the deposit is realized 
alteration any change in the mineral composition of a rock brought about by physical or chemical means bio oxidation or biox a processing method that uses bacteria to oxidize refractory sulfide ore to make it amenable to normal oxide ore processing techniques such as carbon in leach birimian a thick and extensive sequence of proterozoic age metamorphosed sediments and volcanics first identified in the birim region of southern ghana cash operating cost per ounce is equal to total cash cost per ounce less royalties and production taxes divided by ounces sold during the period

we are a canadian international gold mining and exploration company producing gold in ghana  west africa 
our principal office is located at west toller drive  suite  littleton  colorado  and the registered and records office is located at th floor  west georgia street  vancouver  british columbia  canada vc h our fiscal year ends on december through our subsidiaries and joint ventures we own a controlling interest in four significant gold properties in southern ghana the bogoso property bogoso  the prestea property prestea  the wassa property wassa and the prestea underground property prestea underground 
bogoso and prestea are adjoining properties  operating as a single operation and referred to as bogoso prestea 
bogoso prestea and the prestea underground are owned by our owned subsidiary bogoso gold limited bgl 
in bogoso prestea sold  ounces of gold for an average gold price and cash operating cost of approximately and per ounce  respectively 
bogoso prestea has produced all of our gold since initiating production in late we hold a equity interest in wexford goldfields limited wgl  which owns the wassa gold property  located some kilometers east of bogoso prestea 
wassa is currently in development  and we expect gold production to commence in early the prestea underground is located on the prestea property and consists of a currently inactive underground gold mine and associated support facilities 
as of december  bgl owned an approximately operating interest in this mine and we are currently seeking to determine if the underground mine can be reactivated on a profitable basis 
we also hold interests in gold exploration properties in ghana  sierra leone  mali  suriname  and french guiana 
the french guiana properties are mainly held through our owned subsidiary  guyanor ressources sa guyanor 
we hold a royalty right on the gross rosebel gold mine in suriname and expect to begin receiving cash royalties from this property during most of our senior corporate management reside in littleton  colorado where we maintain our corporate headquarters 
in addition to the bogoso prestea and wassa employees  we have a small administrative office and staff in accra  the capital of ghana  and a small staff in french guiana where most of our south american exploration properties are located 
our accounting records are kept in compliance with canadian gaap and all of our operations  except for the french guiana office  transact business in us dollars and keep financial records in us dollars 
gold sales and production ghana has been a significant gold producing country for the last years with ashanti goldfields company limited s obuasi mine and the underground mine at prestea historically being the two major producers 
several other areas in ghana have also produced significant amounts of gold 
the gold industry in ghana is currently experiencing resurgence in exploration  development spending and gold production 
several large international gold mining companies have announced in the past year plans to spend several hundred million dollars on exploration and expansion projects in ghana 
gold production in ghana exceeded million ounces in each year from through  reaching approximately million ounces in gold production in ghana is projected to rise in the future as the planned developments and expansions reach the production stage 
all of our gold is sent to a south african gold refinery in the form of dor bars which average approximately gold with the remaining portion being primarily silver which we account for as a by product 
our gold is sold to a 
table of contents european bank and revenue is recognized when title is transferred to the customer at the accra international airport in ghana 
the sales price is based on the london pm fix on the day of delivery 
gold price history the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world

table of contents the following diagram depicts the organizational structure of golden star and our significant subsidiaries flowchart business strategy and development our business and development strategy since has been to focus primarily on the acquisition of producing and development stage gold properties in ghana and on the exploration  development and operation of these properties 
given our significant mineral resource position  we are currently carrying out technical studies to expand our production at bogoso prestea 
at our wassa property  we commenced development in mid  and now expect to commence production in early by processing material from the existing heap leach pads left by the former owner 
we plan to commence ore production from the wassa open pit mine in early if the above mentioned expansion and development plans are approved and permitted as expected  our annualized production should exceed  ounces of gold 
however  there can be no assurance that development and start up can be completed as anticipated or that our production goals will be achieved 
our objective is to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer which we understand to be a producer with annual production of approximately  ounces over the next few years 
due to higher gold prices and our improved financial condition  we believe we are well placed to pursue the acquisition of producing  development and advanced stage exploration gold properties and companies  primarily in ghana and elsewhere in africa 
we are actively investigating potential acquisition and merger candidates  some of which have indicated to potential acquirers or their advisors that they or certain of their properties might be available for acquisition 
however  we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any potential transaction 
we have increased exploration activities and expenditures on our current exploration properties  primarily in ghana 
our assets bogoso prestea as mentioned above  we own and operate the bogoso prestea gold mine in ghana  west africa 
ore is currently mined from an open pit surface operation at prestea and trucked approximately kilometers from the prestea mine site to the nominal  tonne per day bogoso processing plant where the ore is processed 
the bogoso processing plant utilizes cil technology along with gravity and flotation processes to separate gold from the ore 
cil technology is well known and is widely used for treating gold ores 
in addition to the mine and processing plant facility  our assets include a fleet of mining equipment  numerous ancillary facilities including warehouses  maintenance shops  roadways and administrative offices 
we also own several housing complexes at bogoso which include a medical center  cafeteria  store  recreation facility and golf course 
under normal operating conditions and current processing capacity  bogoso prestea would produce approximately  to  ounces per year  however in we sold  ounces due primarily to higher than average ore grades and improved recoveries 
historical and forecast production from bogoso prestea are shown on the gold production and cash costs table below 
wassa once wassa s development and construction are completed in  it will be very similar to bogoso prestea including an open pit surface mine  a cil processing plant  mining equipment and a town site with associated facilities 
prestea underground the prestea underground is located directly beneath the prestea property 
it is a large underground gold mine that operated for over years producing a total of approximately nine million ounces of gold prior to its closure in early we have entered into a joint venture with the previous owner and are now performing engineering  geological and economic analysis of the mine to determine if it can be reopened on a profitable basis 
the mine includes two useable shafts and several kilometers of underground workings on numerous levels extending as deep as  meters below the surface 
other assets we hold or have an interest in numerous exploration properties in ghana  sierra leone  mali  and south america 
most of the exploration properties in ghana are within trucking distance of bogoso prestea or wassa 
the mampon property  located approximately kilometers north of the bogoso processing plant  has 
table of contents mineral reserves of approximately million ounces which are expected to be trucked to the bogoso processing plant after we have a staff of geologists in ghana that are actively investigating the mineral resource potential of the various exploration properties  and we anticipate that such exploration effort will increase in gold production and cash costs the following table represents historical gold production and projected production for production and cash cost per ounce projected bogoso prestea ounces thousands cash operating cost oz total cash cost oz wassa ounces thousands cash operating cost oz total cash cost oz total ounces thousands consolidated cash operating cost oz consolidated total cash cost oz the projection for bogoso prestea excludes any impact from the planned installation of the bondaye processing plant at prestea  which subject to approvals and permitting  is expected to be completed by early wassa is expected to begin production by reprocessing materials  left on heap leach pads by a former owner  in early  subject to the timely receipt of the necessary operating permits and the commissioning of the cil processing plant which are progressing on schedule 
gold production is shown on a basis  which represents our current beneficial interest in gold production and revenues 
once all capital has been repaid  the government of ghana would receive of the dividends from the subsidiaries owning the bogoso prestea and wassa mines

exploration we spent approximately million in exploration activities during including million at wassa establishing mineral reserves in the existing pits and in areas outside the pits  million at the prestea underground  including underground care and maintenance costs  million on exploration projects outside the wassa and bogoso prestea areas and million developing new mineral reserves in the plant north area 
exploration spending during was less than expected due to a shortage of drill rigs in ghana 
recent increases in exploration activity in ghana by us and our competitors have adversely impacted drill rig availability and as a result some of our planned work was delayed  including drilling at the prestea underground which was delayed several months 
most of our exploration efforts in were focused on ghana  with prestea underground  prestea  wassa and the akropong trend properties receiving the most attention 
late in we began to explore the newly acquired dunkwa properties north of bogoso 
during we plan to spend approximately million on gold exploration 
approximately million will be used to evaluate surface projects in and around bogoso prestea including the akropong trend and dunkwa properties 
approximately million is planned for the continued exploration efforts at the prestea underground project  million is scheduled for the wassa area  million is expected to be spent on the properties in sierra leone and mali  both in west africa  million is expected to be used to identify and evaluate projects in south america  including some of guyanor s holdings  and million is planned for our project generation program 
we entered  subject to definitive documentation and government approval  into a joint venture agreement in late to invest up to million over the next four years in the mano river project in sierra leone via an earn in agreement with a junior exploration company which now holds a group of gold exploration properties in sierra leone 
the initial million  if fully funded we can terminate the joint venture agreement after spending million  would yield a interest in the joint venture 
further provisions of the joint venture agreement provide the opportunity to acquire up to of the joint venture by continued long term funding 
spending was nil in in late we entered into a second joint venture agreement  subject to definitive documentation and government approval  agreeing to fund exploration work on the mininko gold property in mali 
funding of million would 
table of contents earn a interest in the joint venture 
we can terminate the joint venture agreement after spending million  of which million was spent in the joint venture agreement provides that we can earn up to an interest by continued funding of exploration and development 
we also provided million of funding during to a junior exploration company working in south america 
the guyanor properties were maintained on a care and maintenance basis during  but we expect to initiate new exploration efforts there in focusing on further evaluation of our existing properties and recently acquired properties 
we do not believe it to be cost effective at this point to add exploration staff or to establish additional exploration offices 
as such  we expect to utilize funding of joint ventures for much of our exploration activities outside the bogoso prestea area where our current exploration staff resides 
employee relations as of december  golden star  including our majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures  had approximately  employees and contract employees  a decrease from the approximately  people employed at the end of the total includes ten employees and four part time or contract employees at our principal office in littleton  colorado 
customers all of our gold is sold to a single european bank in accordance with a long term contract whereby cash payment for gold sold is received in our account two to three working days after each shipment with title passing at the point of shipment at the accra international airport 
the global gold market is competitive with numerous banks and refineries willing to buy gold on short notice  therefore we believe that the loss of our current customer would not materially delay or disrupt revenues 
competition we compete with major mining companies and other natural mineral resource companies in the acquisition  exploration  financing and development of new prospects 
many of these companies are larger and better capitalized than we are 
there is significant competition for the limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities 
our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically explore  acquire and develop new and existing mineral prospects 
factors that allow producers to remain competitive in the market over the long term include the quality and size of their orebodies  costs of operation  and the acquisition and retention of qualified employees 
we also compete with other mining companies for skilled mining engineers  mine and processing plant operators and mechanics  geologists  geophysicists and other technical personnel 
this could result in higher turnover and greater labor costs

table of contents risk factors you should consider carefully the following discussion of risks  in addition to the other information contained in  or incorporated by reference into  this report 
financial risks our business is substantially dependent on gold prices 
the price of our common shares  our financial results and our exploration  development and mining activities have previously been  and would in the future be  significantly adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of gold 
the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world 
if gold prices were to decline significantly or for an extended period of time  we might be unable to continue our operations  develop our properties or fulfill our obligations under our agreements with our partners or under our permits and licenses 
as a result  we could lose our interest in  or be forced to sell  some of our properties 
furthermore  mineral reserve calculations and life of mine plans using significantly lower gold prices could result in reduced estimates of mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources and in material write downs of our investment in mining properties and increased amortization  reclamation and closure charges 
we have recorded substantial losses in the past 
while we had earnings of million and million in and  respectively  we reported net losses of million in  million in  and million in numerous factors  including declining gold prices  lower than expected ore grades or higher than expected operating costs  and impairment write offs of mine property and or exploration property costs  could cause us to become unprofitable in the future 
any future operating losses could make financing our operations and our business strategy  or raising additional capital  difficult or impossible and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
our obligations could strain our financial position and impede our business strategy 
we have total debts and liabilities as of december  of million  including million payable to financial institutions  million of current trade payables and accrued current liabilities and million in environmental rehabilitation liabilities 
we expect that our indebtedness and other liabilities will increase as a result of our corporate development activities 
this indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  operating and exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  which would reduce our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures  operating and exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt relative to their market capitalization 
our estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves could be inaccurate 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable mineral reserves and measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources  including many factors beyond our control 
the estimation of mineral reserves and non reserves is a subjective process  and the accuracy of any such estimates are a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and 
table of contents geological interpretation  which could prove to be unreliable 
there can be no assurance that these estimates will be accurate  that mineral reserves and non reserves figures will be accurate  or that mineral reserves or non reserves could be mined or processed profitably 
fluctuation in gold prices  results of drilling  metallurgical testing and production and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate could require revision of the estimate 
the volume and grade of mineral reserves mined and processed and recovery rates might not be the same as currently anticipated 
any material reductions in estimates of our mineral reserves and non reserves  or of our ability to extract these mineral reserves and non reserves  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have only one source of operational cash flows 
while we have recently received significant infusions of cash from sales of equity  our only internal source of funds is operational cash flows from bogoso prestea 
we expect to commence production at wassa in early  although there can be no assurance that our wassa production goals will be achieved 
the anticipated continuing exploration and development of our properties will require significant expenditures over the next several years 
we expect that these expenditures will exceed free cash flows generated by bogoso prestea during that period  and therefore we expect to use our excess cash and in the future to require additional outside capital 
lower gold prices during the five years prior to adversely affected our ability to obtain financing  and recurring lower gold prices could have similar effects in the future 
we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we might need to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development of our properties  and as a result  we could lose our interest in  or could be forced to sell  some of our properties 
implementation of a hedging program might be unsuccessful and incur losses 
we continue to review whether or not  in light of the potential for gold prices to fall  it would be appropriate to establish a hedging program 
to date  we have not decided to implement a hedging program  although we have purchased and expect to continue to purchase puts from time to time  which give us the right to sell gold in the future at a fixed price 
the implementation of a hedging program might not  however  protect adequately against declines in the price of gold 
in addition  although a hedging program could protect us from a decline in the price of gold  it might also prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases 
for example  as part of a hedging program  we could be obligated to sell gold at a price lower than the then current market price 
finally  if unsuccessful  the costs of any hedging program could further deplete our financial resources 
we are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could materially adversely affect our financial position 
our revenues are in us dollars  and we maintain most of our working capital in us dollars or us dollar denominated securities 
we convert funds to foreign currencies as payment obligations become due 
a significant portion of the operating costs at bogoso prestea is based on the ghanaian currency  the cedi 
we are required to convert into cedis only of the foreign exchange proceeds that we receive from selling gold  but the government of ghana could require us to convert a higher percentage of such sales proceeds into cedis in the future 
in addition  we currently have future obligations that are payable in euros  and receivables collectible in euros 
we obtain construction and other services and materials and supplies from providers in south africa and other countries  and the costs of those services could increase due to changes in the value of the south african rand or other currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the us dollar and these currencies  and such fluctuations could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
consequently  construction  development and other costs might be higher than we anticipate 
we currently do not hedge against currency exchange risks  although we might do so from time to time in the future 
there can be no assurance that implementation of a currency hedging program would adequately protect us from the effects of fluctuation in currency exchange rates 
there could be no opportunity to evaluate the merits or risks of any future acquisition undertaken by us 

table of contents as a key element of our growth strategy  we have stepped up the active pursuit of acquisitions of producing  development and advanced stage exploration properties and companies 
we are actively investigating potential acquisition and merger candidates 
risks related to acquiring and operating acquired properties and companies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  to acquire properties and companies  we would use our available cash  incur debt  issue our common shares or other securities  or a combination of any one or more of these 
this could limit our flexibility to raise capital  to operate  explore and develop our properties and to make additional acquisitions  and could further dilute and decrease the trading price of our common shares 
acquisition transactions in our business are often initiated and completed over a particularly short period of time 
there could be no opportunity for our shareholders to evaluate the merits or risks of any future acquisition undertaken by us except as required by applicable laws and regulations 
risks inherent in acquisitions that we might undertake could adversely affect our growth and financial condition 
we are actively pursuing the acquisition of producing  development and advanced stage exploration properties and companies  and have recently completed the acquisition of exploration and development properties in ghana 
from time to time  we might acquire securities of or other interests in companies with which we could enter into acquisitions or other transactions 
acquisition transactions involve inherent risks  including accurately assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  ability to achieve identified and anticipated operating and financial synergies  unanticipated costs  diversion of management attention from existing business  potential loss of our key employees or the key employees of any business we acquire  unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition  and decline in the value of acquired properties  companies or securities 
any one or more of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of properties or companies  and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and on our financial condition 
we are subject to litigation risks 
all industries  including the mining industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit 
we are involved in various routine legal proceedings  which include labor matters such as unfair termination claims  supplier matters and property issues incidental to our business 
we believe it is unlikely that the final outcome of these legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation 
however  defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular legal proceeding will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
operational risks the technology  capital costs and cost of production of refractory mineral reserves and non reserves at bogoso prestea remain subject to a number of uncertainties  including funding uncertainties 
based upon the completion of our bogoso sulfide project feasibility study in and its subsequent review by a qualified person under canada s national instrument  the refractory material at bogoso prestea has been included in our proven and probable mineral reserves 
while the sulfide project feasibility study indicated that refractory mineral reserves can be profitably mined and processed at gold prices at or above per ounce  the capital cost to upgrade the bogoso processing plant with a bio oxidation or biox circuit to process refractory ore  together with related mining equipment  and facilities  is significant 
the capital cost of the sulfide project together with our other bogoso prestea expansion plans including capitalized exploration  mine development  and expanding the mining fleet is expected to be approximately million expected to be spent in and we cannot assure you that we will have access to capital  whether from internal or external sources  in the required amounts or on acceptable terms 
while the processing technology envisioned in the feasibility study has been successfully utilized at other mines  we cannot 
table of contents assure you  in spite of our testing  engineering and analysis  that the technology will perform successfully at commercial production levels on the bogoso prestea refractory sulfide ores 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our production estimates can be achieved 
completion of development of wassa and the projected expansion of bogoso prestea is subject to a number of uncertainties 
we have completed a feasibility study regarding the development of and commencement of production at wassa in ghana using conventional cil processing techniques and have commenced development of the wassa mine 
we cannot assure you that production will commence when we currently anticipate 
we have not yet completed technical studies for the projected million expansion of bogoso prestea 
the management of mine development projects and start up of new operations are complex 
we do not have a history of managing simultaneously two significant development projects and an ongoing operation 
we cannot assure you that these development projects will be completed at the cost and on the schedule predicted  or that gold grades and recoveries  production rates or costs anticipated will be achieved 
any development of wassa and expansion of bogoso prestea are subject to all of the risks described in this form k  including risk factors operational risks the development and operation of our mining projects involve numerous uncertainties 
declining gold prices could reduce our estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves and could result in delays in development until we can make new estimates and determine new potential economic development options under the lower gold price assumptions 
in addition to adversely affecting our mineral reserve estimates and our financial condition  declining gold prices could impact operations by requiring a reassessment of the feasibility of all or a portion of a particular project 
a reassessment might be the result of a management decision or could be required under financing arrangements related to the project 
even if the project is ultimately determined to be economically viable  the need to conduct a reassessment could cause substantial delays or might interrupt operations until the reassessment can be completed 
we are subject to a number of operational hazards that can delay production or result in liability to us 
our activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards including environmental hazards  discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals  industrial accidents  labor disputes  supply and shipping problems and delays  unusual or unexpected geological or operating conditions  slope failures  cave ins of underground workings  failure of pit walls or dams  fire  changes in the regulatory environment  and natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods and earthquakes 
these or other occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining  delayed production  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
we could incur liabilities as a result of pollution and other casualties 
satisfying such liabilities could be very costly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our mining operations are subject to numerous environmental laws  regulations and permitting requirements that can delay production and adversely affect operating and development costs 
we cannot assure you that compliance with existing regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to environmental protection  in the jurisdictions where we have projects will not have a material adverse effect on our exploration activities  results of operations or competitive position 
new or expanded regulations  if adopted  could affect the exploration or development of our projects or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 
a significant portion of our recently acquired dunkwa property and portions of our wassa development property as well as some of our exploration properties in ghana are located within forest reserve areas 
although dunkwa and 
table of contents wassa have been identified by the government of ghana as eligible for mining permits subject to normal procedures and a site inspection  there can be no assurance that permits for projects in forest reserve areas will be issued in a timely fashion  or at all  or that such permits will not contain special requirements with which it is burdensome or expensive to comply 
our planned development of wassa  relocation of the processing plant to bondaye near prestea  conversion of the existing bogoso prestea processing plant to process refractory sulfides and other activities will require mining and other permits from the government of ghana 
there can be no assurance that these permits will be issued on a timely basis or at all  or that permits issued will not be subject to requirements or conditions with which it is burdensome or expensive to comply 
this could adversely affect our projected production commencement dates  production amounts and costs 
as a result of the foregoing risks  project expenditures  production quantities and rates and cash operating costs  among other things  could be materially and adversely affected and could differ materially from anticipated expenditures  production quantities and rates  and costs 
in addition  estimated production dates could be delayed materially 
any such events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the development and operation of our mining projects involve numerous uncertainties 
mine development projects  including our ongoing development at wassa and anticipated expansion at bogoso prestea  typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible 
development projects are subject to the completion of successful feasibility studies and environmental assessments  issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing 
the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors such as estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources  anticipated metallurgical recovery rates  environmental considerations and permitting  future gold prices  and anticipated capital and operating costs of such projects 
our mine development projects could have limited relevant operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements 
estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves and operating costs determined in feasibility studies are based on geologic and engineering analyses and might not prove to be accurate 
any of the following events  among others  could affect the profitability or economic feasibility of a project unanticipated changes in grade and tonnage of ore to be mined and processed  unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions  incorrect data on which engineering assumptions are made  costs of constructing and operating a mine in a specific environment  availability and cost of processing and refining facilities  availability of economic sources of power  adequacy of water supply  adequate access to the site including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  unanticipated transportation costs  government regulations including regulations relating to prices  royalties  duties  taxes  permitting  restrictions on production  quotas on exportation of minerals  as well as the costs of protection of the environment and agricultural lands  fluctuations in gold prices  and accidents  labor actions and force majeure events 
adverse effects on the operations or further development of a project could also adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
because of these uncertainties  and others identified in risk 
table of contents factors  there can be no assurance that our production estimates at bogoso prestea and wassa can or will be achieved 
we need to continually obtain additional mineral reserves for gold production 
because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves  we must continually replace and expand our mineral reserves as our mines produce gold 
at current average production rates  we estimate that bogoso prestea has over ten years of mine life  but our estimates might not be correct and the mine life would be shortened if we expand production 
our ability to maintain or increase our annual production of gold will be dependent in significant part on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand or extend the life of existing mines 
gold exploration is highly speculative  involves substantial expenditures  and is frequently non productive 
gold exploration  including the exploration of the prestea underground  involves a high degree of risk and exploration projects are frequently unsuccessful 
few prospects that are explored end up being ultimately developed into producing mines 
to the extent that we continue to be involved in gold exploration  the long term success of our operations will be related to the cost and success of our exploration programs 
we cannot assure you that our gold exploration efforts will be successful 
the success of gold exploration is determined in part on the following factors the identification of potential gold mineralization based on superficial analysis  the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise  and the capital available for exploration and development 
substantial expenditures are required to determine if a project has economically mineable mineralization 
it could take several years to establish proven and probable mineral reserves and to develop and construct mining and processing facilities 
as a result of these uncertainties  we cannot assure you that current and future exploration programs will result in the discovery of mineral reserves  the expansion of our existing mineral reserves and the development of mines 
we face competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties 
we face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing  or capable of producing  precious metals 
many of these companies have greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities 
as a result of this competition  we might be unable to maintain or acquire attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
consequently  our revenues  operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
title to our mineral properties could be challenged 
our policy is to seek to confirm the validity of our rights to title to  or contract rights with respect to  each mineral property in which we have a material interest 
however  we cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged 
title insurance generally is not available  and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions could be severely constrained 
we might not have conducted surveys of all of the properties in which we hold direct or indirect interests and  therefore  their precise area and location could be in doubt 
accordingly  our mineral properties could be subject to prior unregistered agreements  transfers or claims  and title could be affected by  among other things  undetected defects 
in addition  we might be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties 
we depend on the services of key executives 
we are dependent on the services of key executives including our president and chief executive officer and a small number of highly skilled and experienced executives and personnel 
due to the relatively small size of our company  the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could adversely affect the exploration and development of our properties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future operations 

table of contents the period of weak gold prices prior to resulted in the depletion in the number of trained and experienced professionals and managers in our industry 
higher gold prices have resulted in an increased demand for these people  and it could therefore be more difficult to attract or retain such experienced professionals and managers without significantly increasing the cost to golden star 
our insurance coverage could be insufficient 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally  including adverse environmental conditions  industrial accidents  labor disputes  unusual or unexpected geological conditions  ground or slope failures  cave ins  changes in the regulatory environment  and natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods and earthquakes 
such occurrences could result in damage to mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others  delays in mining  monetary losses  and possible legal liability 
although we maintain insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable  our insurance might not cover all the potential risks associated with our business 
we might also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
insurance coverage might not continue to be available or might not be adequate to cover any resulting liability 
moreover  insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to us or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms 
we might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we cannot insure against or which we might elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons 
losses from these events might cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations 
governmental and regulatory risks as a holding company  limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us could adversely affect the funding of our operations 
we are a holding company that conducts operations through foreign principally african subsidiaries and joint ventures  and substantially all of our assets consist of equity in these entities 
accordingly  any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between the parent corporation and these entities  or among these entities  could restrict our ability to fund our operations efficiently 
any such limitations  or the perception that such limitations might exist now or in the future  could have an adverse impact on our valuation and stock price 
we are subject to changes in the regulatory environment where we operate 
our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive regulation governing various matters  including licensing production taxes water disposal toxic substances development and permitting exports imports labor standards occupational health and safety 
table of contents mine safety environmental protections compliance with these regulations increases the costs of the following planning designing drilling operating developing constructing closure and reclamation we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations in ghana and elsewhere 
however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and reinterpretation 
due to the substantial increase in mining development during in ghana  the government of ghana has been reviewing the adequacy of reclamation bonds and guarantees throughout the country and in some cases has requested higher levels of bonding than previously had been required 
there can be no assurance that our bonds would not be increased 
amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation or interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us  cause a reduction in levels of production and delay or prevent the development or expansion of our properties in ghana 
government regulations limit the proceeds from gold sales that could be withdrawn from ghana 
changes in regulations that increase these restrictions could have a material adverse impact on us  as bogoso prestea is currently our only source of internally generated operating cash flows 
the government of ghana has the right to participate in the ownership and control of certain subsidiaries 
the government of ghana currently has a carried interest in our subsidiaries that own our bogoso prestea mine  wassa development property and prestea underground property 
the government of ghana also has a the right to acquire up to an additional equity interest in each of these subsidiaries for a price to be determined by agreement or arbitration  b the right to acquire a special share or golden share in such subsidiaries at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and such subsidiaries might agree  and c a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by such subsidiaries 
we cannot assure you that the government of ghana would not seek to exercise one or more of these rights  which could reduce our equity interest 
a reduction in our equity interest could reduce our income or cash flows from bogoso prestea and or reduce our anticipated income or cash flows from wassa  reducing amounts available to us for reinvestment and adversely affecting our ability to take certain actions 
we are subject to risks relating to exploration  development and operations in foreign countries 
certain laws  regulations and statutory provisions in certain countries in which we have mineral rights could  as they are currently written  have a material negative impact on our ability to develop or operate a commercial mine 
for countries where we have exploration or development stage projects  we intend to negotiate mineral agreements with the governments of these countries and seek variances or otherwise be exempted from the provisions of these laws  regulations and or statutory provisions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in obtaining mineral agreements or variances or exemptions on commercially acceptable terms 
our assets and operations are affected by various political and economic uncertainties  including the risks of war  civil unrest  coups or other violent or unexpected changes in government  political instability and violence  expropriation and nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits  and contracts  illegal mining  changes in taxation policies  restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation  and changing political conditions  currency controls  and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 

table of contents illegal mining occurs on our properties  is difficult to control  can disrupt our business and can expose us to liability 
artisanal miners illegally work on our properties from time to time  despite the fact that we have hired security personnel to protect our properties 
the presence of illegal miners could lead to project delays and disputes regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits 
the work performed by the illegal miners could cause environmental damage or other damage to our properties  or personal injury or death for which we could potentially be held responsible 
extensive illegal mining could result in surface depletion of mineral deposits  potentially making the future mining of such deposits uneconomic 
our activities are subject to complex laws  regulations and accounting standards that can adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate and financial results 
our business  mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to extensive canadian  us  ghanaian and other foreign  federal  state  provincial  territorial and local laws and regulations governing exploration  development  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  waste disposal  protection of the environment  reclamation  historic and cultural resource preservation  mine safety and occupational health  toxic substances  reporting and other matters  as well as accounting standards 
compliance with these laws  regulations and standards or the imposition of new such requirements could adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate and financial results 
market risks the market price of our common shares could experience volatility and could decline significantly 
our common shares are listed on the american stock exchange and the toronto stock exchange 
securities of small cap companies have experienced substantial volatility in the past  often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved 
these factors include macroeconomic developments in north america and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries 
our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short term changes in gold prices or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports 
other factors unrelated to our performance that could have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business could be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not continue to follow our securities  the trading volume and general market interest in our securities could affect an investor s ability to trade significant numbers of common shares  the relatively small size of the public float will limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities  and a substantial decline in our stock price that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from the american stock exchange and the toronto stock exchange  further reducing market liquidity 
as a result of any of these factors  the market price of our common shares at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long term value 
securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies 
table of contents following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
we could in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management s attention and resources 
you could have difficulty or be unable to enforce certain civil liabilities on us  certain of our directors and our experts 
we are a canadian corporation 
substantially all of our assets are located outside of canada and the us  and our head office is located in the us 
additionally  a number of our directors and the experts named in this form k are residents of canada 
although we have appointed koffman kalef  suite  west georgia street  vancouver  british columbia and field llp   th avenue sw  calgary  alberta as our agents for service of process in the provinces of british columbia and alberta respectively  it might not be possible for investors to collect judgments obtained in canadian courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities legislation 
it could also be difficult for you to effect service of process in connection with any action brought in the us upon such directors and experts 
execution by us courts of any judgment obtained against us or  any of the directors  executive officers or experts named in this form k in us courts would be limited to the assets of golden star resources ltd 
or the assets of such persons or corporations  as the case might be  in the us 
the enforceability in canada of us judgments or liabilities in original actions in canadian courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the us is doubtful 
there may be certain tax risks associated with investments in our company 
potential investors that are us taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for federal income tax purposes 
although we believe that we currently are not a pfic and do not expect to become a pfic in the near future  the tests for determining pfic status are dependent upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we can not assure you that we would not become a pfic in the future 
if we were deemed to be a pfic  then a us taxpayer who disposes or is deemed to dispose of our shares at a gain  or who received a so called excess distribution on the shares  generally would be required to treat such gain or excess distribution as ordinary income and pay an interest charge on a portion of the gain or distribution unless the taxpayer makes a timely qualified electing fund election a qef election 
a us taxpayer who makes a qef election generally must report on a current basis his or her share of any of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain for any taxable year in which we are a pfic  whether or not we distribute those earnings 
special estate tax rules could be applicable to our shares if we are classified as a pfic for income tax purposes 
we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business 
we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  and current and anticipated cash needs 
future sales of our common shares by our existing shareholders could decrease the trading price of the common shares 
sales of a large number of our common shares in the public markets  or the potential for such sales  could decrease the trading price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of our common shares 
we completed sales of units  comprised of common shares and warrants  in january  july and december and february and sales of common shares in august  october  and december  all but the december offering at prices significantly less than the current market price of our common shares 
accordingly  a significant number of our shareholders have an investment profit in our securities that they could seek to liquidate 
substantially all of our common shares not held by affiliates can be resold without material restriction in the us and canada 
the existence of outstanding rights to purchase common shares could impair our ability to raise capital 
as of december  approximately million common shares are issuable on exercise of warrants  options or other rights to purchase common shares at prices ranging from cdn to cdn 
during the life of the warrants  options and other rights  the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common shares with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders 
our ability to obtain additional financing during the period such rights are outstanding could be adversely affected  and the existence of the rights could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares 
the holders of the warrants  options and other rights can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital by new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding rights

mining in ghana ghanaian ownership and special rights ghana is situated on the west coast of africa  approximately kilometers north of the equator on the gulf of guinea 
accra  the capital city of ghana  is located on the prime meridian 
after a period as a british colony  ghana achieved independence in and it is now a republic with a democratically elected government 
ghana has a population of approximately million people 
english is the official and commercial language 
the total land area of the country is approximately  square kilometers and the topography is relatively flat 
ghana has a tropical climate with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons  each year 
rights to explore and develop a mine are administered through the minerals commission  a governmental organization designed to promote and control the development of ghana s mineral wealth 
a company or individual can apply to the minerals commission for a renewable exploration concession granting exclusive rights to explore for a particular mineral in a selected area for a period of two years 
when exploration has successfully delineated a mineable mineral reserve  an application is made to the minerals commission for conversion to a mining lease  granting a company the right to produce a specific product from the concession area for a period of normally to years 
production must begin within two years of the date of granting a mining lease 
the government of ghana has a carried interest in bgl and wgl  and is entitled to acquire up to an additional interest in each of bgl and wgl 
the carried interest entitles the government of ghana to a pro rata share of future dividends none have been declared to date  if any  from bgl and wgl once all capital is repaid  and the government of ghana has no obligation to contribute development or operating expenses 
bgl and wgl owe million and million  respectively  to golden star as of december  for past advances and debts and such amounts would be repaid to us before payment of any dividends 
if the government of ghana wishes to exercise its right to acquire an additional  it must first give reasonable notice  and pay a mutually agreed price 
if there is no agreement  the purchase price would be the fair market value of such interest at such time as determined by arbitration conducted by the international centre for the settlement of investment disputes 
the government of ghana could also acquire further interests in bgl and or wgl on terms mutually acceptable to the government and bgl or wgl 
to date the government has indicated no intent to obtain additional ownership in any of our properties 
the government of ghana is entitled to acquire a special or golden share in bgl or wgl or any mining company at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and bgl or wgl might agree 
the special share would constitute a separate class of shares with such rights as the government of ghana and bgl or wgl might agree 
in the absence of such agreement  the special share would have the following rights the special share would carry no voting rights  but the holder would be entitled to receive notice of and attend and speak at any general meeting of the members or any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares  the special share could only be issued to  held by  or transferred to the government or a person acting on behalf of the government  
table of contents the written consent of the holder of the special share would be required for all amendments to the organizational documents of the company  the voluntary winding up or liquidation of the company or the disposal of any mining lease or the whole or any material part of the assets of the company  and the holder of the special share would be entitled to the payment of a nominal sum of  ghanaian cedis in a winding up or liquidation of the company in priority to any payment to other members and could require the company to redeem the special share at any time for a nominal sum of  cedis 
bgl and wgl have not issued nor to date been requested to issue any such special share to the government of ghana 
the government of ghana has a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by bgl and wgl 
the purchase price would be such price as the government of ghana and bgl and wgl might agree on  or the price established by any gold hedging arrangement between bgl or wgl and any third party approved by the government  or the publicly quoted market price prevailing for the minerals or products as delivered at the mine or plant where the right of preemption was exercised 
the government of ghana has agreed to take no preemptive action pursuant to its right to purchase such gold or other minerals so long as bgl and wgl sell gold in accordance with certain procedures for selling gold approved by the bank of ghana 
ghanaian royalty requirements under the laws of ghana  a holder of a mining lease is required to pay quarterly a royalty of not less than per annum and not more than per annum of the total revenues earned from the lease area 
the government of ghana determines the royalty percentage each year based on the ratio that the operating margin bears to the value of gold produced from a mining lease in that year 
based on the mineral royalty regulation of  the royalty is when the operating ratio is or less  the royalty increases for each increase in operating ratio until the royalty reaches a maximum of at an operating ratio of 
in  and the royalty rate for bgl was of revenues  and the amounts paid were million  million and million  respectively 
the royalty payments from golden star have not exceeded per annum in any year 
ghanaian environmental regulations bgl and wgl are in substantial compliance with the environmental requirements imposed by ghanaian laws and guidelines and applicable guidelines and standards published by the world bank 
bgl completed significant work during to identify the outstanding reclamation liabilities for bogoso prestea and to prepare a rehabilitation work plan 
significant work has been performed during  and to advance this plan and to reduce the outstanding reclamation liability 
expenditures for ongoing rehabilitation work  including the capping of sulfide material  backfilling of worked out pits  and the contouring and re vegetation of waste dumps  were approximately million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
as at december  bgl had million of restricted cash set aside for environmental reclamation of the bogoso mine 
a reclamation liability of million was recognized upon the acquisition of the wassa property in september  this amount representing the discounted estimated cost of reclamation as of the date of the acquisition 
community development programs in mid we initiated an alternative livelihood and sustainable development program in the bogoso prestea area 
in we plan to expand the program to wassa 
the goals of the program are to assist the communities in the vicinity of our mining operations to create alternative employment opportunities  promote growth of sustainable economic development and to reduce the community s dependence on mining 
given the importance of agriculture in the local economy  much of our efforts have been focused on agricultural opportunities 
a demonstration farm has been established at one of the backfilled pits at prestea where we now have a fish farm  a mulberry plantation and a silk production and processing facility 
we plan to add demonstration plots of citrus crops and ginger in studied have shown that chinese silk production has fallen in recent years  providing an opportunity for new supply centers  and the climate of western ghana appears to be well suited to sericulture 

table of contents the farm facility is used for training and assistance to the local farmers who have signed up to participate in the program 
in addition  the farm is providing participants with seed stock and fish and silk worms for use on their own farms 
working with local ghanaian government agencies  we have encouraged formation of agricultural cooperatives  the first of which has recently obtained a plot of ground in the prestea area to initiate a silk operation 
we have also made contact with various non governmental developmental groups in hopes of facilitating availability of micro project financing for the bogoso prestea communities 
during we are planning to provide two new oil palm palm kernel processing facilities in the local area to more efficiently process the palm oil production already existing in the area 
in addition to the alternative livelihood projects  we are involved in the ongoing funding of several community assistance projects 
we have provided funding and assistance for school improvements and equipment  libraries  a day care center  community centers  potable water systems  sports facilities and toilet facilities 
operating properties the bogoso prestea operation overview of the bogoso prestea operation bogoso prestea consists of a gold mining processing operation located along the ashanti trend in western ghana  approximately kilometers northwest of the town of tarkwa from which it can be reached by paved roads 
the mining areas at prestea are linked to the bogoso processing plant by paved and gravel haul roads located on our properties 
equipment and facilities at bogoso prestea include several open pit mines  a nominal  tonne per day cil gold processing plant and a fleet of haul trucks  loaders and mining support equipment 
in addition  there are numerous ancillary support facilities such as power and water supply equipment  haul roads  housing for management and technical staff  a medical clinic  tailings storage facility  waste dumps  warehouse  maintenance shops  offices and administrative facilities 
the bogoso prestea properties cover square kilometers and mining rights are granted through several mining leases  which expire in or after august commercial mining at bogoso dates back to the early years of the th century 
during its year period of operations from to  production totaled over  ounces of gold at an average recovered grade of g t 
underground mining has been conducted at prestea for more than years 
from to  the current prestea property was comprised of a number of different licenses operated by independent mining companies  which  in  were amalgamated by the government of ghana into prestea goldfields limited  under the aegis of the state gold mining corporation 
bgl started surface mining operations on the prestea concession in september  with the first ore being processed at the bogoso processing plant in october total gold production from the prestea area since recorded mining commenced in the s is reported by the ghana chamber of mines to be in excess of nine million ounces  making it the second largest historical gold producing area in ghana  after the obuasi mine 
the bogoso property was acquired for a total cost of million in a series of transactions beginning in with the final contingent payments being made in february in  we acquired a interest in the adjoining prestea property for total consideration of approximately million from barnato exploration limited barnex and prestea gold resources limited 
barnex retained a royalty interest in prestea  which varied  according to a gold price formula  from a minimum of per ounce at gold prices less than per ounce to a maximum of per ounce at gold prices at or above per ounce 
we bought back all of barnex royalty rights for approximately million in common shares in november bogoso prestea expansion project the known mineral reserves at bogoso prestea can be grouped into three general categories based on the metallurgy of the ore 
they are referred to as a oxide ore which is non refractory and has been successfully processed in the existing bogoso cil and gravity circuits  b non refractory transition and sulfide ores which we expect to 
table of contents successfully process at the bogoso processing plant following the reactivation of the processing plant s flotation circuit in early  and c refractory transition and sulfide ores which would require some form of oxidation process prior to gold recovery 
the oxide ores are found at surface  down to the general level of the water table  while sulfide ores are located at depth 
between these two distinct ore types lies the transition ore  of varying thickness  a zone of partially oxidized ore 
our bogoso prestea reserves at the end of are comprised of approximately oxide ore  transition ores  and sulfide ores on a gold content basis 
the existing bogoso processing plant is configured to process primarily oxide ores 
in recent years additions to the processing plant s equipment made it possible to treat certain transition ores but not all of the transition ores known to exist at bogoso prestea 
gold recovery from oxide ores is typically around to but when processing transition ores the recovery rate drops substantially below this 
in when processing large tonnages of transition ores from the old bogoso pits  the gold recovery rate dropped below 
to facilitate efficient processing of the sulfide and transition ores and to expand the productive capacity of bogoso prestea  we plan to make major modification to the existing bogoso processing plant during and and at the same time add a second processing plant on the prestea property  which will be designed to process oxide ores and other non refractory ores 
in july we purchased a used  tonne per day conventional cil processing plant  associated stores inventory  and a six megawatt powerhouse from an inactive mine site in ghana 
this facility was dismantled in the third and fourth quarters of the year and will be moved to prestea in early during we plan to reassemble this processing plant at a site approximately kilometers south of the town of prestea 
with the appropriate modifications it should be able to process oxide ores and some of the transition ores found at bogoso prestea 
this new processing plant is now referred to as the bondaye processing plant 
we expect the bondaye processing plant to be operational in the fourth quarter of if the required approvals and permits are obtained as expected 
also during and into mid  we plan to modify the existing bogoso processing plant  via the addition of a bio oxidation biox circuit  to process sulfide ore 
the modifications would be done in a manner that will allow the bogoso processing plant to continue processing oxide and transition ores during until the biox modifications are completed 
we expect the bogoso processing plant upgrades to be competed in and at that point begin to process only refractory transition and sulfide ores 
once the bondaye processing plant construction and the bogoso processing plant upgrades are completed  we anticipate being able to process all of the known ore types existing at bogoso prestea and in the surrounding area 
we currently estimate the cost to move  reassemble and modify the bondaye processing plant  to add the biox upgrade to the existing bogoso processing plant  and to expand the mining fleet at bogoso prestea as required to feed the expanded total complex  total about million  not including the million initial purchase cost of the bondaye processing plant 
the biox process is designed to treat refractory gold ores prior to cyanidization by utilizing naturally occurring bacteria capable of oxidizing gold bearing sulfide concentrates under controlled conditions 
prior to the biox process  the ore will be crushed and ground utilizing existing equipment at the bogoso processing plant 
a combination of flotation and gravity circuits  including circuits already at the bogoso processing plant  will then separate a sulfide concentrate from the ore slurry with the gold locked in the matrix of the sulfide minerals 
the bacteria used in the biox process oxidize the sulfide minerals in the concentrate thereby liberating the gold particles which are then recovered by cyanidation 
the bacteria used in the biox process are non pathogenic and pose no health risks 
the biox process has been successfully employed since the mid s with five operations now using the process worldwide including ashanti goldfields company limited s obuasi gold mine located kilometers north of bogoso 
the obuasi mine is currently treating approximately  tonnes of sulfide concentrates per day with gold recoveries averaging 
two new biox processing plants are currently in construction  one in australia and one in kazakhstan 
while all plants constructed to date have reached design capacity in less than three months after start up  there is no assurance that we will achieve similar results 
biox bench and pilot scale tests on bogoso sulfide ores have consistently yielded gold recoveries in excess of 
this compares to achievable by direct cyanide treatment 
the cost of biox treatment is estimated to be 
table of contents approximately per tonne of ore processed 
this is higher than the current operating costs for oxide ores at bogoso  but is expected to be cost effective when compared to other options for treating refractory sulfide ores 
the bogoso prestea expansion plans outlined above are subject to the completion of technical studies now underway  subsequent board approval  obtaining all requisite environmental permits and successful resolution of potential technical difficulties that could be encountered during the construction and start up of the new facilities 
geology at bogoso prestea the bogoso prestea property lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield 
prestea covers a kilometers stretch of the ashanti trend located immediately south of bogoso 
the area is dominated by a major northeast southwest trending structural fault zone referred to as the ashanti trend  which hosts the prestea  bogoso  obuasi and konongo gold deposits  among others 
parallel to the ashanti trend is the akropong trend  which hosts the ayanfuri deposit 
the akropong trend is about kilometers west of the ashanti trend in the bogoso region  and gradually converges with it  converging at obuasi and forming the basis for the world class obuasi deposit  owned and operated by ashanti goldfields company limited

mineral reserves and mineral resources at bogoso prestea bogoso prestea has proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes with a grade of g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before a reduction for the minority interest 
total measured and indicated mineral resources total million tonnes with a grade of g t before a reduction for the minority interest 
the current proven and probable mineral reserves should support mining operations for approximately ten years  although we expect the mine life to be extended as we continue to evaluate mineral resources through ongoing exploration efforts 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this k 
exploration activities at bogoso prestea exploration activities at prestea during successfully delineated additional mineral resources and mineralization at the southern end of the prestea property 
following up on gold in soil anomalies defined in  four meter deep auger drilling was conducted during the first half of the four meter auger program helped to define the traces of gold in the soil and confirmed the existence of mineralized structures below one meter 
areas where deep auger drilling confirmed subsurface gold mineralization was tested further with drilling 
drilling programs have involved two drill rigs  one stepping out on meter spacing and the second drill rig infilling on meter spacing 
the drilling program thus far has tested two sub parallel zones along a combined strike length of seven kilometers 
during we spent million on exploration and completed approximately  meters of drilling 
during we plan to spend approximately million on approximately  meters of drilling at bogoso prestea 

table of contents development stage project the wassa development project overview of the wassa project in september we acquired a interest in the wassa gold property located kilometers east of our bogoso prestea gold operations in ghana and immediately began a drilling program and engineering studies designed to evaluate the economic viability of the property as a conventional  tonnes per day cil gold operation 
based on initial drill results and engineering data  a feasibility study was begun shortly after acquisition and was completed in july in july we announced that the project would proceed and that construction of the cil processing plant would commence immediately 
the feasibility study was prepared by our staff supported by a team of independent consultants led by metallurgical design and management pty ltd 
mdm of south africa 
in july we also awarded a fixed price contract to mdm to construct the new cil plant and associated processing facilities 
wassa is owned by wgl  one of our owned ghanaian subsidiaries 
as with bogoso prestea  the government of ghana holds a carried interest and is not required to contribute any development capital 
any future dividends none have been declared to date would be split and between us and the government of ghana  respectively 
dividend payments are not anticipated until wgl has repaid all capital 
the first phase of the wassa development is now nearing completion 
as of december  development costs totaled million including the feasibility study cost  equipment and construction cost 
in october we paid an additional million to buy out all the debt and royalty obligations due the sellers 
phase two development  which is expected to cost million  would consist of the purchase of a mining fleet and the commencement of mining and is scheduled to occur early in wassa is scheduled to commence production operations in early by processing material from the heap leach pads left by the previous owners 
prior to golden star s acquisition  wassa was operated as an open pit  heap leach operation 
early reprocessing of this material will make the leach pad area available for tailings containment 
construction of the processing plant and cil circuit is well underway  and the construction of the tailings dam is scheduled for early the existing powerhouse at wassa is being supplemented to allow wassa to generate of its own power requirements in the early stages of the project s life until a connection to the local power grid is completed during total production from wassa is expected to be in the range of  to  ounces of gold during at a cash operating cost of approximately to per ounce 
open pit mining is scheduled to commence early in when processing of the heap leach material is nearing exhaustion 
when operating at the planned capacity of million tonnes of ore per year on new ore mined from the open pit  gold production is expected to average  ounces per year  at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
wassa was initially developed in the late s by a consortium of european mining companies and consisted of an open pit mine and a conventional heap leach operation 
while operating as a heap leach property  wassa produced approximately  ounces of gold per annum for a period of just over two years beginning in and ending in mid geology at wassa wassa lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield 
the proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the west african craton and host the major gold mineralization in ghana are subdivided into metasedimentary and volcanic rocks of the birimian  and tarkwaian sequences 
wassa is hosted within the same birimian volcano sedimentary greenstone package as bogoso prestea 
wassa is situated on the southeastern limb of the tarkwa syncline while bogoso and prestea occur along the northwestern limb 
the northwestern belt hosts the obuasi  prestea  and bogoso gold mines but the southeastern limb also is characterized by gold mines and mineral occurrences 
tarkwaian hosted deposits along the south eastern limb include goldfield s tarkwa and abosso mines  while birimian hosted gold occurrences include st 
jude s hwini butre property and wassa 

table of contents mineral reserves and mineral resources at wassa wassa has a probable mineral reserve of million tonnes with a grade of g t containing approximately million ounces of gold before the reduction for the minority interest 
total measured and indicated mineral resources consist of million tonnes with a grade of approximately g t before a reduction for the minority interest 
the current mineral reserves should support mining operations for approximately five years at planned mining rates 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table and the non reserves measured and indicated mineral resource table in item of this k 
exploration activities at wassa exploration at wassa during concentrated on upgrading the mineral resources contained within and around the current engineered pits as well as delineation of mineral resources at a new discovery site approximately kilometers from the wassa processing plant  called south akyempim 
a total of approximately  meters of drilling was completed during soil and stream sampling of the adasse prospecting license  located just north of wassa  was also completed in initial results from adasse were marginal  but results would be evaluated further to see if any additional follow up work is warranted 
two of the three reconnaissance permits applied for in are awaiting final approval from the government of ghana and work is expected to commence during the first half of drilling of the first of several gold exploration targets on the wassa property in ghana has resulted in the discovery of a new higher grade zone intersected with drill holes to date 
the new mineralized zone  located approximately kilometers southwest of the wassa mill has an average drill width and gold assay of approximately seven meters at grams per tonne at depths between the surface and meters below the surface 
additional drilling is planned for to follow up on this initial drilling campaign 
the new zone  which is called south akyempim  was identified in the drilling of the first of six geochemical targets which exist in two parallel trends running in a southwesterly direction over a strike length of approximately six kilometers  south of the known reserves at wassa 
exploration stage properties in ghana prestea underground overview prestea underground is located directly beneath our prestea property and consists of currently inactive underground workings and support facilities 
a program to recondition the two main shafts and their associated hoists for exploration purposes was undertaken during and support facilities include an administrative office  maintenance shops  a warehouse and electrical substations 
the former year old processing plant was dismantled by bgl in to gain access to the surface mineral reserves now being mined by bgl 
access to the mine site is via a paved road maintained by the government of ghana 
a rail line connects the town of prestea to tarkwa  a major mining supply center approximately kilometers to the east  but there is currently no service on the line 
any potential future production from the prestea underground could be trucked to the bogoso processing plant or planned bondaye processing plant for processing 
in march bgl entered into an agreement with prestea gold resources limited  the former operator of the underground mine  and the government of ghana to form a joint venture with bgl as operator and manager  with initial interests of   and  respectively  to evaluate the prestea underground 
bgl initially contributed approximately million to the joint venture for their initial interest  but since that time bgl has funded all of the refurbishment and geological evaluation expenditures and has increased its interest to approximately at the end of  compared to at the end of the prestea underground has produced approximately nine million ounces of gold during the last years  the second highest production of any mine in ghana 
the underground workings are extensive  reaching depths of approximately  meters and extending along a strike length of approximately ten kilometers 
underground workings can currently be accessed via two shafts  one near the town of prestea and a second approximately four kilometers to the southwest 
underground operations ceased in early  following an extended period of low gold prices 

table of contents the prestea underground is contained within a mining lease which covers the same area as the surface mining lease granted to bgl in the surface mining lease extends to a depth of meters below the elevation of the prestea central shaft collar  while the underground mining lease is restricted to material deeper than meters 
the consolidation of the underground mine with the activities of bgl is therefore viewed as a natural progression to the orderly and economic development of the area 
geology of prestea underground the prestea deposits are found along the ashanti trend which extends over kilometers and which accounts for to of the total quartz lode hosted gold extracted in ghana 
other mines located along the same shear are our bogoso pits  and the obuasi and konongo mines owned by others 
two types of gold hosts have historically been recognized at prestea fault related hydrothermal quartz veins  and disseminated sulfide hosted gold mineralization associated with metavolcanic pods  the first type of ore was the focus of intense mining during prestea s past production 
we intend to evaluate both types of mineralization 
mineral resources at prestea underground total inferred mineral resources consist of million tonnes with a grade of g t before a reduction for the minority interest 
see the non reserves inferred mineral resource table in item of this form k 
exploration activities at prestea underground since the creation of the prestea underground joint venture  bgl  as the joint venture manager  has been collating over years worth of data and  meters of the underground workings have been mapped and digitized and entered into our mine and mineral reserve models 
inferred mineral resources at the prestea underground of million tonnes grading g t at have been conservatively categorized as inferred until validation sampling and volumetrics have been confirmed 
while awaiting preparation of access to the less developed and less explored lower levels of the prestea underground workings  we initiated in mid a series of drill holes at shallower levels where access had already been established 
a total of holes were drilled averaging meters in length 
these holes were in areas that had received extensive mining and development in the past 
while some significant intersections were encountered  no major new mineralized zones were discovered 
by the end of we had obtained access to new areas deeper in the mine where we expect to concentrate our efforts in spending at the prestea underground project totaled million during  including facility maintenance  engineering  drilling  geologic activities and equipment purchases 
support crews continue to maintain the underground and surface facilities in good working order and assist our underground drilling teams 
the prestea underground exploration programs for will involve drilling from underground and surface sites 
drilling of targets below the extent of the existing mining will be conducted from a series of hanging wall cross cuts on the lower levels of the mine 
the underground drilling will test the down dip extension of the high grade ore zones which were previously exploited 
akropong trend properties overview of the akropong trend properties we have entered into numerous option agreements of properties along the akropong trend since the acquisition of bgl in september all of the mineral properties are located on the akropong trend and within approximately kilometers from the bgl plant 
in addition to the option agreements  bgl has been granted two prospecting licenses to the south and east of the akropong trend and has one application for a prospecting license on the western side of the trend 
the total surface area of the mineral properties covered in the option agreements and applications is approximately square kilometers 
the objective of this work is to identify additional mineral reserve opportunities in the immediate vicinity of bogoso prestea that could  in the future  provide additional sources of processing plant feed for the bogoso or planned bondaye processing plants 
all these projects are at an 
table of contents early stage of exploration and to date they do not have  and ultimately might not have  proven and probable mineral reserves 
exploration activities at akropong trend properties we spent approximately million on akropong projects during compared to million in exploration work for involved soil geochemistry surveys  mechanized trenching  and drilling to delineate the source of the alluvial gold defined by the stream sampling program initiated in pending positive results from the soil geochemistry  these anomalies will be drilled in dunkwa properties overview of the dunkwa properties in we purchased two prospecting licenses  asikuma and mansiso  along the ashanti trend from birim goldfields inc  which we refer to as the dunkwa properties 
these properties cover kilometers of strike along the ashanti trend directly north of and contiguous with the current bogoso mining lease 
the addition of the asikuma and mansiso prospecting licenses  which cover and square kilometers  respectively  increases our property holdings along this trend to over kilometers in length 
in we also acquired from ashanti goldfields company limited the rights to the mampon prospect located on the asikuma license 
past and present prospects located on the dunkwa concessions have been explored during the s to the present day 
several prospects were discovered in the early s and consist of discontinuous gold bearing quartz veins up to m wide with limited known mineralization in the wall rocks 
the mampon prospect was discovered in using regional geochemical methods and consists of narrow quartz veins with strong pyrite and arsenopyrite mineralization in the wall rocks ranging up to total sulfides 
these prospects are also associated with shearing and or graphitic faults  similar to those seen at bogoso 
there are five known gold prospects on the dunkwa concession 
all of these occur in the same approximate stratigraphic position within lower birimian sediments from to kilometers west of the contact with the birimian metavolcanics 
exploration activities at the dunkwa properties during exploration activities included infill soil geochemistry and establishing drill access 
exploration for is expected to involve drilling over the known occurrences as well as follow up drilling of any new targets generated 
the mampon mineral reserves  located within the dunkwa prospecting licenses  add approximately million tonnes of probable mineral reserves grading g t of gold containing approximately million ounces of gold 
at december  the indicated mineral resource on the dunkwa properties was million tonnes grading g t of gold 
in addition  there are approximately million tonnes of inferred mineral resource at an average grade of g t of gold 
further mineral resource definition drilling during is expected to cost million 
obuom property in we reapplied for a prospecting license on the obuom concession and anticipate that it will be approved in exploration work scheduled for obuom will involve early stage exploration to confirm previous soil geochemical work done by previous owners 
other active properties in africa in late we added and square kilometers of exploration properties in sierra leone and mali  respectively 
the related joint venture agreements  which are subject to definitive documentation and government approvals  allow golden star to earn in up to and  respectively  by sole funding the development of any projects 
firm commitments during the first twelve months of the agreements require us to spend million and million on the sierra leone and mali properties  respectively 
any further spending will be dependent upon the results of the work done during the commitment period 
in addition to the ongoing exploration on the mining leases and existing prospecting and reconnaissance permits  we are actively targeting prospective areas for potential land acquisitions 
target generation will require the acquisition 
table of contents and interpretation of geophysical datasets  compilation of data collected by previous explorers  interpretation of high resolution satellite images and field investigation 
highly prospective areas will be selected from our compilation and interpretation  and we will actively pursue the land position either through joint ventures or staking of available ground 
the south american properties overview of the south american properties we hold one exploration property in suriname known as the saramacca property 
our other properties in south america are located in french guiana and held through guyanor  our owned subsidiary 
french guiana is part of french national territory and has been an overseas d partement of france since under the french constitution  the same laws govern french guiana as metropolitan france  subject to modifications including those affecting tax and mining laws and regulations that could be adopted to reflect the historical  cultural  geographical and economic characteristics of french guiana and provide for regional administration 
at december  guyanor owned mineral rights either directly or through its subsidiaries for the yaou  dorlin  paul isnard  and bon espoir properties 
the bon espoir property was acquired in december and is discussed in more detail below 
during guyanor spent approximately million on care and maintenance of its exploration properties compared to million during acquisition of the bon espoir property in december guyanor acquired the bon espoir property from gold fields exploration b 
v 
for a purchase price of million payable in stock and warrants 
bon espoir is located north of the paul isnard properties in western french guiana 
the purchase price of approximately million will be payable by the issuance of million common shares and million warrants of guyanor subject to various shareholder and governmental approvals 
the terms of the million warrants  which comprise three classes  have exercise prices ranging from per share to per share  and have expiration dates of one to three years 
additional provisions include a sliding scale royalty ranging from to of the net smelter returns and a back in right to acquire a participating interest in a future gold project on the bon espoir property 
the guiana shield transaction in may we sold our interests in the gross rosebel  headleys and thunder mountain properties in suriname  and our interest in omai gold mines limited ogml in guyana  to cambior inc we received million cash in and a million deferred payment in from the sale of the gross rosebel property 
we expect to receive two additional deferred payments of million each in and in addition  cambior agreed to pay us a royalty equal to of the excess of the average quarterly market price above a gold price hurdle on the first million ounces of gold production from gross rosebel 
for soft and transitional rock the gold price hurdle is per ounce and for hard rock the gold price hurdle is per ounce 
for the headleys and thunder mountain properties  we are entitled to receive a deferred consideration of million each  when and if cambior commences commercial mining from these properties 
as payment for our equity interest and preferred shares in ogml  we received a release and waiver from ogml  cambior and the guyana government in respect of all liabilities  of any nature  related to the omai gold mine 
in the transaction golden star also acquired cambior s interests in the yaou and dorlin exploration properties in french guiana 
cambior has stated that gross rosebel s commercial gold production is scheduled to begin in early and total approximately  ounces of gold during cambior is projecting  ounces of gold per year average production over the mine s projected nine year mine life 
based on cambior s announced gold production schedule  we expect royalty payments from gross rosebel of approximately million in  assuming current gold prices 
saramacca property two successive soil auger sampling programs were completed in late and early to evaluate the to kilometer long by to kilometer wide series of stream sediment gold anomalies 
a total of approximately 
table of contents million of direct field related costs were spent in each of the and field programs 
field work has included establishment of an kilometer long by to kilometer wide auger grid  with kilometers of cut lines 
grid line spacing was to meters with one meter auger samples taken on meter line spacings 
for  approximately million of exploration spending will be focused on a deep augering and mechanized trenching campaign 
positive results would likely be followed up in late or with drilling to establish potential subsurface grades  as well as defining limits of the system 
the saramacca property is held directly by golden star 
bon espoir property the area is covered by the bon espoir exclusive exploration permit  dated october  and valid until october  this permit covers an area of square kilometers 
financial commitments for the first five year period of validity ending october   are million  of which million has already been spent in detailed exploration work on the wayamaga prospect which lies within the bon espoir property soil geochemistry  drilling 
planned work in consists of regional soil geochemistry to test the totality of the kilometer long prospective contact 
the yaou and dorlin properties the yaou exploration permit covers an area of square kilometers located some kilometers southwest of cayenne  french guiana 
the dorlin exploration permit covers an area of square kilometers located some kilometers southwest of cayenne and kilometers east of maripasoula 
in the yaou and dorlin properties remained on care and maintenance and expenditures totaled less than million 
there is no significant work planned at yaou or dorlin in paul isnard property the paul isnard property is located in the western part of french guiana  approximately kilometers west of cayenne 
the concessions held will expire on december  but can be renewed for an additional years 
the paul isnard exploration permit covers an area of square kilometers  and we are waiting for the granting of its first renewal for a reduced surface area 
the total area under or awaiting permit is square kilometers 
paul isnard remained on care and maintenance during and total costs incurred were less than million 
there is no significant work planned at paul isnard in item legal proceedings we have been named as one of defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in the high court of the supreme court of judicature of guyana on may  related to the august accidental release of cyanide bearing waste into a stream near the omai gold mine  in which we then owned a equity interest 
other defendants include cambior inc  which co owned and operated the mine in and to which we subsequently sold the mine in the plaintiffs claim to represent residents near the stream and its tributaries 
the plaintiffs claim various environmental and other damages and have asked for substantial damages  in excess of billion  from all defendants  jointly and severally  among other remedies 
during the third quarter of cambior filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 
we have not been served with process in this litigation 
while we believe this claim is without merit  we cannot reasonably predict the outcome of this litigation 
in connection with the sale of our interest in the omai mine to cambior in  cambior indemnified us from any claims related to the mine 
we are not currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings 
we are  however  engaged in routine litigation incidental to our business 
no material legal proceedings  involving us or our business are pending  or  to our knowledge  contemplated  by any governmental authority 
we are not aware of any material events of noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations

once all capital has been repaid  the government of ghana would receive of dividends from the subsidiaries owning the bogoso prestea and wassa monies 
our business through our subsidiaries and joint ventures we own a controlling interest in four gold properties in southern ghana the bogoso property bogoso  the prestea property prestea  the wassa property wassa and the prestea underground property prestea underground 
bogoso and prestea are adjoining properties  operating as a single operation and referred to as bogoso prestea 
bogoso prestea and the prestea underground are owned by our owned subsidiary  bogoso gold limited bgl 
we hold a equity interest in wexford goldfields limited wgl  which owns wassa  located some kilometers east of bogoso prestea 
wassa is currently in development  and we expect gold production to commence in early the prestea underground is located on the prestea property and consists of a currently inactive underground gold mine and associated support facilities 
as of december  bgl owned an approximately operating interest in this mine and we are currently seeking to determine if the underground mine can be reactivated on a profitable basis 
we also hold interests in gold exploration properties in ghana  sierra leone  mali  suriname  and french guiana 
the french guiana properties are mainly held through our owned subsidiary  guyanor ressources sa guyanor 
we hold a royalty right on the gross rosebel gold mine in suriname and expect to begin receiving cash royalties from this property during 
table of contents business strategy and development our business and development strategy since has been to focus primarily on the acquisition of producing and development stage gold properties in ghana and on the exploration  development and operation of these properties 
given our significant mineral resource position  we are currently carrying out technical studies to expand our production at bogoso prestea 
at our wassa property  we commenced development in mid  and now expect to commence production in early by processing material from the existing heap leach pads left by the former owner 
in early we plan to commence ore production from the wassa open pit mine 
if the above mentioned expansion and development plans are approved and permitted as expected  our annualized production should exceed  ounces of gold commencing in however  there can be no assurance that development and start up can be completed as anticipated or that our production goals will be achieved 
our objective is to grow our business to become a mid tier gold producer which we understand to be a producer with annual production of approximately  ounces over the next few years 
due to higher gold prices and our improved financial condition  we believe we are well placed to pursue the acquisition of producing  development and advanced stage exploration gold properties and companies  primarily in ghana and elsewhere in africa 
we are actively investigating potential acquisition and merger candidates  some of which have indicated to potential acquirers or their advisors that they or certain of their properties might be available for acquisition 
however  we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any potential transaction 
we have increased exploration activities and expenditures on our current exploration properties  primarily in ghana 
overview of our financial condition showed a significant improvement during with records being set in several operating and financial parameters including  ounces sold  revenues  net income and operating cash flow 
revenues of million were up over  based on a increase in the number of ounces sold and a increase in average realized gold prices 
net income of million was up from the prior year  primarily due to the improved revenues 
our gold sales increased to  ounces  a increase over s level  and the london pm fix gold price  which began the year at per ounce  trended upward though most of to finish the year at per ounce 
the spot price averaged per ounce during our cash balance at the end of was million  an increase of million from million at the end of improvements in gold prices and gold production levels combined to provide million of cash flow from operations  an increase of million as compared to  and equity offerings provided a net million during the year 
we ended with million of debt versus million at the end of in addition several other significant milestones were achieved during in july we completed a feasibility study and established mineral reserves at our wassa development property and immediately initiated construction of a cil processing plant 
we now expect gold production from this property early in  we acquired two new exploration land packages totaling square kilometers extending north of bogoso prestea along the ashanti trend which include  ounces of new mineral reserves at the mampon deposit  we acquired a used  tonne per day cil processing plant which we plan to relocate and reassemble kilometers south of the town of prestea  to facilitate a significant expansion of gold production at bogoso prestea by  we completed public equity offerings which provided a net million of cash  we initiated an underground exploration drilling program in the prestea underground and we continued engineering and geologic studies of the economic potential of the property  we purchased the gold production royalties encumbering bogoso prestea and wassa for approximately million and million  respectively  
table of contents we continued to pursue new growth opportunities for the company  and we added  ounces of new reserves at bogoso prestea and  ounces of new reserves at wassa 
trends affecting our operations during gold prices have now trended generally upward for nearly three years from a low of in early april to per ounce at january   an average annual increase of 
the higher average gold price added approximately million to our revenues during over what we would have realized had gold prices remained at levels 
mining costs were higher in compared to  mainly due to increases in haulage costs and fuel costs  the plant north pit being farther from the bogoso processing plant than were the ore sources mined during waste stripping costs were higher due to increased tonnages moved in processing costs were also higher 
the metallurgical characteristics of plant north ore required more reagents  especially cyanide  and longer retention times during the recovery process 
royalties were also significantly higher as compared to because of the increase in sales revenues 
while mining and processing costs per tonne were higher  the higher grades of the plant north ore and better gold recovery rates more than compensated  yielding a much improved net income and decreases in unit costs per ounce compared to as mining proceeds deeper into the plant north pit in we expect to encounter increasing amounts of harder transition and sulfide ores which are not optimally suited for processing in the bogoso processing plant as currently configured and thus we are expecting lower gold recovery rates and higher processing costs than experienced with the oxide ore milled in to maximize gold recoveries on transition and sulfide ores  the existing flotation circuit at the bogoso processing plant has been refurbished and will be recommissioned during at a cost of approximately million 
once the refurbished flotation circuit is operational  we expect to successfully treat the transition ores from the plant north pit and other areas 
while we expect that gold recovery and processing costs would be at acceptable levels following the flotation circuit refurbishment  we cannot provide assurance that gold recovery will be as high as experienced during and and that operating costs will be as low as those in the market for gold company equities generally strengthened during our common share price began the year at and ended the year at 
the increased interest in investing in gold and gold mining companies during the past two years has made expansion and development capital more readily available 
as a result  we successfully raised a net million of new equity funds during including option and warrant exercises 
we used portions of the cash to pay debt  acquire new exploration properties and reserves in ghana and elsewhere in west africa  to buy back royalties on future bogoso prestea and wassa gold production and to fund exploration and development activities including the work to date on the wassa and prestea underground projects 
in we anticipate using our cash to complete wassa  to proceed with the planned expansion project at bogoso prestea  to continue our evaluation of the prestea underground  to fund other exploration and development activities and for other general corporate purposes 
results of operations compared to net income totaled million or per share on revenues of million for  versus net income of million or per share on revenues of million during higher gold prices  increased gold production  a million gain on currency exchange rates and a million gain on the sale of marketable securities were the major factors contributing to the earnings improvement 
realized gold prices averaged per ounce for the year  a increase from the per ounce realized in gold revenues for were based on sales of  ounces  a  ounce increase from  ounces in 
table of contents financial results gold sold oz average price realized oz revenues in thousands net income loss in thousands net income loss per share basic higher depreciation  depletion and amortization costs are related to higher gold production versus general and administrative costs rose by million from due to increases in compensation expense  including stock option expense  purchase of gold puts  travel and tax and other professional services related to an expanded scope of corporate activities 
the increase in foreign exchange gains is mostly related to the effect of a weakening us dollar offset by the associated impact on the value of cash equivalents invested in canadian dollar instruments 
we did not record a tax expense or benefit during while we have substantial tax assets in canada  france and ghana from past losses  capital allowances and tax pools  a tax valuation allowance has been provided in an amount equal to our net tax assets 
we will continue to monitor our expected future income tax position and may in the future deem it appropriate to recognize certain tax assets and liabilities in our balance sheet 
bogoso prestea operations ore mined t waste mined t ore milled t grade milled g t recovery cash operating cost oz royalties oz total cash cost oz during  bogoso prestea processed an average of  tonnes per day of plant north ore at an average grade of grams per tonne 
this compares to  tonnes per day at grams per tonne in the lower processing plant through put was related to increased amounts of transition ores versus mechanical difficulties with a long lead time component of the processing plant conveyor system during the second quarter of and other processing plant maintenance projects during the year also contributed to the reduced processing plant through put 
recoveries rose to  up from in the improved grade and better recoveries combined to yield a increase in gold production versus bogoso prestea sold  ounces of gold in  up from  ounces in cash operating costs of per ounce were better than the per ounce costs during similarly  total cash costs fell from per ounce in to per ounce in the current year 
compared to during we generated net income of million or per share  compared to a loss of million or per share during the twelve months ended december  the major factors contributing to the improved earnings were higher gold production primarily from prestea ore bodies  improved gold prices  and the absence of write offs of deferred exploration costs 
during much of the bogoso processing plant was fed with transition ores mined from the bogoso pits 
the metallurgical properties of the transition ores render them unsuitable for effective processing in the bogoso processing plant  and a low gold recovery rate of was experienced during as a result 
during the entire bogoso processing plant feed was comprised of oxide ores from various pits on the northern end of the prestea property  and the processing characteristics of these prestea ores were better suited for processing in the bogoso processing plant than were the bogoso transition ores processed in  resulting in a overall recovery rate during the improved recovery added just over  ounces to our production versus what would have occurred had recoveries stayed at the rate of 
revenues rose from million in to million in in addition to the higher gold production for the year  gold prices were higher than in the prior year 
our realized sales price averaged per ounce in  
table of contents up from per ounce in gold shipments totaled  ounces during this increase over was due to the better gold recoveries and an increase in tonnes milled 
while the cost of mining operations  as shown on the statement of operations  increased from the level  mostly due to an increase in the number of tonnes milled  the improvement in gold output yielded a decrease in cash operating cost per ounce  from in to in improved gold recoveries were the most significant factor contributing to the lower cash operating cost per ounce 
development activities wassa in september we acquired a interest in the wassa gold property located kilometers east of our bogoso prestea gold operations in ghana and immediately began a drilling program and engineering studies designed to evaluate the economic viability of the property as a conventional  tonnes per day cil gold operation 
based on initial drill results and engineering data  a feasibility study was begun shortly after acquisition and was completed in july in july we announced that the project would proceed and that construction of the cil processing plant would commence immediately 
the feasibility study was prepared by our staff supported by a team of independent consultants led by metallurgical design and management pty ltd 
mdm of south africa 
in july we also awarded a fixed price contract to mdm to construct the new cil plant and associated processing facilities 
the first phase of the wassa development is now nearing completion 
as of december  development costs totaled million including the feasibility study cost  equipment and construction cost 
in october we paid an additional million to buy out all the debt and royalty obligations due the sellers 
phase two development  which is expected to cost million  would consist of the purchase of a mining fleet and the commencement of mining and is scheduled to occur early in wassa is scheduled to commence production operations in early by processing material from the heap leach pads left by the previous owners 
prior to golden star s acquisition  wassa was operated as an open pit  heap leach operation 
early reprocessing of this material will make the leach pad area available for tailings containment 
construction of the processing plant and cil circuit is well underway  and the construction of the tailings dam is scheduled for early the existing powerhouse at wassa is being supplemented to allow wassa to generate of its own power requirements in the early stages of the project s life until a connection to the local grid is completed during total production from wassa is expected to be in the range of  to  ounces of gold during at a cash operating cost of approximately to per ounce 
open pit mining is scheduled to commence early in when processing of the heap leach material is nearing exhaustion 
when operating at the planned capacity of million tonnes of ore per year on new ore mined from the open pit  gold production is expected to average  ounces per year  at an average cash operating cost of approximately per ounce 
drilling of the first of several gold exploration targets on the wassa property in ghana has resulted in the discovery of a new higher grade zone intersected with drill holes to date 
the new mineralized zone  located approximately kilometers southwest of the wassa processing plant has an average drill width and gold assay of approximately seven meters at grams per tonne at depths between the surface and meters below the surface 
additional drilling is planned for to follow up on this initial drilling campaign 
the new zone  which is called south akyempim  was identified in the drilling of the first of six geochemical targets which exist in two parallel trends running in a southwesterly direction over a strike length of approximately six kilometers  south of the known reserves at wassa 
prestea underground during we completed digitization of information related to the underground workings  old drill records  survey pegs and channel chip samples 
we continued geological mapping of underground workings and geological compilations were completed for several levels 
extensive sampling of underground workings has resulted in the creation of a three dimensional computer model of the underground workings and main zones of mineralization 
for the first time in prestea s year plus history  data from widely different sources and formats have now been 
table of contents standardized and grouped into a single computer database  making interpretation and inferences from modeling much easier 
while awaiting preparation of access to the less developed and less explored lower levels of the prestea underground workings  we initiated in mid a series of drill holes at shallow levels where access had already been established 
a total of holes were drilled averaging meters in length 
these holes were in areas that had received extensive mining and development in the past 
no significant new mineralized zones were discovered 
by the end of the year we had obtained access to new areas deeper in the mine  where we expect to concentrate our efforts in spending at the prestea underground project totaled million during  including facility maintenance  engineering  drilling  geologic activities and equipment purchases 
support crews continue to maintain the underground and surface facilities in good working order and assist our underground drilling teams 
the prestea underground exploration programs for will involve drilling from underground and surface sites 
drilling of targets below the extent of the existing mining will be conducted from a series of hanging wall cross cuts on the lower levels of the mine 
the underground drilling will test the down dip extension of the high grade ore zones which were previously exploited 
bogoso prestea expansion the known mineral reserves at bogoso prestea can be grouped into three general categories based on the metallurgy of the ore 
they are referred to as a oxide ore which is non refractory and has been successfully processed in the existing bogoso cil and gravity circuits  b non refractory transition and sulfide ores which we expect to successfully process at the bogoso processing plant following the reactivation of the processing plant s flotation circuit in early  and c refractory transition and sulfide ores which would require some form of oxidation process prior to gold recovery 
the oxide ores are found at surface  down to the general level of the water table  while sulfide ores are located at depth 
between these two distinct ore types lies the transition ore  of varying thickness  a zone of partially oxidized ore 
our bogoso prestea reserves at the end of are comprised of approximately oxide ore  transition ores  and sulfide ores on a gold content basis 
the existing bogoso processing plant is configured to process primarily oxide ores 
in recent years additions to the processing plant s equipment made it possible to treat certain transition ores but not all of the transition ores known to exist at bogoso prestea 
gold recovery from oxide ores is typically around to but when processing transition ores the recovery rate drops substantially below this 
in when processing large tonnages of transition ores from the old bogoso pits  the gold recovery rate dropped below 
to facilitate efficient processing of the sulfide and transition ores and to expand the productive capacity of bogoso prestea we plan to make major modification to the existing bogoso processing plant during and and at the same time add a second processing plant on the prestea property  which will be designed to process oxide ores and other non refractory ores 
in july we purchased a used  tonne per day conventional cil processing plant  associated stores inventory  and a six megawatt powerhouse from an inactive mine site in ghana 
this facility was dismantled in the third and fourth quarters of the year and will be moved to prestea in early during we plan to reassemble this processing plant at a site approximately kilometers south of the town of prestea 
with the appropriate modifications it should be able to process oxide ores and some of the transition ores found at bogoso prestea 
this new processing plant is now referred to as the bondaye processing plant 
we expect the bondaye processing plant to be operational in the fourth quarter of if the required approvals and permits are obtained as expected 
also during and into mid  we plan to modify the existing bogoso processing plant  via the addition of a bio oxidation biox circuit  to process sulfide ore 
the modifications would be done in a manner that will allow the bogoso processing plant to continue processing oxide and transition ores during until the biox modifications are completed 
we expect the bogoso processing plant upgrades to be competed in and at that point begin to process only refractory transition and sulfide ores 
once the bondaye processing plant construction and the bogoso processing plant upgrades are completed  we anticipate being able to process all of the known ore types existing at bogoso prestea and in the surrounding area 

table of contents we currently estimate the cost to move  reassemble and modify the bondaye processing plant  to add the biox upgrade to the existing bogoso processing plant  and to expand the mining fleet at bogoso prestea as required to feed the expanded processing plant complex  to total about million  not including the million initial purchase cost of the bondaye processing plant 
the biox process is designed to treat refractory gold ores prior to cyanidization by utilizing naturally occurring bacteria capable of oxidizing gold bearing sulfide concentrates under controlled conditions 
prior to the biox process  the ore will be crushed and ground utilizing existing equipment at the bogoso processing plant 
a combination of flotation and gravity circuits  including circuits already at the bogoso processing plant  will then separate a sulfide concentrate from the ore slurry with the gold locked in the matrix of the sulfide minerals 
the bacteria used in the biox process oxidize the sulfide minerals in the concentrate thereby liberating the gold particles which are then recovered by cyanidation 
the bacteria used in the biox process are non pathogenic and pose no health risks 
the biox process has been successfully employed since the mid s with five operations now using the process worldwide including ashanti goldfields company limited s obuasi gold mine located kilometers north of bogoso 
the obuasi mine is currently treating approximately  tonnes of sulfide concentrates per day with gold recoveries averaging 
two new biox processing plants are currently in construction  one in australia and one in kazakhstan 
while all plants constructed to date have reached design capacity in less than three months after start up  there is no assurance that we will achieve similar results 
biox bench and pilot scale tests on bogoso sulfide ores have consistently yielded gold recoveries in excess of 
this compares to achievable by direct cyanide treatment 
the cost of biox treatment is estimated to be approximately per tonne of ore processed 
this is higher than the current operating costs for oxide ores at bogoso but is expected to be cost effective when compared to other options for treating refractory sulfide ores 
the bogoso prestea expansion plans outlined above are subject to the completion of technical studies now underway  subsequent board approval  obtaining all requisite environmental permits and successful resolution of potential technical difficulties that could be encountered during the construction and start up of the new facilities 
exploration we spent approximately million in exploration activities during including million at wassa establishing mineral reserves in the existing pits and in areas outside the pits  million at the prestea underground  including underground care and maintenance costs  approximately million on exploration projects outside the wassa and bogoso prestea areas and million developing new mineral reserves in the plant north area 
exploration spending during was less than expected due to a shortage of drill rigs in ghana 
recent increases in exploration activity in ghana by us and our competitors have adversely impacted drill rig availability and as a result some of our planned work was delayed  including drilling at the prestea underground which was delayed several months 
most of our exploration efforts in were focused on ghana  with prestea underground  prestea  wassa and the akropong trend properties receiving the most attention 
late in we began to explore the newly acquired dunkwa properties north of bogoso 
during we plan to spend approximately million on gold exploration 
approximately million will be used to evaluate surface projects in and around bogoso prestea including the akropong trend and dunkwa properties 
approximately million is planned for the continued exploration efforts at the prestea underground project  million is scheduled for the wassa area  million is expected to be spent on the properties in sierra leone and mali  both in west africa  million is expected to be used to identify and evaluate projects in south america  including some of guyanor s holdings  and million is budgeted for our project generation program 
we entered  subject to definitive documentation and government approval  into a joint venture agreement in late to invest up to million over the next four years in the mano river project in sierra leone via an earn in agreement with a junior exploration company which now holds a group of gold exploration properties in sierra leone 
the initial million  if fully funded we can terminate the joint venture agreement after spending million would yield a interest in the joint venture 
further provisions of the joint venture agreement provide the opportunity to acquire up to of the joint venture by continued long term funding 
spending was nil in 
table of contents in late we entered into a second joint venture agreement  subject to definitive documentation and government approval  agreeing to fund exploration work on the mininko gold property in mali 
funding of million would earn a interest in the joint venture 
we can terminate the joint venture agreement after spending million  of which million was spent in the joint venture agreement provides that we can earn up to an interest by continued funding of exploration and development if warranted 
we also provided million of funding during to a junior exploration company working in south america 
the guyanor properties were maintained on a care and maintenance basis during but we expect to initiate new exploration efforts there in focusing on further evaluation of our existing properties and recently acquired properties 
we do not believe it to be cost effective at this point to add exploration staff or to establish additional exploration offices 
as such  we expect to utilize funding of joint ventures for much of our exploration activities outside the bogoso prestea area where our current exploration staff resides 
liquidity and capital resources equity offerings and profitable operations at bogoso prestea contributed to a million net increase in cash and cash equivalents since december  during we raised a net million from equity offerings  million from exercise of stock options and million from exercises of warrants 
cash flow from operations before working capital changes totaled million  versus million in higher gold prices and higher gold production were responsible for the improvement in cash from operations 
higher gold prices and a higher stock price have generated interest in the gold industry and in our company and allowed us access to the equity markets during there can be no assurance that such favorable market conditions will continue or that we will be able to access the equity markets in the future on such favorable conditions 
investing activities consumed million of cash during the year 
cash spent at wassa on the feasibility study  property holding costs  a royalty buy out  and construction totaled million while development work and new fixed assets at bogoso prestea consumed million including million for the bondaye processing plant purchase 
we spent million on deferred exploration projects  including million on the sulfide project  and invested an additional million in equipment  site maintenance  engineering and geologic analysis at the prestea underground 
miscellaneous items accounted for million 
spending to acquire and develop the mampon property totaled million 
the first of three million deferred payments from the gross rosebel sale in was received early in liquidation of debt  including the million due the sellers of bgl  consumed million of cash leaving only million of debt on the balance sheet at year end 
shareholders equity stood at million at december   up from million at the end of december  and working capital totaled million at december   up from million at the end of outlook we expect that bogoso prestea will continue generating positive operating cash flows in  but will require additional cash for the expansion project described above 
it is anticipated that wassa will also generate a positive operational cash flow once operations begin in early but will need additional funds in late when the mining fleet is purchased 
at december  there was approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we anticipate capital spending of approximately million in amount project millions wassa bogoso prestea prestea underground 
table of contents amount project millions other total looking ahead our main objectives in are continued orderly and efficient mining of prestea plant north ores allowing an adequate flow of oxide and transition ores to the bogoso processing plant  completion of construction and orderly start up of wassa gold production  re assembly of the bondaye processing plant near prestea to treat non refractory ores by the end of  commence conversion of the bogoso processing plant to a biox facility to treat refractory sulfide and transition ores beginning in  continued evaluation of the prestea underground reserve potential  a substantial increase in exploration efforts with a focus on ghana and west africa and follow up of certain properties in south america  continuation of efforts to seek out and evaluate acquisition and growth opportunities in ghana and elsewhere  and evaluate and rationalize our south american assets 
we expect gold production at bogoso prestea of approximately  to  ounces in at a projected cash operating cost of to per ounce and production of approximately  to  ounces at wassa at a cash operating cost of about to per ounce bringing total production to approximately  to  ounces at an average cash operating cost of around to per ounce 
the bogoso prestea production estimate excludes any contribution from the expansion project 
as more fully disclosed in item risk factors  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead our management to make changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above would likely change materially

mining in ghana we continuously evaluate the social and political aspects of ghana and of west africa in general to apprise ourselves of the social situation and political risks that exist in the region 
ghana has benefited from an extended period of political stability and a democratic governmental system including orderly governmental transitions 
it is our belief that ghana is committed to creating a stable political and economic environment that will foster additional economic growth 
ghana is endowed with abundant mineral resources and is actively pursuing policies designed to support expansion of its mineral industry 
because of the political stability and supportive policies  several international mineral companies have initiated activities in ghana in recent years and we understand that these companies now have in place plans to invest significant new sums in gold exploration and development 
it is our intent to be a responsible corporate citizen of ghana and as such we have worked diligently to establish excellent working relationships with both local and federal governmental authorities as well as with the local citizens in the areas surrounding our operations 
we have experienced ongoing incidents of artisanal miners illegally working on our properties in ghana 
while we are sympathetic to the economic needs of those engaged in this activity  illegal mining typically results in uncontrolled environmental damage and is often conducted in an unsafe manner 
in addition  failure to discourage illegal mining on our properties could jeopardize legal title to our mineral rights 
as such we have sought to discourage this activity both by dialogue and by establishing a security presence 
the governmental authorities in western ghana are aware of the illegal mining situation and have been of assistance in our efforts to discourage such activity 
seasonality most of our operations are in tropical climates which experience annual rainy seasons 
mining operations are not materially affected by the rainy seasons in ghana but exploration efforts in ghana and in the guiana shield in south america are generally timed to avoid the rainy periods to ease transportation logistics associated with wet roads and swollen rivers

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements reflect the application of cdn gaap  which is different in certain material respects from us gaap 
the accounting policies reflected therein are generally those applied by similarly situated mining companies in canada 
our accounting policies under canadian gaap are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
accounting policies relating to asset impairments  deprecation and amortization of mine property and property plant and equipment  and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves  gold recoveries  future gold prices and future mining activities 
decisions to write off or not to write off all or a portion of our investment in various properties  especially exploration properties  subject to impairment analysis are based on our judgment as to the actual value of the properties and are therefore subjective in most cases 
in recent years we have written off substantially all of our pre investments in exploration properties based upon our assessments of the amounts recoverable from these properties 
additional exploration properties were found to be impaired in the current period and were written off during we continue to retain title to certain properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have significant value 
mine properties recorded on our financial records are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable reserves 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
accruals of site reclamation and closure costs involve estimates of the extent and timing of future environmental disturbances  the cost of and technology available to reclaims such disturbances  changing environmental requirements  mine life and reserves to be mined

table of contractual obligations payment due by period more contractual obligations less than than as of december  total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap   item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we currently have minimal debt and thus no material interest rate exposure related to debt 
when appropriate we invest excess cash in short term debt instruments of the united states and canadian governments and their agencies on a fixed interest rate basis 
over time the rates received on such investments may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
as a result our investment income may fall short of expectations during periods of lower interest rates 
we estimate that given the cash balances expected during  a one percent change in interest rates would result in a million change in interest income 
we may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the price of gold is denominated in united states dollars and the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in united states dollars 
to the extent there are fluctuations in local currency exchange rates against the dollar  the devaluation of a local currency is generally economically neutral or beneficial to the operation because local salaries and supplies will decrease against the us dollar revenue stream 
approximately of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in canadian dollar treasury notes at december  while we have realized exchange gains on such investments during  a decrease in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar could result in exchange losses 
we currently do not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure 
commodity price risk we are engaged in gold mining and related activities  including exploration  extraction  processing and reclamation 
gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
according to current estimates  a change in the price of gold would result in a million change in pre tax earnings and cash flows during we have in the past purchased puts but we have no puts outstanding at the end of we may in the future more actively manage our exposure through hedging programs
