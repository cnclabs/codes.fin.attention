item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
except for the historical matters contained herein  statements made in this annual report are forward looking and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act of the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended march  and as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for intangible assets 
the value of our intangible assets  including brand licenses and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review intangible assets for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually during the company s fourth quarter of each fiscal year for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets involves the estimation of the fair value of the related asset 
the estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about discounted expected future cash flows 
future cash flows can be affected by changes in industry or market conditions 
allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant certain of our unrelated us department store customers the right to return product which does not sell through to consumers 
at the time of sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
it is only after the specific gift giving season mother s day  christmas  etc 
that the customer requests approval of the return for unsold items 
we decide to accept returns on a case by case basis 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the allowance for returns and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  reducing net income or increasing net loss 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectable accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
inventory write downs 
we record inventory write downs for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
if there are changes to these estimates  or changes in consumer preferences  additional inventory write downs may be necessary 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination 
since april we have not made any changes of these critical accounting policies  nor have we made any material changes in any of the critical accounting estimates underlying these accounting policies 
significant trends 
over the last few years  a significant number of new prestige fragrance products have been introduced on a worldwide basis 
the beauty industry in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing with consumer preferences 
the initial appeal of these new fragrances  launched for the most part in us department stores  has fueled the growth of our industry 
department stores continue to lose sales to the mass market as a product matures 
to counter the effect of lower department store sales  companies are required to introduce new products more quickly  which requires additional spending for development and advertising and promotional expenses 
we believe this trend will continue 
if one or more of our new product introductions would be unsuccessful  it could result in a reduction in profitability and operating cash flows 
comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   net sales increased to  compared to  for the same period for the prior year 
the increase is mainly attributable to the launch of perry m  perry f  and red for men and women under the perry ellis line of fragrances  which resulted in an increase of  in total perry ellis brand gross sales from  to  and  the launch of ocean pacific for men and women  which resulted in an increase in total ocean pacific brand gross sales of  these increases were offset by the reduction in gross sales of animale and fhbh brand products of  and  respectively which brands were sold and sublicensed during january and march  respectively and a  reduction in gross sales of jockey brand products 
the jockey license agreement expires on december   and we do not anticipate significant sales of such products during the remaining term 
net sales to unrelated customers decreased to  compared to  for the same period in the prior year  as a result of the reductions discussed above 
additionally  the prior year period included the launch of perry man and perry woman  for which current period gross sales decreased  compared to the prior launch year period 
net sales to related parties increased to  compared to  for the same period in the prior year  as brands  which were originally launched in the us department store market over the last few years reached full distribution potential 
in addition  the products launched during the current period have been developed for immediate distribution in all of the company s channels 
we anticipate that this trend in distribution channels will continue until the launch of a new perry ellis brand fragrance product  and the launch of the initial guess fragrance product  both of which are anticipated during the fall and winter season 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other entities that include all of the costs related to their distribution network in costs of goods sold as compared to our allocating only a portion of these distribution costs to costs of goods sold and including the remaining unallocated amounts as selling and distribution expenses 
our overall cost of goods sold remained relatively stable as a percentage of net sales  decreasing from for the fiscal year ended march  to for the current comparable period 
cost of goods sold on sales to unrelated customers and related parties both approximated for the current period  as compared to and  respectively  for the same period in the prior year 
the increase in cost of goods sold to unrelated customers for the current period was due to the purchase by unrelated parties of a higher percentage of value sets than in the prior year 
these value sets have a higher cost of goods when compared to basic stock items 
for the last two fiscal years  the cost of goods sold to unrelated customers has increased  and consequently gross margins have decreased  due to a greater number of value sets sold as discussed above 
for the near future  we anticipate the percentage of value sets sold to unrelated customers will remain constant and that the overall cost of goods sold to unrelated customers will also remain relatively constant 
the current year period also includes the sale of a higher percentage of basic stock items to related parties  which result in higher margins 
operating expenses increased slightly compared to the same period in the prior year from  to  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
however  individual components of our operating expenses experienced more significant changes 
advertising and promotional expenses decreased to  compared to  in the prior year period  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the prior year period included promotional costs for perry man and perry woman  which launched during the fall of no such major launches occurred during the current year period 
selling and distribution costs increased slightly to  in the current period compared to  for the same period of the prior year  decreasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase was mainly attributable to increases in employee salaries and health insurance premiums offset by a reduction in commissions paid to an international sales representative who previously sold fhbh products in the caribbean and to reduced commissions to a sales representative in mexico 
these commission reductions will not continue to effect future periods 
during the current period  the company increased its focus on the mexican marketplace and engaged a distributor for mexico in lieu of a commissioned representative 
this distributor is owned and operated by individuals related to our chairman and chief executive officer 
general and administrative expenses increased by compared to the prior year period from  to  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to 
the increase is mainly attributable to increases in employee salaries  health insurance premiums  legal and professional fees  and non recurring charitable contributions  offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization decreased by during the current period from  to  royalties increased by in the current period  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to as a result of minimum royalty requirements on jockey brand products 
this trend should not continue as the jockey license expires in december as a result of the above factors  operating income increased to  or of net sales for the current period  compared to  or of net sales for the same period in the prior year 
net interest expense decreased to  in the current period as compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease reflects a lower average balance outstanding under our line of credit as compared to the prior year  coupled with increased interest income generated on notes receivable 
the current year period includes foreign exchange gains of  relating to the sales and collection activities with our canadian distributor  the only country where we assume foreign exchange risk  due to the strengthening of the canadian currency against the us dollar

comparison of the year ended march  with the year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   net sales increased to  as compared to  for the same period for the prior year 
the increase is mainly attributable to the launch of perry by perry ellis for men and women  which resulted in an increase in total perry ellis brand gross sales from  to  and launches of jockey for men and women in the spring of  which added gross sales of  in the current period 
these increases were offset by reductions in gross sales of animale which brand was sold during january and ocean pacific brand products of  and  respectively  as certain products were launched during the prior year period 
net sales to unrelated customers increased to  in the current period  compared to  for the same period in the prior year  as a result of the launches discussed above

the prior year period included the sale of certain close out merchandise to international customers at lower margins 
the increase in cost of goods sold to related parties for the current period was due to the purchase of a higher percentage of value sets for holiday seasons than in the prior year

royalties increased by in the current period  increasing as a percentage of net sales from to due to minimum royalty requirements for the jockey license 
during the prior period  we recorded an impairment charge on the intangibles relating to the adm and bav brands  which were being licensed to unrelated third parties  totaling  this charge was recorded as a result of our decision to sell these two brands to their respective licensees see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these brands and the impairment charge 
as a result of the above  operating income increased to  or of net sales for the current period  compared to an operating loss of  for the same period in the prior year 
the current year period includes other income of  relating to the settlement of our lawsuit with a supplier see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the litigation settlement 
net interest expense decreased to  in the current period as compared to  for the same period in the prior year

the company recorded a  non cash charge during the prior period  representing a writedown for an other than temporary decline in the value of our investment in affiliate  based upon a sustained reduction in the quoted market price of the investment compared to its original cost see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this non cash charge 
income before taxes for the current period was  or of net sales  compared to a loss of  in the same period for the prior year 
giving effect to the tax provision and the deferred tax benefit of  in related to the non cash charge in the prior year  we recorded net income of  for the current period  compared to a net loss of  in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources working capital increased to  at march  compared to  at march   the result of current period s net income  the collection on notes receivable and proceeds of  from the exercise of warrants see item  business  for further discussion and employee stock options  offset by the purchase of treasury stock discussed below 
during the fiscal year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared with  in the prior year 
net cash provided by investing activities decreased to  in the current year period  compared to  in the prior year  the result of cash generated from brand sales licensing in the prior year period 
the current period includes collection on notes receivable in connection with the brand sales licensing 
the cash provided by operating and investing activities during the current year was used to reduce debt  both long term and under our line of credit  as well as repurchase approximately million of our common stock see below 
the prior year period also used cash generated from operating and investing activities to reduce debt as well as repurchase approximately million of our common stock 
additionally  during the current year period  we generated approximately million of cash from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of certain warrants and employee options 
see note d for further discussion 
as of march  and  our ratios of the number of days sales in accounts receivable and inventory  on a day basis  were as follows march  trade accounts receivable unrelated related total inventories calculated on gross trade receivables excluding allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and advertising allowances of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
consistent with prior year periods  the number of days sales in trade receivables from related parties exceed those of unrelated customers  due mainly to the highly seasonal cash flow of perfumania see item customers for further discussion of our relationship with perfumania 
although we expect this trend to continue  based on current information and published information concerning perfumania s increased borrowing capability  we anticipate a continuing improvement in the days outstanding 
due to the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days  we are required to maintain a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit sku  we often produce a six month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
we believe that the significant gross margins on our products outweigh the additional carrying costs 
the increase between and is attributable to recent product introductions  which did not have a full year s sales activity 
as of june   we had repurchased  under all phases of our common stock buy back program  a total of  shares at a cost of  with  shares still available for repurchase under the last program

in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
which was revised in december fin r 
fin r requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we sell our products worldwide with all such sales being denominated in united states dollars 
as a result  we are not at risk to any foreign exchange translation exposure  other than with our canadian distributor where we assume such risk  but could be subject to changes in political and economic conditions in many of these countries 
we closely monitor such conditions and are able  for the most part  to adjust our sales strategies accordingly 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded foreign exchange gains of  relating to sales collection activity with our canadian distribution 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our bank line of credit 
the bank line of credit bears interest at a variable rate  as discussed above under liquidity and capital resources 
we mitigate interest rate risk by continuously monitoring the interest rates and electing the lower of the fixed rate libor or prime rate option available under the line of credit 
as a result of borrowings associated with our operating and investing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
as of march  and  primary source of funds for working capital and other needs was our million line of credit 
of the approximate million and million of short term and long term borrowings on the company s balance sheet as of march  and  respectively  approximately and  respectively  represented fixed rate instruments 
the line of credit  which was not utilized as of march   bears interest at a floating rate of prime plus 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates would increase fiscal year and interest expense by approximately million in each year
