item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview criticare designs  manufactures and markets vital signs and gas monitoring instruments and related noninvasive sensors used to monitor patients in many healthcare environments 
the company sells its products both in the us and in international markets to customers such as hospitals  surgery centers  dental and physician offices  and nursing homes 
in june the company began to focus on selling to oems  and the oem business has been a significant sales channel for the company with of total sales in fiscal the acquisition of alaris medical systems  inc  criticare s largest oem customer  has resulted in an uncertainty as to the extent of the company s future business with alaris 
criticare is implementing two new business initiatives as part of its strategy to develop products for highly technical  growth oriented niche markets 
the first of these initiatives involves monitoring products for anesthesia gases 
in fiscal  the company introduced an anesthesia monitoring product line for sale both under the criticare brand name and for sale to oems 
the second initiative is the development of a highly specialized monitoring system for medical imaging applications 
criticare has entered into an agreement with an oem to jointly develop and exclusively sell font style display inline  font size pt  font family times new roman  serif a highly specialized medical monitoring product to the oem 
in july  criticare shipped the initial prototypes of this monitoring product to this oem 
the company s results of operations in fiscal were adversely affected by its project with an international distributor 
in fiscal  criticare formed a wholly owned subsidiary to supply medical equipment and supplies to medical facilities in countries in the black sea economic zone 
the company set up a standby letter of credit for  on behalf of an international distributor in connection with this project 
the standby letter of credit served as a guarantee for a  line of credit that had been extended by a large austrian bank to the international distributor to fund this project 
criticare also sold equipment to the international distributor  and the international distributor has outstanding accounts receivable due to criticare relating to this equipment 
due to adverse events relating to the international distributor subsequent to the end of fiscal  criticare believes that the project will not generate sufficient cash flow to fund the international distributor s line of credit  which will lead to the standby letter of credit being called  and that criticare will likely be unable to collect the receivable due from the international distributor or to recover the equipment shipped to the international distributor 
as a result  criticare has recognized a charge to other expenses in the amount of  to reserve for the impending call of the letter of credit and has set up an allowance for the expected write off of the receivable in the amount of  a reserve in the amount of  has also been established to satisfy a claim for duties and value added tax associated with importation of products into a foreign country on behalf of the international distributor 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as percentages of net sales 
percentage of net sales years ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research  development and engineering administrative total loss from operations interest expense interest income foreign currency exchange gain loss gain on sale of stock other income loss before income taxes income tax provision net loss fiscal year ended june  compared to june  net sales of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  of net sales generated in fiscal an increase in the number of units shipped was partially offset by a reduction in the average sales price per unit and a decrease in accessory sales in the current year 
the higher unit sales and lower average sales price per unit were driven by a large shipment of pulse oximeters to supply a government tender in mexico 
these units monitor pulse oximetry only and therefore carry a much lower average selling price than the company  s equipment that monitors multiple vital signs parameters 
oem sales in fiscal were  and represented of total sales  compared to  of total sales in fiscal the gross profit percentage of realized in fiscal increased from the generated in the prior year 
the lower margins in the prior year were driven mainly by  in charges to cost of goods sold to increase the obsolescence reserve for inventory associated with discontinued products and for potential obsolete inventory 
charges to cost of goods sold for potentially obsolete inventory totaled  in the current year and this  reduction in charges in the current year increased margins from the prior year 
total operating expenses in fiscal increased by  from the prior year as a  reduction in administrative expenses and a  decrease in research  development and engineering expenses partially offset a  increase in sales and marketing expenses 
a  reduction in legal and consulting fees primarily related to the internal review conducted in the prior year by the company of its import and export procedures was the main contributor to the lower administrative expenses 
in addition  a final payment in the prior year of  made to the company s former ceo and founder to satisfy past severance obligation issues increased administrative expenses in the prior year compared to the current year 
these reductions were partially offset by the increase in bad debt expense of  related to the reserve of the receivable due from the international distributor 
the lower research  development and engineering expenses were mainly due to funding received from an oem business partner to jointly develop a highly specialized monitoring system for medical imaging applications that was partially offset by higher spending to support the project 
the high er sales and marketing expenses were mainly driven by increased spending to promote the company s new line of anesthesia monitoring products and to enter the veterinary market  including the hiring of four direct salespeople to support these efforts 
also contributing to the increase in sales and marketing spending were clinical trials conducted to test enhancements made to one of the company s vital signs parameters

other income in the prior year included the recognition of a  gain on the sale of the company s immtech international  inc stock   in profits from the completion of a medical equipment integration project with an international distributor  an  foreign currency exchange gain related to the company s operation in india  and a  gain on the sale of the company s building 
total other expense in the current year includes a  charge to settle a dispute with a customer over a product installation to avoid litigation 
the company elected to settle this issue rather than incur the significant legal and administrative costs deemed necessary to successfully defend its position 
total other expenses include a  charge for the potential call of a standby letter of credit used to guarantee borrowings by the international distributor 
total other expenses also include a  charge to satisfy a claim for duties and value added tax associated with importation of products into a foreign country on behalf of the international distributor 
fiscal year ended june  compared to june  net sales of million for the fiscal year ended june  were up from the million of net sales generated in fiscal a increase in international sales and a increase in domestic sales drove revenue higher in fiscal an increase in the number of units shipped and an increase in the average selling price per unit  partially offset by a decrease in accessory sales  contributed to the higher revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal oem sales in fiscal increased for the fourth consecutive year to  and represented of total sales  compared to  in fiscal the gross profit percentage of realized in fiscal decreased from the generated in fiscal the main contributor to the lower margins was  of charges to cost of goods sold to increase the obsolescence reserve for inventory associated with discontinued products that was disposed of in the current year and for potential obsolete inventory that was still in stock at the end of fiscal these charges represented of net sales in fiscal and more than offset the favorable impact from higher sales that resulted in a better utilization of fixed manufacturing costs when compared to fiscal the majority of the charges to cost of goods sold  to increase the obsolescence reserve was recorded in the company s fiscal fourth quarter ended june  in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company received revised forecasts from two key business partners that significantly reduced the expected demand for two products for which the company maintained large inventories of component parts 
the company also released its new line of anesthesia monitoring products in the fourth quarter of fiscal  increasing the risk of obsolescence of component parts maintained for its old line of anesthesia monitoring products 
mainly due to these two events that arose in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company increased its reserve for obsolete inventory to million from its  balance at the end of the third quarter of fiscal this increase in the obsolescence reserve in the fourth quarter of fiscal reduced gross margins to and increased the loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal to  total operating expenses in fiscal were almost million higher than fiscal and more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales in fiscal administrative expenses increased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due mainly to legal and consulting fees related to the internal review conducted by the company of its import and export procedures that totaled approximately  also contributing to higher administrative expenses in fiscal were a final settlement of  made to the company s former ceo and founder to satisfy past severance obligation issues and  of increased spending on business and health insurance  utilities  and investor related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were  higher in fiscal than fiscal due mostly to a  increase in employee and dealer commissions in fiscal as compared to fiscal driven by the higher sales and an increase in bad debt expense of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  recoveries of bad debts expensed in prior years more than offset additional provisions expensed  resulting in a credit of bad debt expense of  compared to  of bad debt expense recognized in fiscal in addition  a  increase in combined trade show  travel  and advertising spending to support the rollout of the company s new anesthesia products contributed to the higher sales and marketing expenses in fiscal research  development  and engineering expenses were up  in fiscal over the prior year due mostly to a  increase in combined labor  employee benefits  and project spending costs incurred to launch the company s new line of proprietary anesthesia monitoring products 
total other income was almost million higher in fiscal than fiscal which offset the majority of the increase in operating expenses  resulting in a bottom line net loss of  that was almost  lower than the  net loss in fiscal the other income consisted mainly of a  gain recognized on the sale of the company s investment in immtech international  inc   in profit recognized on a medical integration project with an international distributor  and a  gain on the sale of the company s building 
in addition  the company realized an  foreign currency exchange gain in fiscal related to the company s operation in india compared to a  foreign currency exchange loss recognized in fiscal the company retired its long t erm bank debt in august by using the proceeds from the sale of the company s facility 
this bank debt retirement caused a reduction in interest expense of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal and  consequently  contributed to higher other income in fiscal over fiscal critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  sales returns  inventories  and warranty obligations 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be re asonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies require its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues and the costs of products sold are recognized as the related products are shipped or installed  if there are significant installation costs 
this revenue recognition policy is utilized for shipment of product to customers including both distributors and end users 
revenues for integration contracts where criticare integration acts as an intermediary to supply medical equipment and supplies to medical facilities in countries in the black sea economic zone are recognized on a net basis for services rendered upon completion of the transaction giving rise to the service 
since there was no activity in fiscal for these integration services and the activity for fiscal was not material  they are included in the accompanying statements of operations for fiscal as other income 
estimating allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management analyzes specific accounts receivable as well as historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  foreign currency movements  and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of any of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company also maintains a sales returns reserve in order to estimate potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand  and acceptances of the company s products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns reserve 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the timing of the company s revenue if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
the company maintains a reserve for obsolete inventory that it utilizes to write down inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of the inventory and the estimated market value 
the company determines the adequacy of the obsolescence reserve by considering historical annual usage of component parts and finished goods as well as assumptions about market conditions and forecasted demand 
when items are physically disposed of the amounts are written off against the reserve 
if future product demand is lower than expected or if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the company  additional charges to increase the obsolescence reserve may be required 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was decreased  to  at june  due mainly to the disposal of obsolete inventory that had been reserved for in prior years 
during fiscal  the reserve for obsolete inventory was increased  to  at june  to provide for potential obsolete inventory associated with discontinued products and excess inventory associated with slow moving parts 
product warranty the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped based upon its historical experience providing warranty coverage 
the company s warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from current projections  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
liquidity and capital resources as of june   the company had a cash balance of  that was basically level with its fiscal year end cash balance of  the company has continued to maintain a bank debt free balance sheet since august of when it sold its building and used the proceeds from the sale to retire the bank debt on the facility 
the company has been able to increase its cash position  over the last three fiscal years despite generating losses of  during this period 
non cash expenses consisting primarily of depreciation expense and provisions for obsolete inventory decreased the company s profitability  during the last three fiscal years  but did not impact the company s cash flows 
over the last three fiscal years the company has been able to fund  of cash used in operations and capital spending of  primarily with  of cash provided from the exercise of stock options and  from the sale in fiscal of the company s shares of immtech international  inc stock 
in fiscal   of cash provided from the exercise of  shares under expiring stock options more than offset  of capital spending and  of cash used in operations 
in fiscal  the company generated cash of  through the sale of its shares of immtech international  inc stock and another  of net cash through the sale of its building and the retirement of the debt on the facility 
these cash inflows more than offset the  of cash used in operations and  of capital spending in fiscal the company believes all future capital and liquidity requirements will be satisfied by cash generated from operations  proceeds received from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options  and its current cash balances 
no major capital equipment expenditures are expected in the company s next fiscal year ending june  the company also has a  line of credit currently in place that could be utilized  if necessary 
at june   there were no borrowings outstanding under this line of credit 
the company violated loan covenants under this line of credit related to achieving minimum levels of tangible net worth and income 
the bank waived compliance with these covenants subsequent to year end 
this line expires in november  but is expected to be extended with te rms consistent with the current agreement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has a demand line of credit facility with a commercial bank with interest payable monthly at basis points above the bank s reference rate 
the company had no borrowings outstanding under this bank facility at june    and due historically to the lack of need to borrow from this credit facility and due to the company s current cash position  the company is not subject to financial risk on this obligation if interest rates in the market change significantly 
the company s net sales are primarily denominated in united states dollars  except for a small amount of net sales from the company s operation in india denominated in indian rupees 
as a result  part of the company s accounts receivable are denominated in rupees and translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the indian rupee would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  the company does not use any hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce exchange rate risk
