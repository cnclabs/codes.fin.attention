item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading supermarket chain in the densely populated new york new jersey and philadelphia metropolitan areas  operating supermarkets 
these metropolitan areas contain over of the population in the united states 
all of our supermarkets are located within miles of our corporate headquarters in carteret  new jersey and our company operated and outsourced distribution facilities 
we design our stores to provide customers with one stop shopping with a wide assortment of foods and general merchandise  as well as additional conveniences  including in store full service pharmacies and a wide array of financial services offered by in store banks 
we are a leading filler of prescriptions among our supermarket competitors in the new york new jersey and philadelphia metropolitan areas and  through our agreements with fleet bank and new york community bank  we believe we are the leading provider of in store banking services in our market area 
our sales are derived from the retail sale of products at our stores 
internally  we look to a variety of indicators to evaluate our sales and gross profit performance  including  among others comparable store sales  sales per store  sales per selling square foot  percentage of total sales by department  shrink and department margins 
in fiscal  we continued to focus on increasing comparable store sales  sales per selling square foot and sales per store through programs focused on greater customer service and better store level execution and merchandising  as well as a continued focus on our high sanitation standards 
our operating expenses are primarily incurred from selling  general and administrative costs 
over of these costs are for labor and labor related benefits 
internally  we focus on a variety of indicators to evaluate our expense performance  including  among others labor costs  including labor hours and hourly labor rates and labor related costs such as pension and welfare costs  workers compensation costs and payroll taxes 
in fiscal  we continued to focus on controlling labor costs through a labor buyout initiative and implementation of a new time and attendance system 
selling  general and administrative expenses other than labor and labor related costs include occupancy expenses  supplies and customer accident claims  among others 
in fiscal  we continued to focus on other expense control initiatives through our best ball and focus store programs in which best operating practices are implemented throughout our chain 
major initiatives currently in place or implemented during fiscal include our advertising week was changed to begin on friday resulting in more effective marketing 
store labor buyout initiative and corporate headcount reduction program resulting in reduced labor costs 
best ball program to identify best operating practices and implement these throughout our chain 
focus stores program in which stores identified as having significant upside opportunities are mentored by members of senior management 
mystery shopper program to evaluate and improve customer service 
store level audits of food safety and sanitation 
investments in technology  including a new time and attendance system  a multi year upgrade to our merchandising system and the continuing leverage of our existing systems for increased productivity 
debt reduction through effective asset management 
we believe these programs  together with overall operational improvements  resulted in increased sales metrics and improved productivity in fiscal and will continue to increase sales and improve productivity 
these gains were largely offset by increases in pension and welfare costs  a trend we expect to continue 
as has been our practice in the past  we will continue to evaluate the profitability  strategic positioning  impact of potential competition  and sales growth potential of all our stores on an ongoing basis 
we may  from time to time  make decisions regarding closures  relocations or renovations in accordance with such evaluations 
during fiscal  we opened two new stores of which one was a replacement store  closed two stores and renovated stores 
during fiscal  we plan to open two stores  close one store and renovate stores

summary of operations 
net earnings in fiscal were million compared to a net loss of million in fiscal the increase in net earnings in fiscal compared to a net loss in fiscal was primarily due to lower operating earnings 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of cash flow data in millions weeks ended january  february  february  cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in cash interest resulting from the derivative settlement charge related to the termination and settlement of our million interest rate zero cost collar  partially offset by higher net earnings and less cash used for operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in cash interest paid as a result of the timing of cash interest payments related to the senior subordinated notes 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to lower property and equipment expenditures  partially offset by proceeds of million from the disposition of real estate and lower lease financings 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in property and equipment expenditures 
the increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the repayment of million of our term loan and reduced borrowings under the working capital facility  partially offset by additional borrowings under the senior subordinated notes of million 
the change in financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to borrowings under lease financings and the working capital facility under the credit agreement the working capital facility in fiscal debt service and liquidity 
on january   september  and december  we issued million  million and million  respectively  aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes  which pay cash interest on a semi annual basis august and february 
the proceeds from the issuances of the senior subordinated notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding term loan the term loan b under the credit agreement and to repay in the first quarter of fiscal million of our outstanding industrial revenue bonds 
the senior subordinated notes are unconditionally guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the subsidiary guarantors and contain customary covenants 
the senior subordinated notes restrict our ability to declare cash dividends on our common stock 
we are in compliance with all senior subordinated notes covenants as of january  the credit agreement initially consisted of a term loans in an aggregate principal amount of million consisting of million in term loan a and million in term loan b and b a million revolving working capital facility including a maximum of million in letters of credit 
after giving effect to the prepayment of indebtedness with the proceeds of the offerings of the senior subordinated notes  term loan a has been paid in full and term loan b has a balance of million 
on january   the company amended its credit agreement the january amendment 
pursuant to this amendment  among other things  the maximum permitted leverage ratio was increased through fiscal  the minimum consolidated interest and rental expense coverage ratio was decreased through fiscal  the minimum permitted consolidated ebitda was decreased through fiscal  and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant was added 
additionally  the company agreed to i an increase in the commitment fee on the working capital facility of basis points  and ii an increase in the applicable interest rates payable on outstanding balances under the credit agreement of basis points 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain covenants which  among other things  place limits on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  issuance of cash pay preferred stock  repurchase of company stock  incurrence of liens  sale leaseback transactions  hedging activities  sale or discount of receivables  investments  loans  advances  guarantees with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  capital expenditures  mergers and consolidations  changing lines of business  repayments of other indebtedness  amendments to organizational documents and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the credit agreement contains customary events of default  including without limitation  payment defaults  material breaches of representations and warranties  material covenant defaults  certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency  and a change of control 
in addition  the credit agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends 
we are in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement as of january  borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates equal to libor plus an applicable margin  subject to decrease  depending on the total debt to consolidated ebitda ratio 
borrowings under the working capital facility and term loan b bear interest at rates of libor and libor  respectively 
we are required to repay a portion of the borrowing under term loan b each year  so as to retire such indebtedness in its entirety by july  the working capital facility expires on july  the weighted average interest rate in effect on all borrowings under term loan b was during fiscal as of january   borrowings under the working capital facility were million and outstanding letters of credit were million 
all of the obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the company s owned subsidiaries  except the company s nonguarantor subsidiaries  which are comprised of four owned and consolidated single purpose entities 
each of these single purpose entities owns the real estate on which a supermarket leased to pathmark is located 
the obligations under the credit agreement and those of the subsidiaries guaranteeing the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s tangible and intangible assets including  without limitation  intellectual property  real property  including leasehold interests  and the capital stock in each of these subsidiaries 
we believe that cash flows generated from operations  supplemented by the unused borrowing capacity under the working capital facility and the availability of capital lease financing will be sufficient to provide for our debt service requirements  working capital needs and capital expenditure program for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels or that we will maintain our ability to borrow under the credit agreement 
there are no credit agency ratings related triggers in either our credit agreement or in the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes that would adversely impact the cost of borrowings  annual amortization of principal or related debt maturities 
contractual obligations and commitments 
we enter into a variety of legally binding obligations and commitments in the normal course of our business 
the table below presents our long term contractual obligations and commitments that represent known future cash payments that we will be required to make under existing contractual arrangements 
some amounts are based on management s estimates and assumptions and amounts actually paid may vary from those reflected below 
the following table presents contractual obligations as of january  in millions payments due by fiscal years total and and thereafter debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other liabilities total debt and capital lease obligations include principal payments only 
operating lease obligations  net of sublease income of million  are approximately million 
in addition to the purchase obligations reflected in the table above  we enter into supply contracts to purchase products for resale in the ordinary course of business 
this category of contracts covers a broad spectrum of products and sometimes includes specific merchandising obligations relative to those products 
these supply contracts typically include either a volume commitment or a fixed expiration date  pricing terms based on the vendor s published list price  termination provisions  and other standard contractual considerations 
our obligation related to these contracts is typically limited to return of unearned allowances and therefore no amounts have been included above 
purchase obligations shown above relate to the outsourcing of a major portion of our distribution  trucking and information systems functions through long term agreements  as noted below 
we have a supply agreement with c s  expiring in fiscal  pursuant to which c s supplies substantially all of our grocery  frozen and perishable merchandise requirements 
under our arrangement with c s  we negotiate prices  discounts and promotions with vendors 
we pay c s a per case upcharge  and have annual minimum case commitments 
the table above reflects this minimum upcharge 
during fiscal  the products supplied from c s accounted for approximately of all of our supermarket inventory purchases 
this agreement may only be terminated for cause or certain events of bankruptcy by either party 
in april  we entered into a five year outsourcing agreement with ibm to continue to provide a wide range of information systems services  which commenced in under the agreement  ibm provides data center operations  mainframe processing  business applications and systems development to enhance our customer service and efficiency 
the charges under this agreement are based upon the services requested at predetermined rates 
amounts above include the specified termination charge if we were to terminate the agreement 
we also have an agreement  expiring in fiscal  with a local trucking company to provide us with trucking services 
under this arrangement  there is an annual fixed fee in addition to transportation charges 
the fixed fee is reflected in the table above 
we may terminate this agreement with a payment of a specified termination charge 
other liabilities include estimated self insured obligations  estimated unfunded pension liabilities  and estimated post retirement and post employment obligations 
we had outstanding letters of credit of million as of january   of which million were standby letters of credit covering primarily self insured or performance obligations 
the remaining million were commercial letters of credit supporting purchases of imported products 
guarantees in the normal course of business  we have assigned to third parties various leases related to former businesses that we sold as well as former operating pathmark supermarkets the assigned leases 
when the assigned leases were assigned  we generally remained secondarily liable with respect to these lease obligations 
as such  if any of the assignees were to become unable to continue making payments under the assigned leases  we could be required to assume the lease obligation 
as of january   assigned leases remain in place 
assuming that each respective assignee became unable to continue to make payments under an assigned lease  an event we believe to be remote  management estimates our maximum potential obligation with respect to the assigned leases to be approximately million  which could be partially or totally offset by reassigning or subletting such leases 
we have recognized a liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  of approximately million  which represents certain guarantees attributable to our secondary liability in connection with assigned leases assigned after december  capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including property acquired under capital leases and technology investments  were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal capital expenditures included million and million in technology spending in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  we opened two stores of which one was a replacement store  closed two stores and renovated stores 
during fiscal  we opened seven stores including one former grand union store we purchased in fiscal of which three were replacement stores  closed one store and renovated stores 
in fiscal  our capital expenditure plan is to invest approximately million in new stores  major store renovations and technology investments 
during fiscal  we plan to open two stores  close one store and complete store renovations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the following accounting policies are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
it is our accounting policy to assess the carrying value of our long lived assets for possible impairment based on an individual store basis to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their related undiscounted cash flows 
we estimated future cash flows based on economic and business assumptions and have concluded that there is no impairment of such assets at january  however  our estimates project cash flow several years into the future and could be affected by variable factors such as inflation and economic conditions 
impairment of goodwill 
we adopted sfas no 
effective with the beginning of fiscal with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer being amortized but rather is being evaluated for impairment at least annually 
based on an independent evaluation of its fair value completed when sfas no 
was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
we performed the annual evaluation of our goodwill in the fourth quarters of fiscal and fiscal  and  based on this independent evaluation of fair value  concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
since such impairment evaluation is based on economic and business assumptions  the goodwill impairment evaluation in the future could be affected by changes in these business and economic conditions  changes in consumer spending  the competitive environment in which we operate and other risks detailed elsewhere in this report 
pension plans 
pension income for all our pension plans was million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions 
the expected return on assets of our qualified pension plan the qualified plan represents the weighted average of expected returns for each asset category  which have been developed using information from a number of third party consultants and long term historical data on returns for different asset categories and inflation 
we also considered the qualified plan s historical year and year compounded returns of and  respectively  which have exceeded broad market returns over comparable periods  indicating a significant premium has been gained through active management of plan assets 
based on these factors and the asset allocation discussed below  we elected to use a expected return on plan assets in determining pension income for fiscal this represents a decrease from the expected returns on plan assets used in determining pension income for fiscal and fiscal both assumptions were net of expected plan expenses payable from the trust fund  which are less than of plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on our qualified plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return of  and with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of 
because of market fluctuation  our actual asset allocation as of december  was with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
we believe  however  that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
an additional reduction in our expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets  holding all other factors constant  would have reduced our pension income during fiscal by approximately million 
we base our determination of pension expense or income  in part  on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a three year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market value of assets 
as of january   we had cumulative net actuarial losses of approximately million  due to the differences between expected and actual return on plan assets  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
these unrecognized net actuarial losses result in decreases in our future pension income depending on several factors  including future asset gains and losses and whether such gains and losses  as recognized at each measurement date  together with other actuarial experience recognized  exceed the corridor in which gains and losses are not amortized  in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the discount rate that we use for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency at the end of the calendar year 
the discount rate determined on this basis has decreased from as of february  to as of january  pension income is sensitive to the discount rate and salary increase assumptions used 
a decrease in the discount rate and salary increase assumptions used would have decreased pension income during fiscal by approximately million 
based on an expected return on plan assets assumption of  a discount rate of and our various other relevant current assumptions  we estimate that our pension income for all pension plans combined will approximate million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal actual pension income in the future will depend on future investment performance  changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the populations participating in our pension plans 
the value of our qualified plan assets has increased from million at december  to million at december  the investment performance returns have increased the overfunded status of our qualified plan  net of benefit obligations  from million at december  to million at december  we believe that  based on our actuarial assumptions and due to the overfunded status of our qualified plan  we will not be required to make any cash contributions to our qualified plan for at least the next three years 
self insured claims liabilities and postemployment benefits 
we are self insured for claims relating to customer  associate and vehicle accidents  as well as certain associate medical and disability benefits  and we maintain third party excess insurance coverage for such claims 
it is our accounting policy to record a self insured liability  as determined actuarially on a consistent basis  based on the facts and circumstances of each individual claim filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported discounted at a risk free interest rate 
all claims and their related liabilities are reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning such claims is subject to variability primarily due to external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  benefit levels and claim settlement patterns 
at january   liabilities for self insured claims and benefits were million and for postemployment benefits were million 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

under the new guidance  there are new effective dates for companies that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
these rules are effective for financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of fin no 
r is not expected to have any impact on our financial statements  as we do not have any variable interest entities 
in january  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for subsequent investments in an investee after suspension of equity method loss recognition 
this issue states that if an additional investment  in whole or in part  represents  in substance  the funding of prior losses  the investor should recognize previously suspended losses only up to the amount of the additional investment determined to represent the funding of prior losses 
whether the investment represents the funding of prior losses  however  depends on the facts and circumstances 
the guidance in this issue is applied to additional investments in equity method investees made subsequent to february   and previously suspended cumulative losses existing at the time of that investment 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no

in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 application of issue no

the adoption of sfas no 
revised did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of this statement permits a sponsor to make a one time election to defer accounting for the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the prescription drug act 
the prescription drug act  signed into law in december  establishes a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
this statement does not provide specific guidance as to whether a sponsor should recognize the effects of the prescription drug act in its financial statements 
the prescription drug act introduces two new features to medicare that must be considered when measuring accumulated postretirement benefit costs 
the new features include a subsidy to the plan sponsors that is based on of an individual beneficiary s annual prescription drug costs between and  and an opportunity for a retiree to obtain a prescription drug benefit under medicare 
we have elected to defer adoption of this statement due to the lack of specific guidance 
therefore  the net postretirement benefit costs disclosed in the our financial statements do not reflect the impact of the prescription drug act on the plan 
the deferral will continue to apply until specific authoritative accounting guidance for the federal subsidy is issued 
authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and  when issued  could require information previously reported in the company s financial statements to change 
we are currently investigating the impact of sfas no 
s initial recognition  measurement and disclosure provisions on our financial statements
