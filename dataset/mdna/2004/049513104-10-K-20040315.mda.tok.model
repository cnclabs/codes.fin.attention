overview we are a leading provider of semiconductor ic products 
we leverage our expertise in nonvolatile memories by combining them with microcontrollers  digital signal processors  rf devices  and other logic to enable our customers to rapidly introduce leading edge electronic products that are differentiated by higher performance  advanced features  lower cost  smaller size  longer battery life and more memory 
our products are used primarily in the following markets communications  consumer electronics and computing  storage  automotive  security and imaging 
we design  develop  manufacture and sell our products 
we develop process technologies ourselves to ensure they provide the maximum possible performance 
we manufacture more than of our products in our own wafer fabrication facilities  or fabs 
beginning late in the fourth quarter  the global semiconductor industry began to experience a severe downturn that continued through early our revenue and profitability were significantly impacted by this downturn with the effect that our net revenues declined sequentially in and the decrease was a result of both shipping fewer units and decreasing average selling prices 
rapid declines in revenue had an adverse impact on our profitability in and because significant portions of our costs are fixed  resulting in operating losses 
in response to these market conditions we made several reductions in our workforce and recorded impairment charges for our wafer fabrication facilities  which further adversely impacted our results 
in the third quarter of  we closed the company s inch wafer fabrication facility at irving  texas  resulting in a significant charge 
although we incurred net losses for   and  we still generated cash from operating activities in each year 
during and  we used this cashflow to significantly reduce our outstanding debt 
at the end of  our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash balances totaled million  down from million at the end of fiscal  after repayments of million in capital leases and convertible bonds during during  we experienced a modest recovery in revenue  and despite a loss for the year  achieved a small profit for the fourth quarter of the year 
included in this profit was million in other income received as a result of a legal award  partially offset by million in asset impairment charges 
our outlook for is to achieve moderate revenue growth  which we project will result in a modest profit for the year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical 
table of contents accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we generate our revenue by selling our products to oems and distributors 
our policy is to recognize revenue upon shipment of products to customers  where shipment represents the point when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use the percentage of completion method for recognizing revenues on fixed fee design arrangements 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery  and shipment terms are mostly fca seller s facility 
we assess whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
sales terms do not include post shipment obligations except for product warranty  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we allow certain distributors  primarily based in the united states  rights of return and credits for price protection 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits to these distributors  we defer recognition of revenue from sales to these distributors until they have resold our products 
deferred revenue for distributor sales were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
sales to certain other primarily non us based distributors carry either no or very limited rights of return 
we have historically been able to estimate returns and other credits from these distributors and accordingly have historically recognized revenue from sales to these distributors on shipment  with a related allowance for potential returns established at the time of our sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we must make estimates of potential future product returns and revenue adjustments related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends in the semiconductor industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue may result 
we provide for sales returns based on our customer experience  and our expectations for revenue adjustments based on economic conditions within the semiconductor industry 
atmel s reserve for sales returns was approximately million at december  and we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable by analyzing specific customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts  and current economic trends 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and at december  it was million 
accounting for income taxes in calculating the income tax expense  it is necessary to make certain estimates and judgements for financial statement purposes that affect the recognition of tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce net income in the period such determination is made 

table of contents our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
our tax calculations may  however  be subject to audit by the respective tax authority 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
this expense is recorded in the period that the liability is identified 
to the extent that it is ultimately determined that the liability is less than that originally accrued  the excess liability is reversed and a tax benefit is recognized 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than what we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
valuation of inventory our inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
average cost includes labor  materials  and depreciation and other overhead costs  as well as factors for estimated production yields and scrap 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods 
we primarily utilize selling prices in our period ending backlog for measuring any potential declines in market value below average cost 
any adjustments for market value provision is charged to cost of revenues at the point of market value decline 
we provide inventory allowances for excess and obsolete inventories 
the allowance is determined primarily by future demand forecasts  and is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based on future demand 
charges to increase the allowance are charged to cost of revenues 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower costed inventory is subsequently sold  the related allowance is matched to the movement of related product inventory  resulting in lower costs and higher gross margins for those products 
our inventories include high technology parts that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate we may be required to take additional inventory write downs 
product and process technology costs that we incur to acquire product and process technology are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over two to five years 
capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the technology or the term of the technology agreement 
fixed assets atmel reviews for impairment the carrying value of fixed assets when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require our judgment  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for atmel s products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  we must use our judgment in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
our business requires heavy investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but can quickly become significantly underutilized or rendered obsolete by rapid changes in demand for semiconductors produced in those facilities 
we estimate the useful life of our manufacturing equipment  which is the largest component of our fixed assets  to be five years 
we base our estimate on our experience with acquiring  using and disposing of equipment over time 
depreciation expense is a major element of our manufacturing cost structure 
we begin depreciation on new equipment when it is put into use for production 
the aggregate amount of fixed assets under construction for which depreciation was not being recorded amounted to million at december  and million at december  
table of contents litigation the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we are currently involved in such intellectual property litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and have not accrued a liability for such litigation 
we regularly evaluate current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made 
an estimated liability would be accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we were to determine that such a liability was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the adjustment would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations amounts in millions and as a percent of net revenues net revenues gross margin research and development selling  general administrative restructure and other charges loss from operations net revenues net revenues improved to  million in from  million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase resulted from higher shipment volumes  especially for asic and microcontroller products  as a result of new products introduced in and improved market conditions 
net revenues for decreased million  or  from  million in the decline was caused largely by reductions in average selling prices for most of our products 
the commodity memory portion of the semiconductor industry  in which we sell our nonvolatile memory products  suffered from excess capacity since late in the fourth quarter  which led to greater than normal price erosion during  and net revenues by operating segment our operating segments now comprise application specific integrated circuits asics  microcontroller products microcontroller  nonvolatile memory products nonvolatile memory  and radio frequency and automotive products rf and automotive 
our net revenues by segment are summarized as follows in thousands segment asic microcontroller nonvolatile memory rf and automotive net revenues asic asic segment revenues increased by or million to million in  and grew or million in compared to both and saw higher unit shipments  partially offset by lower 
table of contents average selling prices 
the majority of this growth came from increased revenues in smart card and arm based digital products 
smart card products saw growing demand for applications requiring small memory with high security  such as gsm cell phone applications  banking and government security 
arm based digital products benefited from introduction of new design wins for disk on key and other consumer type electronics 
microcontroller the microcontroller segment revenues increased or million to million in  following a decrease of or million in compared to the growth in can be attributed to sales of our proprietary avr microcontroller products  which we consider to be the fastest bit microcontrollers in the industry 
this product family has benefited from the overall increase in shipments of consumer and industrial electronics  as well as market share gains 
average selling prices were steady to slightly higher in  while volumes increased with demand 
the decline in net revenues in was due to decreases in average selling prices  partially offset by increases in unit shipments 
the decline was caused primarily by a decrease in revenues from product families based on the microcontroller architecture 
nonvolatile memory nonvolatile memory nvm segment revenues were slightly lower in  decreasing by  or million to million compared to million in during  both volumes and pricing for flash products declined significantly due to both a commodity oriented pricing environment  as well as our delays in introducing higher density products 
the decline in revenues from flash products was largely offset  however  by an increase in shipment volumes for our dataflash products along with serial eeprom products 
our dataflash products have gained market share in the serial interface market  and have gained design wins in many consumer electronic products 
nvm net revenues declined by or million in compared to the decrease was caused primarily by a decline in average selling prices  partially offset by higher unit shipments 
while all product families registered lower revenues in compared to  the largest dollar declines occurred in the flash  dataflash and serial eeprom product families 
because nvm products are commodity oriented  they are subject to greater declines in average selling prices than products in other segments of our company 
our nonvolatile memory segment continues to be unprofitable 
competitive pressures and the need to continually migrate to new technology are among several factors causing continued pricing declines 
conditions are expected to remain challenging for the foreseeable future 
rf and automotive rf and automotive segment revenues increased slightly in by million to million  a increase over levels of million 
increases in volumes for automotive and networking applications were offset by decreases in bicmos products 
we have a significant presence in the european automotive sector  which has given us a steady customer base utilizing our products for function controllers  as well as assp s for power train  convenience  and safety systems 
rf communication applications include wlan  gps and car radio products 
decline in volumes for bicmos products is primarily a result of lower oem shipments for legacy cellular phone products 
rf and automotive segment revenues declined by or million in compared to this decrease in revenue was primarily due to an overall decrease in unit shipments and average selling prices in weakness in the rf bicmos and secure product businesses were the significant contributors to the revenue decline in  compared to 
table of contents net revenues by geographic area our net revenues by geographic delivery location see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december   and are summarized as follows in thousands area north america europe asia rest of world total net revenues primarily includes the philippines  south africa  and central and south america over the last several years  revenues have increased significantly in asia  while revenues in the united states and europe have declined 
we believe that part of this shift reflects changes in customer manufacturing trends  with many customers increasing production in asia 
sales outside north america accounted for of net revenues in  of our revenues in  and of our revenues in our sales to north america declined million  or for compared to  and declined million  or in compared to primarily due to slightly higher volume shipments offset by lower average selling prices 
our sales to europe were flat at million when comparing to  and declined million  or in compared to primarily due to flat volume shipments and lower average selling prices 
our sales to asia increased million  or for compared to  but decreased million  or in compared to the increase in was primarily due to much higher volume shipments offset by lower average selling prices  while the decline in was primarily a result of decreasing average selling prices 
revenues and costs impact from changes to currency rates in  approximately of net revenues were denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro

table of contents cost of revenues and gross margin our cost of revenues represents the costs of wafer fabrication  assembly and test operations  and freight costs 
our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues fluctuates  depending on product mix  manufacturing yields  utilization of manufacturing capacity  and average selling prices  among other factors 
gross margin was for compared to for the gross margin percentage improvement is a result of increased capacity utilization  allowing us to ship higher unit volumes while manufacturing costs remained relatively flat 
manufacturing costs also benefited from cost containment programs and the sale of inventory previously reserved  but were partially offset by lower average selling prices  the negative effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  and a patent license charge recorded in march had exchange rates for remained the same as the average exchange rates in effect for  our reported gross margin would have been on march   we entered into a patent license agreement 
in conjunction with this agreement  the company recorded a charge of million that is now included in cost of revenues for the amount was previously recorded in interest and other expense  net  in the quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   but has been subsequently reclassified to cost of revenues 
we made payment in the quarter ended june  gross margin decreased to for compared to for the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues in compared to was caused primarily by decreases in average selling prices of our products as well as decreased utilization of manufacturing capacity  partially offset by a benefit from a reduction of inventory reserves that had been established in previous periods 
products associated with these reserves were sold in during  we put in place additional manufacturing capacity  and corresponding costs  in anticipation of continuing growth in demand for our products 
when demand decreased starting in  we were unable to reduce our fixed manufacturing costs  such as labor  depreciation  maintenance  and supplies as quickly as customer demand declined 
our gross margin has been impacted by the timing of inventory adjustments related to inventory write downs and subsequent sale of these written down products 
the table below sets forth the gross margins and the related impact of inventory adjustments to gross margins as a percentage of net revenues 
gross margins impact of inventory adjustments benefit write down during the fourth quarter of  we realized a benefit of million  or of revenue from the sale of previously written down inventory 
however  this amount was offset by unfavorable adjustments in the first and third quarters of  and resulted in no significant impact on gross margins for the year ended december  in recent periods  average selling prices for some of our semiconductor products have been below manufacturing costs  and accordingly  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition have been adversely affected 
as these charges are recorded in advance of when written down inventory is sold  subsequent gross margins in the period of sale may be higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous write downs 
our excess and obsolete inventory write offs taken in prior years relate to all of our product categories  while lower of cost or market reserves relate primarily to our memory products 
we receive economic assistance grants in some locations as an incentive to achieve certain hiring and investment goals related to manufacturing operations  the benefit for which is recognized as an offset to related costs 
we recognized a million reduction to cost of revenues for such grants in compared to million in  and million in 
table of contents research and development research and development r d expenses in decreased by million or to million from million in primarily due to a decrease in expenditures on process development at our north tyneside  uk wafer fabrication facility as this facility transitioned to production volume levels during the second half of the year 
had exchange rates for remained the same as the average exchange rates incurred in  r d expenditures would have been million lower in r d expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in expenses was caused by various cost control measures  including termination of development at our fabrication facility in irving  texas in connection with making it available for sale in the third quarter of and headcount reductions 
we have continued to invest in r d efforts in a wide variety of product areas and process technologies  including flash  logic  and embedded eeprom cmos technology to be manufactured at and micron linewidths  as well as investments in silicon germanium bicmos technology to be manufactured at micron linewidths 
we have also continued to purchase or license technology in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion 
we believe that continued strategic investments in process technology and product development are essential for us to remain competitive in the markets we serve 
we receive r d grants from various european research organizations  the benefit for which is recognized as an offset to related costs

the decreases were primarily due to cost controls  reductions from lower sales and marketing activities  declines in selling commissions related to lower sales and headcount reductions 
general and administrative costs decreased by million in compared to due to cost controls and headcount reductions 
restructuring charges during the period from fiscal to fiscal  our sales volume grew significantly  from billion to billion 
as business conditions improved during this time  the company took steps to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity 
during the period from january to september  we spent approximately billion for acquisitions of property and equipment in anticipation of significant growth in our business during  and beyond from the historical levels achieved in beginning late in the fourth quarter  business conditions in the semiconductor industry deteriorated rapidly 
as a result of the difficult operating conditions that existed in the semiconductor industry  we performed asset impairment reviews of our fixed assets during the third quarter of our estimate of fair market value was done by management  which considered an outside appraisal that assumed the assets would continue in use at their current locations 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a million asset impairment charge related to certain of our fabrication facilities in colorado springs  colorado  rousset  france and nantes  france and a million charge related to a headcount reduction in europe 
the charges were part of a restructuring plan that included a workforce reduction and the consolidation of manufacturing operations in both the us and europe 
starting in the fourth quarter of  the asset impairment and restructuring actions taken in the third quarter of  were expected to result in estimated expense reductions of approximately million per year  
table of contents consisting of million reduction in cost of revenues and million reduction in operating expenses 
actual expense reductions are approximately the same as original estimates 
as a result of the downturn experienced in  we delayed the completion of construction of our fabrication facilities in north tyneside  uk  and irving  texas  to  when we anticipated the industry to rebound 
however  after further evaluation of market conditions  we recorded a million asset impairment charge in the second quarter of related to the equipment and facilities for wafer fabrication facilities in irving  texas and north tyneside  uk our estimate of fair market value was done by management  which considered an outside appraisal that assumed the assets would continue in use at their current locations 
in the third quarter of  we reassessed the overall manufacturing capacity of the irving facility against the potential anticipated demand and decided to close the irving  texas facility  without conducting any commercial production there 
the facility was placed on the market for sale in august as a result of the decision to close the facility and make it available for sale  we recorded million of charges in the third quarter of consisting of an asset impairment charge of million  million for terminating contracts with suppliers  employee termination costs of million for employees  and a million charge related to the repayment of a property tax abatement 
also during the third quarter of  we recorded a million reversal of restructuring charges as a result of changes to estimates of termination costs related to headcount reduction charges taken in third quarter of actual costs incurred for the reductions of european employees were lower than original estimates  primarily for severance and re hiring incentives 
we also recorded an asset impairment and restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of this charge relates to plans for reorganizing certain programs and a person workforce reduction in europe 
the asset impairment and restructuring actions taken in the second  third and fourth quarter of was expected to result in a reduction of million in depreciation expense  million in manufacturing services  and of million in employee expenses per year 
actual expense reductions are approximately the same as original estimates 
in december  we re evaluated the status of the fabrication equipment in our irving  texas facility 
because of significant improvements in market conditions  we decided to utilize much of this equipment in other facilities to meet increasing demand 
an asset impairment charge of million to write down asset values to the lower of their then fair value or original net book value  prior to holding these assets for sale less depreciation relating to the period the assets were held for sale  was recorded in the fourth quarter of while this facility was held for sale  assets were not in use  and were not depreciated 
as the equipment is placed into service in  depreciation expense will increase over levels 
we estimate irving equipment and facility will increase depreciation expense approximately million in the restructuring actions underlying the asset impairment and restructuring charges are proceeding as planned 
the asset impairment and restructuring actions resulted in expense reductions of approximately million in  consisting of a million reduction in cost of revenues and a million reduction in operating expenses 
the asset impairment and restructuring actions resulted in expense reductions of approximately million in  consisting of million reduction in cost of revenues and million reduction in operating expenses 
these cost reduction figures exclude subsequent impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
in february  we evaluated various strategic alternatives available to us  including a potential sale of the nantes  france  fabrication facility 
because of improvements in market conditions in the second half of  we have decided to keep our nantes facility to enable us to meet additional capacity requirements 
interest and other expenses  net interest and other expenses  net  increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase is due to a combination of gains recognized in  primarily on the repurchase of convertible notes of million and sale of land in san jose of million 
in addition  we had a lower average level of invested funds  lower interest rates received and higher losses realized on foreign exchange transactions 
interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in due to a decrease in outstanding borrowings 

table of contents interest and other expenses  net  increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase is due to a decline in interest and other income caused by a combination of a lower level of invested funds  lower interest rates received and higher losses realized on foreign exchange transactions  partially offset by larger gains recognized in  primarily on the repurchase of convertible notes of million and sale of land in san jose of million 
interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in due to a decrease in outstanding borrowings 
during the fourth quarter of  we received approximately million from silicon storage technologies  inc sst  constituting the million jury award  plus pre and post judgment interest  granted in relation to the may   judgment by the district court for the northern district of california 
provision for income taxes we recorded tax expense of million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively and an income tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended december  this resulted in an effective tax rate of and for and  respectively  and an effective tax benefit rate of for the income tax expense recorded for resulted primarily from taxes incurred by our profitable foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  we released million of tax reserves related to issues in tax audits that closed during the year the significant increase in income tax expense recorded for is attributed primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets during the year 
during  we made an assessment of its prior two years of losses and determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as a result  substantially all of deferred tax assets were reserved  resulting in income tax expense for the year ended december  the income tax expense was partially offset by tax refunds of million expected to be realized in the us and increased further by additional tax liabilities incurred by our profitable foreign subsidiaries 
our and us federal tax returns are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs 
the irs has completed its examination of our through tax years and we are currently pursuing resolution of all tax issues with the irs appeals division 
we have settled all issues for the through tax years with the irs with no material change in tax expense 
in addition  we have various tax audits in progress in certain us states and foreign jurisdictions that we conduct business 
we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax  interest and penalties that may arise upon resolution of the respective tax issues 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a total of million of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash compared to million at december  current ratio  calculated as total current assets divided by total current liabilities  improved to at december   compared to at december  despite reporting losses during and  we have generated positive cashflow from operating activities  as net losses were impacted by non cash depreciation and asset impairment charges 
we have used this cash generated to reduce our net debt obligations by million to million at december  from million at december  working capital increased by million to million at december  compared to million at december  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in we generated strong operating cash flow in spite of incurring losses due primarily to depreciation  asset impairment charges and other non cash charges reflected in the statement of operations 
accounts receivable increased or million to million at december  from million at december  the average days of accounts receivable outstanding dso improved to days at the end of the fourth quarter of as compared to days at the end of the fourth quarter of our accounts receivable and dso are primarily impacted by shipment linearity  payment terms offered  and collection performance 
we made improvements during in shipment linearity and collection performance 
should we need to offer longer payment terms in the future due to competitive pressures  this could negatively affect our dso 

table of contents inventories decreased by million or to million at december  from million at december  average days of sales in inventory improved to days at december  compared to days at december  inventories consist of raw wafers  purchased specialty wafers  work in process  and finished units 
we are continuing to take measures to reduce manufacturing cycle times and improve production planning efficiency 
however  higher shipment levels  increased process complexity  and the strategic need to offer competitive lead times may result in an increase in inventory levels in the future 
us federal income tax refunds were a significant source of cash from operating activities in both and these refunds were received as a result of taxable losses applied to income taxes paid in prior years on the annual tax returns 
during  restructuring charges and provision for valuation allowance of deferred income tax assets resulted in non cash charges that increased net loss but were added back to arrive at net cash provided by operating activities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities was million in compared to million provided during in the decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to atmel liquidating less of its investments in compared to during  we re deployed under utilized manufacturing equipment and improved manufacturing processes to increase yields and production volumes  which allowed us to significantly reduce fixed asset purchases from million in to million in financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased slightly to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to increased capital leasing in of million versus million in  as well as million of stock repurchase activity in compared to no stock repurchase activity in we believe that our existing balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash flow from operations  equipment lease financing  and other short and medium term bank borrowings  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements over the next twelve months 
net increase in cash and cash equivalents in and  included increases of million and million  respectively  due to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances denominated in foreign currencies 
these cash balances were primarily held in certain subsidiaries in euro denominated accounts and increased in value due to the strengthening of the euro compared to the us dollar during these periods 
net decrease in cash and cash equivalents in included a decrease of million due to the effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances  primarily attributable to the weakening of the euro compared to the us dollar during this period 
during  we expect our operations to generate positive cash flow  however  a significant portion of this cash will be used to repay debt and make capital investments 
the amount of cash we use in will depend largely on the amount of cash generated from our operations 
currently  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million 
in and future years  our capacity to make significant capital investments will depend on our ability to generate substantial cash flow from operations and on our ability to obtain adequate financing

we were in compliance with covenants at the end of if we need to renegotiate any of these covenants in the future  and the lenders refuse and we are unable to comply with the covenants  then we may immediately be required to repay the loans concerned 
in the event we are required to repay these loans ahead of their due dates  we believe that we have the resources to make such repayments  but such payments could adversely impact our liquidity 
our ability to service long term debt in the us or to obtain cash for other needs from our foreign subsidiaries may be structurally impeded 
since a substantial portion of our operations are conducted through our foreign subsidiaries  our cash flow and ability to service debt are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to the us parent corporation 
these foreign subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and may have limited or no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts to us  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
however  the us parent corporation owes much of our consolidated long term debt  including our outstanding issue of convertible notes

table of contents trends  uncertainties and risks our revenues and operating results fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors  which may result in volatility or a decline in our stock price 
our future operating results will be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors  many of which are not within our control 
these factors include the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products ability to meet our debt obligations availability of additional financing the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity fluctuations in manufacturing yields the highly competitive nature of our markets the pace of technological change natural disasters or terrorist acts political and economic risks fluctuations in currency exchange rates our ability to maintain good relationships with our customers integration of new businesses or products third party intellectual property infringement claims ability of independent assembly contractors to meet our volume  quality  and delivery objectives environmental regulations personnel changes business interruptions  and system integration disruptions 
any unfavorable changes in any of these factors could harm our operating results 
we believe that our future sales will depend substantially on the success of our new products 
our new products are generally incorporated into our customers products or systems at the design stage 
however  design wins may precede volume sales by a year or more 
we may not be successful in achieving design wins or design wins may not result in future revenues  which depend in large part on the success of the customer s end product or system 
the average selling price of each of our products usually declines as individual products mature and competitors enter the market 
to offset average selling price decreases  we rely primarily on reducing costs to manufacture those products  increasing unit sales to absorb fixed costs and introducing new  higher priced products which incorporate advanced features or integrated technologies to address new or emerging markets 
our operating results could be harmed if such cost reductions and new product introductions do not occur in a timely manner 
from time to time  our quarterly revenues and operating results can become more dependent upon orders booked 
table of contents and shipped within a given quarter and  accordingly  our quarterly results can become less predictable and subject to greater variability 
in addition  our future success will depend in large part on the resurgence of economic growth generally and of various electronics industries that use semiconductors  including manufacturers of computers  telecommunications equipment  automotive electronics  industrial controls  consumer electronics  data networking equipment and military equipment 
the semiconductor industry has the ability to supply more product than demand requires 
our successful return to profitability will depend heavily upon a better supply and demand balance within the semiconductor industry 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry creates fluctuations in our operating results the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical  characterized by wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant downturns  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
the semiconductor industry faced severe business conditions with global semiconductor revenues for the industry declining to approximately billion in  compared to revenues in the semiconductor industry began to turnaround in with global semiconductor sales increasing modestly by to approximately billion 
in  global semiconductor sales increased to billion 
atmel s operating results have been harmed by industry wide fluctuations in the demand for semiconductors  which resulted in under utilization of our manufacturing capacity and declining gross margins 
in we recorded a million charge to recognize impairment in value of our manufacturing equipment in colorado springs  colorado  rousset  france and nantes  france 
in addition  we recorded a million charge for the costs of reducing our workforce in our european manufacturing operations 
we also recorded an asset impairment charge of million in the second quarter to write down to fair value the book value of our fabrication equipment in irving  texas and north tyneside  uk we recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge in the third quarter of of million  primarily in connection with the closing of our irving  texas inch wafer fabrication facility and making it available for sale 
the charges consisted of costs for reduction in headcount  asset write downs  and expenses associated with our decision to close the facility 
we recorded a restructuring and asset impairment charge in the fourth quarter of million 
this charge related to plans for reorganizing certain programs and a reduction in headcount in europe 
in december  we re evaluated the status of the fabrication equipment in our irving  texas facility and because of increasing demand we decided to utilize much of this equipment in other facilities 
an asset impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of our business may be harmed in the future not only by cyclical conditions in the semiconductor industry as a whole but also by slower growth in any of the markets served by our customer products 
our long term debt could harm our ability to obtain additional financing  and our ability to meet our debt obligations will be dependent upon our future performance 
as of december   our long term convertible notes and long term debt less current portion was million compared to million at december  our long term debt less current portion to equity ratio was and at december  and december   respectively 
our current debt levels as well as any increase in our debt to equity ratio could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend upon our future performance and ability to generate substantial cash flow from operations  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to meet debt obligations or otherwise are obliged to repay any debt prior to its due date  our available cash would be depleted  perhaps seriously  and our ability to fund operations harmed 
our ability to service long term debt or to obtain cash for other needs of the atmel group from our foreign subsidiaries may be structurally impeded 
since a substantial portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries  our cash flow and ability to service debt are partially dependent upon the liquidity and earnings of our subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those 
table of contents subsidiaries as well as the distribution of those earnings  or repayment of loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries  to the us parent corporation 
these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and may have limited or no obligation  contingent or otherwise  to pay any amounts to the us parent corporation  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
however  the us parent corporation owes much of our consolidated long term debt  including our two outstanding issues of convertible notes 
in addition  the payment of dividends or distributions and the making of loans and advances to the us parent corporation by any of our subsidiaries could in the future be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions or depend on other business considerations and be contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries 
any right held by the us parent corporation to receive any cash or other assets of any of our subsidiaries upon its liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors 
although the us parent corporation may be recognized as a creditor  its interests will be subordinated to other creditors whose interests will be given higher priority 
we may need to raise additional capital that may not be available 
semiconductor companies that maintain their own fabrication facilities have substantial capital requirements 
we made capital expenditures aggregating  million in  and  in large part preparing for expected increases in demand 
however  in light of falling demand we have recognized asset impairment charges aggregating million in and we intend to continue to make capital investments to support new products and manufacturing processes that achieve manufacturing cost reductions and improved yields 
currently  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund further enhancement of our wafer fabrication capacity or to fund other projects 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for products  product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
if we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing capacity in line with downturns in our industry or increases in demand  our business could be harmed 
in and  we made substantial capital expenditures to increase our wafer fabrication capacity at our facilities in colorado springs  colorado and rousset  france 
we also currently manufacture our products at our facilities in heilbronn  germany  grenoble  france  and nantes  france 
during economic upturns in the semiconductor industry we may need to increase our manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products in order to achieve and maintain profitability 
during economic downturns in our industry  expensive manufacturing machinery may be underutilized or may need to be sold off at significantly discounted prices  although we continue to be liable to make payments on the debt that financed its purchase 
at the same time  employee and other manufacturing costs may need to be reduced 
since  our gross margin has declined significantly as a result of the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to the expansion of capacity in and and lower unit sales over which to spread these costs 
if the pace of the current economic recovery in the semiconductor industry does not sufficiently improve  our inability to reduce fixed costs  such as depreciation  and employee and other expenses necessary to maintain and operate our wafer manufacturing facilities would continue to harm our operating results 
we announced in the third quarter that we were ceasing high volume production at one of our two wafer fabrication facilities in colorado springs  colorado and at one of our facilities in europe 
we announced in july that we were closing  prior to beginning commercial production  our wafer fabrication facility located in irving  texas that we acquired in  and we have put the facility on the market 
in december  we re evaluated the status of the fabrication equipment in our irving  texas facility 
because of significant improvements in market conditions  we decided to utilize much of this equipment in other facilities to meet increasing demand 
an asset impairment charge of million to write down asset values to the lower of their then fair value or original net book value  prior to holding these assets for sale less depreciation relating to the period the assets were held for sale  was recorded in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents we continue to evaluate the current restructuring and asset impairment reserves as the restructuring plans are being executed and as a result  there may be additional restructuring charges or reversals of previously established reserves 
during economic downturns in our industry we may have to reduce our wafer fabrication capacity 
reducing our wafer fabrication capacity involves significant potential costs and delays  particularly in europe  where we have substantial manufacturing facilities and where the extensive statutory protection of employees imposes substantial costs and delays on their employers when the market requires downsizing 
such costs and delays include compensation to employees and local government agencies  requirements and approvals of governmental and judicial bodies  and losses of governmental subsidies 
we may experience labor union objections or other difficulties while implementing a downsizing 
any such difficulties that we experience would harm our business and operating results  either by deterring needed downsizing or by the additional costs of accomplishing it in europe relative to america or asia 
if we cannot expand our capacity on a timely basis during economic upturns in the semiconductor industry  we could experience significant capacity constraints that would prevent us from meeting increased customer demand  which would also harm our business 
our available cash from operations has not been sufficient to provide significant funding for continued expansion of our facilities or the implementation of new technologies  and may remain insufficient for such purposes if the business conditions do not improve sufficiently 
in light of our losses since the middle of  we may not be able to obtain from external sources the additional financing necessary to fund the expansion of our manufacturing facilities or the implementation of new manufacturing technologies 
if we are unable to effectively utilize our wafer manufacturing capacity and fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields  our business would be harmed 
whether demand for semiconductors is rising or falling  we are constantly required by competitive pressures in the industry to successfully implement new manufacturing technologies in order to reduce the geometries of our semiconductors and produce more integrated circuits per wafer 
we are developing processes that support effective feature sizes as small as microns  and we are studying how to implement advanced manufacturing processes with even smaller feature sizes 
fabrication of our integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process  requiring production in a tightly controlled  clean environment 
minute impurities  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous die on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
we may experience problems in achieving acceptable yields in the manufacture of wafers  particularly when we expand our manufacturing capacity or during a transition in the manufacturing process technology that we use 
we have previously experienced production delays and yield difficulties in connection with earlier expansions of our wafer fabrication capacity or transitions in manufacturing process technology 
production delays or difficulties in achieving acceptable yields at any of our fabrication facilities could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we may not be able to obtain the additional cash from operations or external financing necessary to fund the implementation of new manufacturing technologies 
our markets are highly competitive  and if we do not compete effectively  we may suffer price reductions  reduced revenues  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change  product obsolescence and price decline 
throughout our product line  we compete with a number of large semiconductor manufacturers  such as amd  fujitsu  hitachi  intel  lsi logic  microchip  motorola  sharp  stmicroelectronics and texas instruments 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and management resources than we do 
as we have introduced our new products  we are increasingly competing directly with these companies  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we also compete with emerging companies that are attempting to sell products in specialized markets that our products address 
we compete principally on the basis of the technical innovation and performance of our products  
table of contents including their speed  density  power usage  reliability and specialty packaging alternatives  as well as on price and product availability 
we are experiencing significant price competition in our nonvolatile memory business and especially for eprom and flash products 
we expect continuing competitive pressures in our markets from existing competitors and new entrants  which  among other things  will likely maintain the recent trend of declining average selling prices for our products 
in addition to the factors described above  our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including the following our success in designing and manufacturing new products that implement new technologies and processes our ability to offer integrated solutions using our advanced nonvolatile memory process with other technologies the rate at which customers incorporate our products into their systems product introductions by our competitors the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and general market and economic conditions 
many of these factors are outside of our control  and we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
we must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive 
the average selling prices of our products historically have decreased over the products lives and are expected to continue to do so 
as a result  our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products which compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address customer requirements 
we are continually designing and commercializing new and improved products to maintain our competitive position 
these new products typically are more technologically complex than their predecessors  and thus have increased potential for delays in their introduction 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion and introduction of new product designs  achievement of acceptable fabrication yields and market acceptance 
our development of new products and our customers decision to design them into their systems can take as long as three years  depending upon the complexity of the device and the application 
accordingly  new product development requires a long term forecast of market trends and customer needs  and the successful introduction of our products may be adversely affected by competing products or by technologies serving the markets addressed by our products 
our qualification process involves multiple cycles of testing and improving a product s functionality to ensure that our products operate in accordance with design specifications 
if we experience delays in the introduction of new products  our future operating results could be harmed 
in addition  new product introductions frequently depend on our development and implementation of new process technologies  and our future growth will depend in part upon the successful development and market acceptance of these process technologies 
our integrated solution products require more technically sophisticated sales and marketing personnel to market these products successfully to customers 
we are developing new products with smaller feature sizes  the fabrication of which will be substantially more complex than fabrication of our current products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture  market and sell new products successfully  our operating results will be harmed 
our new product development  process development  or marketing and sales efforts may not be successful  our new products may not achieve market acceptance  and price expectations for our new products may not be achieved  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents our operations and financial results could be harmed by natural disasters or terrorist acts 
since the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon  certain insurance coverage has either been reduced or made subject to additional conditions by our insurance carriers  and we have not been able to maintain all necessary insurance coverage at reasonable cost 
instead  we have relied to a greater degree on self insurance 
for example  we now cover the expense of property loss up to million per event 
our headquarters  some manufacturing facilities and some of our major vendors and customers facilities are located near major earthquake faults and in potential terrorist target areas 
if a major earthquake or other disaster or a terrorist act impacts us and insurance coverage is unavailable for any reason  we may need to spend significant amounts to repair or replace our facilities and equipment  we may suffer a temporary halt in our ability to transport product and we could suffer damages of an amount sufficient to harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results are highly dependent on our international sales and operations  which exposes us to various political and economic risks 
sales to customers outside north america accounted for approximately   and of net revenues in   and we expect that revenues derived from international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenues 
international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks  including greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations reduced flexibility and increased cost of staffing adjustments  particularly in france and germany greater risk of uncollectible accounts longer collection cycles potential unexpected changes in regulatory practices  including export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws sales seasonality  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
further  we purchase a significant portion of our raw materials and equipment from foreign suppliers  and we incur labor and other operating costs in foreign currencies  particularly at our french  german and uk manufacturing facilities 
as a result  our costs will fluctuate along with the currencies and general economic conditions in the countries in which we do business  which could harm our operating results 
approximately   and of our net revenues in   and were denominated in us dollars 
during these periods our products became less price competitive in countries with currencies declining in value against the dollar 
in  business conditions in asia were severely affected by banking and currency issues that adversely affected our operating results 
approximately   and of net revenues were generated in asia in  and when we take foreign orders denominated in local currencies  we risk receiving fewer dollars when these currencies weaken against the dollar  and may not be able to adequately hedge against this risk 
when we take a foreign order denominated in a local currency we will receive fewer dollars than initially anticipated if that local currency weakens against the dollar before we collect our funds 
in addition to reducing revenues  this risk will negatively affect our operating results 
in europe  where our significant operations have costs denominated in european currencies  these negative impacts on revenues can be partially offset by positive 
table of contents impacts on costs 
however  in japan  while our yen denominated sales are also subject to exchange rate risk  we do not have significant operations with which to counterbalance our exposure 
sales denominated in european currencies and yen as a percentage of net revenues were and in  and in  and and in  respectively 
we also face the risk that our accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
problems that we experience with key customers or distributors may harm our business 
our ability to maintain close  satisfactory relationships with large customers is important to our business 
a reduction  delay  or cancellation of orders from our large customers would harm our business 
the loss of one or more of our key customers  or reduced orders by any of our key customers  could harm our business and results of operations 
moreover  our customers may vary order levels significantly from period to period  and customers may not continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in prior periods 
we sell many of our products through distributors 
our distributors could experience financial difficulties or otherwise reduce or discontinue sales of our products 
our distributors could commence or increase sales of our competitors products 
in any of these cases  our business could be harmed 
we are not protected by long term contracts with our customers 
we do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers  and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contract  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer 
in the event of an early termination by one of our major customers  it is unlikely that we will be able to rapidly replace that revenue source  which would harm our financial results 
our failure to successfully integrate businesses or products we have acquired could disrupt or harm our ongoing business 
we have from time to time acquired  and may in the future acquire additional  complementary businesses  products and technologies 
achieving the anticipated benefits of an acquisition depends  in part  upon whether the integration of the acquired business  products or technology is accomplished in an efficient and effective manner 
moreover  successful acquisitions in the semiconductor industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries because such acquisitions require  among other things  integration of product offerings  manufacturing operations and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
the difficulties of such integration may be increased by the need to coordinate geographically separated organizations  the complexity of the technologies being integrated  and the necessity of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining two different corporate cultures 
the integration of operations following an acquisition requires the dedication of management resources that may distract attention from the day to day business  and may disrupt key research and development  marketing or sales efforts 
the inability of management to successfully integrate any future acquisition could harm our business 
furthermore  products acquired in connection with acquisitions may not gain acceptance in our markets  and we may not achieve the anticipated or desired benefits of such transactions 
we may face third party intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in loss of significant rights 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which on occasion have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
we have from time to time received  and may in the future receive  communications from third parties asserting patent or other intellectual property rights covering our products or processes 
in the past  we have received specific allegations from major companies alleging that certain of our products infringe patents owned by such companies 
in order to avoid the significant costs associated with our defense in litigation involving such claims  we may license the use of the technologies that are the subject of these claims from such companies and be required to make corresponding royalty payments  which may harm our operating results 
we have in the past been involved in intellectual property infringement lawsuits  which harmed our operating results and are currently involved in intellectual property infringement lawsuits which may harm our 
table of contents future operating results 
although we intend to vigorously defend against any such lawsuits  we may not prevail given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent and intellectual property litigation 
moreover  the cost of defending against such litigation  in terms of management time and attention  legal fees and product delays  could be substantial  whatever the outcome 
if any patent or other intellectual property claims against us are successful  we may be prohibited from using the technologies subject to these claims  and if we are unable to obtain a license on acceptable terms  license a substitute technology  or design new technology to avoid infringement  our business and operating results may be significantly harmed 
we have several cross license agreements with other companies 
in the future  it may be necessary or advantageous for us to obtain additional patent licenses from existing or other parties  but these license agreements may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
we depend on independent assembly contractors which may not have adequate capacity to fulfill our needs and which may not meet our quality and delivery objectives 
we manufacture wafers for our products at our fabrication facilities  and the wafers are then sorted and tested at our facilities 
after wafer testing  we ship the wafers to one of our independent assembly contractors located in china  hong kong  indonesia  japan  malaysia  the philippines  south korea  taiwan or thailand where the wafers are separated into die  packaged and  in some cases  tested 
our reliance on independent contractors to assemble  package and test our products involves significant risks  including reduced control over quality and delivery schedules  the potential lack of adequate capacity and discontinuance or phase out of the contractors assembly processes 
these independent contractors may not continue to assemble  package and test our products for a variety of reasons 
moreover  because our assembly contractors are located in foreign countries  we are subject to certain risks generally associated with contracting with foreign suppliers  including currency exchange fluctuations  political and economic instability  trade restrictions and changes in tariff and freight rates 
accordingly  we may experience problems in timelines and the adequacy or quality of product deliveries  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are subject to environmental regulations  which could impose unanticipated requirements on our business in the future 
any failure to comply with current or future environmental regulations may subject us to liability or suspension of our manufacturing operations 
we are subject to a variety of international  federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
increasing public attention has been focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor operations 
although we have not experienced any material adverse effect on our operations from environmental regulations  any changes in such regulations or in their enforcement may impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements 
if for any reason we fail to control the use of  or to restrict adequately the discharge of  hazardous substances under present or future regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability or our manufacturing operations could be suspended 
we depend on certain key personnel  and the loss of any key personnel may seriously harm our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly those highly skilled design  process and test engineers involved in the manufacture of existing products and in the development of new products and processes 
the competition for such personnel is intense  and the loss of key employees  none of whom is subject to an employment agreement for a specified term or a post employment non competition agreement  could harm our business 
business interruptions could harm our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
in addition  business interruption insurance may not be enough to compensate us for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of business interruptions could significantly harm our business 

table of contents system integration disruptions could harm our business 
we are currently making enhancements to our integrated financial and supply chain management system and transitioning some of our operational procedures at the same time 
this transition process is complex  time consuming and expensive 
operational disruptions during the course of this transition process or delays in the implementation of this new system could adversely impact our operations 
our ability to forecast sales demand  ship products  manage our product inventory and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired during the transition period 
provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and preferred shares rights agreement may have anti takeover effects 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  voting rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions of those shares without the approval of our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  by making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our stock 
in addition  the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
we also have a preferred shares rights agreement with equiserve trust company  na  as rights agent  dated as of september   amended and restated on october  and amended as of november   which gives our stockholders certain rights that would likely delay  defer or prevent a change of control of atmel in a transaction not approved by our board of directors 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by factors such as the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  technological innovations by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our results of operations  changes in earnings estimates by market analysts and general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries 
statements or changes in opinions  ratings  or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to the market in which we do business or relating to us specifically could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many high technology companies  often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities whose values are dependent upon short term interest rates 
we generally classify these securities as available for sale  and consequently record them on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses being recorded as a separate part of stockholders equity 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
given our current profile of interest rate exposures and the maturities of its investment holdings  we believe that an unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a significant negative impact on our investment portfolio or statement of operations through december  in addition  some of our borrowings are at floating rates  so this would act as a natural hedge 
we have short term debt  long term debt  capital leases and convertible notes totaling approximately million at december  approximately million of these borrowings have fixed interest rates 
we have approximately million of floating interest rate debt of which million is euro denominated 
we do not hedge against this interest rate risk and could be negatively affected should either of these rates increase significantly 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million adverse impact on income before taxes on our consolidated statements of operations for while there can be no assurance that both of these rates will remain at current levels  we believe that any rate increase will not cause significant negative impact to our operations and to our financial position 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in interest expense related to our outstanding borrowings for the year ending december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

table of contents foreign currency risk when we take a foreign order denominated in a local currency we will receive fewer dollars than we initially anticipated if that local currency weakens against the dollar before we collect our funds  which will reduce revenue 
conversely  revenues will be positively impacted if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
in europe  where our significant operations have costs denominated in european currencies  costs will decrease if the local currency weakens 
conversely  costs will increase if the local currency strengthens against the dollar 
in  the impact of the change in foreign currency represents of net loss as discussed in the overview section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this impact is determined assuming that all foreign denominated transactions that occurred in were recorded using the average foreign currency rates 
sales denominated in foreign currencies were  and in  and  respectively 
sales denominated in euros were   and in  and respectively 
sales denominated in yen were  and in  and respectively 
costs denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro  were approximately in and in and we also face the risk that our accounts receivables denominated in foreign currencies will be devalued if such foreign currencies weaken quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately  and of our accounts receivable are denominated in foreign currency as of december  and respectively 
we also face the risk that our accounts payable and debt obligations denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar 
approximately  and of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
approximately  and of our debt obligations were denominated in foreign currency as of december  and  respectively 
in  we plan to implement a hedging program to reduce our risk and to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we anticipate using derivative instruments to manage foreign currency cash flows  and asset and liability exposures 
we will not enter into foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes
