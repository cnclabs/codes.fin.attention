approximately of the company s consolidated sales were produced in the united kingdom by the company s united kingdom subsidiaries 
the average exchange rate during was to  compared to to during as a result of this increase in the value of the british pound in  the company reported million more in sales during than it would have reported had the exchange rate remained constant at the average 
the united kingdom subsidiaries purchases are mostly denominated in british pounds as well  resulting in a similar impact on the company s expenses in due to the increase in the value of the british pound 
for the year ended december   consolidated sales increased by million  to million from million in atm sales increased by million in as compared to  while photocopy sales decreased by million and software development sales decreased by million as compared to the company s atm business derives revenues from operating atm machines and  beginning in late  from sales of atm machines 
also  in late  the company began servicing equipment  including atms  for others 
servicing revenue for  which was not significant  is included in atm revenues 
atm gross revenues were million in compared to million in the million increase in atm revenues is a combination of an million increase in revenues from atm operations and million in sales of atm machines in sales of atm machines were not significant in the million increase in revenues from atm operations is a result of an expansion of the company s atm network  higher pricing and the increased value of the british pound 
in the month of december the company had  transacting atms  compared to  in december  an increase of atms 
the average number of transacting atms during increased by compared to withdrawal transactions per unit remained nearly constant  but the average gross revenue generated per withdrawal transaction increased by  to in from in the increase in gross revenue per transaction resulted from increases in the withdrawal fee per transaction on a substantial portion of the company s atm machines starting in the second half of and continuing into and the increased value of the british pound 
million of the increase in atm gross revenues in as compared to is a result of the increase in the value of the british pound 
photocopy sales in were million compared to million in the million decrease in photocopy sales resulted from a decline in copy volume offset in large part by price increases and the increased value of the british pound 
continuing the recent trend  copy volume declined by million copies in  to million copies in from million copies in the decrease in copy volume is a combination of a decline in installed copiers to an average of  in from  in and a reduction of copies made per unit to  in from  in the company believes that the decrease in average copies per unit is attributable primarily to a decline in demand caused by advances in electronic media and increasing availability of printers and copiers in the home 
the company has responded to this decrease by eliminating certain lower volume  unprofitable photocopy locations  and increasing prices 
the average gross sales price per copy increased to 
in from 
in as a result of the company s work with its retailers to implement price increases throughout most of its photocopy locations 
the company has selected target prices for its photocopier locations in each country where it has photocopiers 
at the end of  of the company s photocopy locations were at or above the target prices  compared to that were at or above these same target prices at the end of gross sales per average installed unit increased to  in from  in  as price increases and the increased value of the british pound more than offset the reduction in copies made per unit 
the company s photocopy segment reported approximately  more in gross revenues in than it would have reported had the exchange rate for the british pound remained at the average 
software development revenues decreased to million in from million in the decrease resulted from substantial completion of a development contract with ncr corporation during the first quarter of sales discounts are the portion of revenue retained by the owners of sites where the company s atm machines and copiers are located 
the discounts are based on revenues generated or transaction volumes 
sales discounts on a consolidated basis as a percentage of sales excluding sales of atm machines and software development revenues were in compared to in sales discounts in the atm business increased to of sales excluding sales of atm machines from in this increase in discounts occurred in the united kingdom and was caused by an increase in the percentage of retail partners who provide their own cash in their atms eliminating the company s need to provide cash for those atms  and who therefore receive a higher share of the revenues 
atm discounts as a percent of the related revenue declined slightly in the united states in to from in sales discounts in the photocopy business decreased slightly in  to of sales from in this decrease is due to movement of photocopy site owners to lower discount scales as their photocopy volume declined 
cost of sales on a consolidated basis increased by million in  but as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in cost of sales in the atm business increased by million  to million in from million in  as a result of increased sales volume  the sale of atm machines in and the increased value of the british pound 
the company s atm segment reported approximately  more in cost of sales in then it would have reported had the exchange rate for the british pound remained at the average 
cost of sales from the company s atm operations excluding the sales and cost of sales of atm machines declined to of sales from in this percentage decrease resulted from increases in revenue per transaction in addition to a decrease in per transaction cost due primarily to renegotiation of certain processing contracts 
excluding the cost of atm machines sold and related commissions  cost of sales in the atm business decreased to per transaction in  compared to per transaction in cost of sales in the photocopy business decreased by million in  due primarily to the decrease in copy volume 
directly related to the reductions in photocopy volume  the cost of paper declined by  and labor included in photocopy cost of sales decreased by  in addition  the cost of scrapped and obsolete materials decreased by  following aggressive inventory management in on a per copy basis  photocopy cost of sales increased  to cents in from cents in the company s photocopy segment reported approximately  more in cost of sales in than it would have reported had the exchange rate for the british pound remained at the average 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased by million  to million in from million in this reduction in expenses is almost entirely due to a reduction in labor cost 
at the beginning of the third quarter  the company determined that it was overstaffed for current business demands and  in combination with a number of other cost saving measures  began a reduction in force throughout its operations 
the united states reduction in force took place primarily in the second half of  the united kingdom reduction in force took place in the first quarter of the decrease in labor was partially offset by a  increase in selling general and administrative costs of the company s united kingdom subsidiaries as a result of the increased value of the british pound in as compared to asset retirements totaled  in and  in in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that certain of its mita analog photocopiers held in storage would not likely be returned to service  and  representing the net book value of these copiers was charged to expense 
in conjunction with the company s commitment to purchase an additional konica photocopy machines during  year over year declines in photocopy transaction volumes  and limited opportunities for large scale expansion  the company determined that the market no longer supported plans to redeploy older technology photocopiers 
instead  the company intends to manage the photocopy business by controlling growth in new and existing markets  leveraging its newer technology photocopiers and heightening profitability requirements 
during the company wrote off additional equipment with a net book value of  mostly additional older technology copiers that had been taken out of service and are not likely to be returned to service 
the combination of a million increase in gross profit and reductions of million in selling  general and administrative expenses and million in asset retirements resulted in an increase in the company s operating income to million  compared to an operating loss of million in interest expense declined to  in  from  in  a decrease 
the decrease in interest expense is attributable primarily to a decrease in interest bearing obligations 
long term debt and capital leases aggregated  at december   a decrease from the  balance at the end of lower interest rates on the company s long term debt as a result of the new loan agreement entered into in may also contributed to the decrease in interest expense 
the interest rate on the company s borrowings from bank of america decreased to at december   compared to at december  other income was  in compared to  of other expense in the expense was primarily the result of recognition of a million legal liability recorded subsequent to reaching a proposed settlement in the paulsell litigation as more fully described in item of this report 
the company s effective tax rate for was  resulting in a provision for income taxes of  compared to an effective rate of and an income tax benefit of  in the change in the effective tax rate for as compared to is due primarily to the fact that the profits in the united kingdom have increased as a percentage of the total company profits 
since the company has elected to use the indefinite reinvestment criteria  local jurisdictional rates are used in computing the company s tax provision 
the company s net income for was million  compared to a net loss of million in the million improvement in operating income in and reductions in interest and other expense combined to improve income from continuing operations before income taxes by million 
after taxes  the company s income from continuing operations was million in  compared to a loss of million in the net loss of million for includes  in losses from the discontinued operations of iatmglobal 
net prior to its disposal in february year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated sales increased by million to million from million for revenues from the company s atm business increased to million during from million in the company experienced this significant increase in atm revenues due to increases in the company s base of installed atm units of approximately on a consolidated basis and an asset management strategy that included moving atms from low transaction volume sites to higher volume sites 
withdrawal transactions per unit decreased to  in from  in  a decrease of 
however  overall withdrawal transactions increased to million from million in withdrawal revenue per unit increased to  in from  in the increase in revenue per unit is a result of increasing the withdrawal fee per transaction on a portion of the company s atm installed base during the second half of photocopy sales were down by million in as compared to this decrease was primarily a result of an overall decrease in total copy volume of million transactions from the prior year reflecting the mature nature of the photocopy business 
total copy volume for the fiscal year ended december  was million copies as compared to billion copies for the same period in  a decline of 
the average number of installed copiers in was  down from  in the average number of copies made per installed copier declined slightly  to  in  from  in management believes that active asset management designed to remove photocopiers from lower volume sites and to re deploy those machines into higher volume sites offset a decline in demand for copy services 
sales discounts are greater in the photocopy business than in the atm business and generally vary at individual retail businesses depending on volume the higher the volume  the greater the discount 
sales discounts as a percentage of sales in were as compared to in the increase as a percentage of sales is primarily due to a shift in the atm business toward higher discount programs that allow retailers to retain a larger portion of the revenue in exchange for providing their own cash 
in  the sales discounts related to the atm business were of sales as compared to in photocopy sales discounts were of photocopy sales in and cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in on a consolidated basis 
cost of sales in the atm business decreased as a percentage of atm revenue to in from in while atm revenues increased by million in compared to  cost of sales increased by only million 
the increase in the volume of withdrawal transactions resulted in an economy of scale that reduced the cost of sales per withdrawal transaction to in from in per transaction costs were reduced primarily in two areas 
third party service and maintenance costs were reduced by 
per transaction  offset partially by the cost of bringing certain maintenance in house 
cost of cash in the atm machines decreased by 
per transaction as a result of lower transaction fees from the trust as more fully described in liquidity and capital resources 
due to the percentage of overall revenue and associated costs of sales in contributed by the atm business  and respectively  significant changes in the atm business will not be realized in consolidated results until the atm business becomes a larger portion of the overall business 
cost of sales associated with the photocopy business increased to of contributed revenue from in while labor included in cost of sales in the photocopy business declined   revenue declined  resulting in an increase in labor as a percentage of sales to from of contributed revenue in compared to materials related costs in the photocopy business in included an increase in scrapped and obsolete materials of  compared to  of which  is recorded as an allowance for obsolete inventory 
the total materials related cost of sales in the photocopy business remained constant at of contributed revenue for and the company does not anticipate that expenses for scrapped and obsolete materials will be significant going forward as inventory levels were reduced worldwide in as a result of aggressive inventory and cost management 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue on a consolidated basis decreased to from in the decrease in these costs as a percentage of sales relates primarily to the disposal of iatmglobal 
net in february iatmglobal 
net had contributed million to selling  general  and administrative costs in which represented of contributed revenue 
the software development portion of the business that was retained by the company contributed million or of contributed revenue in the decrease in selling  general  and administrative costs associated with iatmglobal 
net was partially offset by a million increase in non labor related expenses in the company s other businesses 
these include a  increase in expense for value added tax vat in the united kingdom atm business 
of this amount  approximately  had been capitalized since the inception of the atm business and  had been recorded as vat receivable in that was subsequently determined to be non reclaimable 
the remainder was vat expense related to fiscal year in the company received a final determination from uk taxing authorities as to the applicability and method of calculating vat associated with its atm business which resulted in the need to record additional expense 
prior to  the treatment of vat related to the atm business could not be reasonably determined or estimated since non bank atm placements were relatively new to the united kingdom and the taxing authority had not yet provided guidance as to their tax treatment 
an additional  related to non recurring expense was recorded in anticipation of renewing the company s fleet leases earlier than originally planned 
other increases included insurance premiums  legal fees  and travel expenses 
the company believes that these increases are commensurate with overall market trends in the insurance industry  as well as the litigation that was in the settlement process at the time 
at the beginning of the third quarter  the company determined that it was overstaffed for current business demands and  in combination with a number of other cost saving measures  began a reduction in force throughout its operations 
the united states reduction in force took place primarily in the second half of  the united kingdom reduction in force took place in first quarter of due to the timing of this action as well as cost associated with severance payments  full cost savings from these actions were not realized in in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that certain of its mita analog photocopiers held in storage would not likely be returned to service  and  representing the net book value of these copiers was charged to expense 
in conjunction with the company s commitment to purchase an additional konica photocopy machines during  year over year declines in photocopy transaction volumes  and limited opportunities for large scale expansion  the company determined that the market no longer supported plans to redeploy older technology photocopiers 
interest expense decreased as percentage of sales to in compared to in beginning and ending borrowings on the company s revolving line of credit for fiscal years and were million and million  and million and million  respectively 
the company s average outstanding balances on its line of credit were million in and million in  reflecting a decrease in the average outstanding balance of million during borrowings on the company s line of credit during the fiscal year ended december  fell from million to million  a decrease of million 
interest rates during the same period decreased from to on the outstanding amount 
the company entered into capital leases on equipment in and interest expense related to these capital leases for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
as such  in fiscal year  the decline in both the line of credit outstanding balance and interest rates  offset partially by an increase in capital lease interest  resulted in an overall reduced interest expense compared to fiscal year in october the company incurred a million loss on the disposal of the assets of its french operation 
other expense was  in compared to  of other income in the expense was primarily the result of recognition of a million legal liability recorded subsequent to reaching a proposed settlement in the paulsell litigation as more fully described in item although the company s gross profit improved in compared to  the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  asset retirements and other expense resulted in an increase in the loss from continuing operations before minority interest 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  resulting in an income tax benefit of  compared to an effective rate of an expense in the change in the effective tax rate for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to the valuation allowance recorded in related to the company s foreign net operating losses and to the write off of net operating losses in as a result of amended tax returns for which credits will not be obtained 
the company s loss from continuing operations increased by  to  in from  in the increase was due primarily to the increase in other expense  mostly offset by the increased income tax benefit 
losses from discontinued operations are the results of operations of iatmglobal 
net prior to its disposal in february loss from discontinued operations decreased to  in from  in because the company owned iatmglobal 
net for only months in and for the entire year in the company s net loss on a consolidated basis decreased million to million in from million in an increase of  in operating loss was combined with a  increase in interest and other expenses

the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer bad debts  inventories  equipment  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
trm s use of the units of production method of depreciation for its konica model and model photocopier assets requires the use of estimates related to the useful life of such assets 
trm has determined that the useful life of these assets is an average of  copies per machine 
at december   konica copiers are carried on the company s books at a cost of million  less accumulated depreciation of million 
if actual copies produced differ significantly from the estimated useful life at the time of asset disposal  further write downs equal to the remaining carrying value may be required 
if future losses on disposal or significant decreases in the annual copy volume of this class of photocopiers becomes evidence of a shorter useful life than originally estimated  a change in accounting estimate relating to depreciable life may be required  resulting in additional depreciation charges on a prospective basis 
trm maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of trm s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
trm maintains reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  such as signage  equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company is self insured  with re insurance  for purposes of providing medical insurance benefits to its employees 
the company records estimated reserves after consideration of historical trends  known or reasonably estimated expenses  and aggregate stop loss coverages provided by its re insurance carrier 
should actual expenses be greater than estimated  additional expense related to medical insurance claims may be recorded 
trm holds a minority interest in a french corporation which is not publicly traded and whose value is difficult to determine 
the french corporation has operations or technology in areas within or adjacent to trm s strategic focus 
trm records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
although the company has not reported a related charge to date  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the company s investment in the french corporation could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in its current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
trm records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while trm has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event trm was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should trm determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
trm records an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of its financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements  and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   the company does not have any liability recorded for loss contingencies 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to any pending litigation and may revise its estimates 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability may materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position
