item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we generate our revenues through the sale of more than  products and services to the global scientific research and us clinical laboratory markets 
we generated approximately of our revenues from the sale of consumable products 
we offer both proprietary products and products that we source from more than  vendors 
our proprietary products consist of fisher branded products and products for which we serve as an exclusive distributor 
we offer and sell our products and services to over  customers located in approximately countries 
our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  colleges and universities  medical research institutions  hospitals and reference labs  and quality control  process control and research and development laboratories 
our largest customer accounted for less than of our sales 
our key strategy is to continue to increase our proprietary products and service offerings  both organically and through acquisitions  thereby enhancing our operating margins and increasing our earnings growth 
as part of executing our strategy we have steadily increased the portion of sales generated from our higher margin proprietary products  from in to approximately in we plan to continue to focus on increasing the breadth of our portfolio of proprietary products and services  we have enhanced our international capabilities  such that our sales outside the united states have increased from of our sales in to in in addition  our earnings have improved reflecting continued margin improvement on international sales 
we expect these trends to continue  and we have enhanced our focus in the higher growth life sciences sector of the scientific research market 
it is our intention to continue to focus on the high growth life sciences sector in the future 
we have implemented this strategy through continued investments in internal resources and strategic acquisitions 
in september  we acquired perbio  a manufacturer of consumable tools for protein related research and protein based biopharma drug production  primarily to customers within the united states 
in november  we acquired cole parmer  a manufacturer and distributor of specialty technical instruments  appliances  equipment and supplies 
we acquired fisher clinical services fcs in february  a company that enables pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers to outsource the packaging  labeling and distribution of new medicines undergoing phase iii and phase iv clinical trials 
more recently  we acquired oxoid and signed a definitive agreement to acquire dhamacon 
oxoid manufactures microbiological culture media and other diagnostic products that test for bacterial contamination 
dharmacon is a manufacturer of rna tools used in life science research that increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process 
these acquisitions will expand our life sciences footprint and position us to offer our customers products and services across the life sciences spectrum 
acquired companies accounted for approximately of the increase in our sales in and in a portion of the increase in sales will be generated by a full year of perbio results and approximately three quarters of results for oxoid and dharmacon 
we undertook a number of financing transactions in and to extend the maturity of our long term debt  take advantage of favorable interest rates to reduce our borrowing costs and finance our acquisitions discussed above 
additionally  a year ago  thomas h 
lee company and certain affiliates the equity investors owned  on a diluted basis  of our issued and outstanding common stock 
during the year  the equity investors made distributions of their holdings eliminating any remaining ownership of our outstanding common stock 

table of contents during  we changed our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage our business and now report financial results on the basis of the following three reportable segments scientific products and services segment  which provides products and services used for scientific research  drug discovery and drug development applications on a global basis 
this segment manufactures and distributes a broad range of consumable supplies  scientific instruments and apparatus and safety products 
in addition  this segment provides pharmaceutical services for clinical trials  customer chemical synthesis  contract manufacturing and a number of other value added services 
healthcare products and services segment  which manufactures and distributes a wide array of diagnostic kits and reagents  consumable supplies and medical devices to hospitals  clinical laboratories and physicians offices located in the us additionally  this segment provides outsourced manufacturing services for diagnostic reagents  calibrators and controls to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries 
laboratory workstations segment  which manufactures and sells laboratory furniture and fume hoods and provides lab design services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers  colleges  universities and secondary schools  hospitals and reference labs

acquisitions accounted for approximately and  respectively  of the and sales growth rates 
our organic growth rate for and remained constant at approximately 
in  our organic growth rate was impacted by an increase in demand for certain clinical laboratory products  as well as safety related products  offset by mixed results among our pharmaceutical customers and a decline in sales to us biotechnology customers and in certain international markets  primarily france and germany 
in  the organic sales growth rate increased approximately and was primarily driven by normal market conditions 
scientific products and services 
the and sales growth rates are favorably impacted by foreign exchange translation of million and million  respectively 
acquisitions accounted for approximately and  respectively  of and sales growth rates 
the effect of acquisitions is primarily attributable to perbio s cell culture and bioresearch divisions 
the effect of acquisitions is primarily attributable to our acquisition of cole parmer 
our organic growth rate decreased approximately from approximately in our organic growth rate was impacted by an increase in demand for safety related products  offset by a decline in sales to our us biotechnology customers  mixed results among pharmaceutical customers and a slowdown in international sale due to weakness in the european economy and reductions in research funding from governments 
the change in our organic growth rate in was primarily attributable to normal market conditions in the us  offset by a decline in international sales  primarily due to our strategy to focus on the sale of higher margin products 

table of contents healthcare products and services 
sales growth in was primarily due to an increase in demand for clinical laboratory products and the acquisition of the perbio medical devices business 
sales growth was spread evenly between hospitals and reference labs 
in  sales growth was attributable to growth in the us clinical laboratory market and the acquisition of medical analysis systems  inc mas 
the effect of foreign exchange is not significant to our healthcare products and services segment as sales are primarily to customers within the us laboratory workstations 
sales in and were million and million  respectively 
this represents an increase of and  respectively  versus the prior year s sales 
the decrease in the sales growth rate for was primarily attributable to a million transportation safety authority tsa project awarded and substantially completed in  that was not anticipated to repeat in the increase in the sales growth rate was attributable to the tsa project 
laboratory workstations is a project based business which operates from a backlog  a majority of which may be shipped in less than one year 
delivery and installation of projects  which are driven by the timing of construction projects  results in a corresponding reduction in backlog 
backlog at december  was million versus million at december  income from operations the following table presents income from operations and income from operations as a percentage of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december   and dollars in millions income from operations as a income from operations percentage of sales scientific products and services healthcare products and services laboratory workstations eliminations sub total inventory step up restructuring and other charges credits  net nonrecurring operating charges goodwill amortization total included in the income from operations is a charge of million related to the step up of perbio s inventory to its acquired fair value 
excluding this charge  income from operations was of sales 
included in the income from operations is a restructuring credit of million for the reversal of certain costs accrued for in a restructuring plan entered into in the restructuring credit is primarily related to a reduction in estimated severance costs due to the election of certain employees to voluntarily separate from the company 
excluding the restructuring credit  income from operations was of sales 
the increase in income from operations as a percentage of sales is attributable to our acquisition of perbio  as well as our clinical laboratory product portfolio that was partially offset by investments in life science and chemical sales specialists  targeted marketing programs and continued investments in business processes and systems 
included in the income from operations are the following items a restructuring charge of million  reflecting million related to estimated employee separation costs and million of exit costs  a restructuring credit of million for the reversal of certain costs accrued for restructuring plans recorded prior to  due to actual costs being lower than originally estimated

scientific products and services 
the increase in income from operations as a percentage of sales in was attributable to the impact of the perbio acquisition  continued improvements in international operating margins  partially offset by a decrease in volume to us biotechnology companies and increased investments in sales and marketing initiatives 
the increase in operating margins was primarily attributable to our acquisition of cole parmer and an increase in international operating margins 
we expect a trend of continued operating margin improvement for  reflecting the contribution of perbio s cell culture and bioresearch businesses  as well as organic fixed cost leverage and margin improvement from initiatives both domestic and international 
healthcare products and services 
the increase in income from operations as a percentage of sales in was reflective of a broad based increase in volume for clinical laboratory products 
the decrease in operating margins for was primarily the result of strategic investments in business processes and systems 
we expect operating margin improvement for  reflecting the impact of the higher margin medical device business of perbio 
laboratory workstations 
the decrease in income from operations as a percentage of sales in was the result of the higher margin tsa project completed in that did not repeat in conversely  the tsa project was primarily attributable for the increase in operating margins in we anticipate operating margins will decrease in  more significantly in the first half of the year  reflecting the timing of projects 
interest expense interest expense in   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense is attributable to our debt refinancing activities in and the benefits of these transactions were partially offset by million in bridge financing commitment fees incurred related to our acquisition financing for perbio

table of contents income tax provision our effective tax rate was  down from in as a result of our ongoing implementation of tax planning initiatives 
our effective tax rate benefited by the charges we recorded related to our debt refinancings  and the charges related to perbio resulting in a tax provision of 
our effective tax rate was  down from in due to the implementation of tax planning initiatives  the elimination of non deductible goodwill amortization and the impact of the restructuring and stock compensation charges 
cumulative effect of accounting change during  we completed our transitional assessment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas to determine if goodwill was impaired as of january  as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million million  net of tax in our statement of operations reflecting the cumulative effect of the accounting change to adjust goodwill to its current fair value 
the scientific products and services segment and laboratory workstations segment accounted for million and million of the charge  respectively 
the impairment charge in the scientific products and services segment related to certain of our smaller market international distribution businesses where operating performance was lower than originally forecasted 
our laboratory workstations segment is sensitive to changes in capital spending  and several of the markets to which the laboratory workstations segment sells  including the technology industry  experienced a significant economic slowdown causing a reduction in capital spending in those markets 
as a result  sales growth was significantly less than originally forecasted  resulting in decreased profitability 
sfas also requires that goodwill be tested annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform the annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of october each year 
as of october  and  there were no impairments of goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources cash generated from operating activities was million in compared with million in the increase in cash from operations in was related primarily to an increase in net income and continued improvements in working capital management  partially offset by approximately million in contributions to our pension plan and supplemental nonqualified executive retirement program 
cash generated from operating activities was million in compared with million in the increase in net income in was offset by million in cash pension contributions and million of spending related to our restructuring plans 
in  we anticipate an increase in net income and continued improvements in working capital management to improve cash generated from operating activities 
we used million of cash for investing activities in compared with million in the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to the acquisition of perbio and continued capital spending for our chemical manufacturing capabilities  our new west coast warehouse that opened late in and spending associated with perbio facility expansions 
in addition  we paid million to purchase options to hedge foreign currency exposures related to the perbio acquisition 
we used million of cash for investing activities in compared with million in the change in cash used for investing activities from to is primarily attributable to a decrease in acquisition spending 
we expect capital spending to be consistent with financing activities generated million of cash in compared with using million of cash in and are discussed below
