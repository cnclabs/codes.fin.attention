item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under certain factors that may affect our future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide software and related services that allow our clients to more effectively manage their contract based  business to business relationships through the entirety of the contract management lifecycle 
we operate our business in two segments health and life sciences and other industries 
the health and life sciences line of business markets and sells our products and services to companies in the life sciences industries  including pharmaceutical and medical product companies  wholesale distributors and managed care organizations 
our other industries line of business targets all other industries  with an emphasis on consumer products  foodservice  disposables  consumer durables  industrial products  chemicals  apparel  and telecommunications 
our primary products and services were originally developed to manage complex contract purchasing relationships in the healthcare industry 
our software is currently licensed by of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers  ranked according to annual healthcare revenues 
as the depth and breadth of our product suites have expanded  we have added companies in the other industries markets to our customer base 
in july  we announced an agreement  subject to shareholder approval  to sell our health and life sciences line of business to neoforma  inc neoforma 
this agreement was terminated in december in preparing for the sale  we restructured our organization and  as a result  developed a more efficient cost structure entering into as part of this restructuring  we have reduced our total employee headcount by more than staff positions since june  we have generated revenues from both products and services 
product revenues which through mid had been principally comprised of software license fees generated from our i many cars software suite and now includes licensing of our i many contractsphere enterprise contract management product suite  government pricing and medicaid compliance software accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in service revenues include maintenance and support fees directly related to our licensed software products  professional service fees derived from consulting  installation  business analysis and training services related to our software products and hosting fees 
service revenues accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in this decrease in product revenues as a percentage of total revenues reflects a general decrease in product revenues from to  discussed in more detail below 
since june  we have implemented a number of employee headcount reductions  which have been partially offset by employee additions through acquisitions and selective hiring  and we have taken other measures to better align our cost structure with projected revenues 
our aggregate spending on sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses has been reduced from million in the quarter ended june  to million in the quarter ended december  during  actions taken to reduce our operating expenses included the closing of our chicago  illinois office  the significant downsizing of our london  england and portland  maine operations and selective other headcount reductions 
our total employee headcount has decreased from employees at december  to employees at december  page 
table of contents critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
software license revenues are attributable to the addition of new customers and the expansion or renewal of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products and license renewals 
we recognize software license fees upon execution of a signed license agreement and delivery of the software to customers  provided there are no significant post delivery obligations  the payment is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in multiple element arrangements  we allocate the total fee to professional services  training and maintenance and support services based on the fair value of those elements  which is defined as the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
the residual amount is then allocated to the software license fee 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where collection is not deemed probable  we recognize the license fee as payments are received 
service revenues include professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
professional service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if conditions for acceptance exist  professional service revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
for fixed fee professional service contracts  we provide for anticipated losses in the period in which the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  losses incurred on fixed fee contracts have not been significant 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
included in training revenues are registration fees received from participants in our off site user training conferences 
maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is generally twelve months 
when maintenance and support is included in the total license fee  we allocate a portion of the total fee to maintenance and support based upon the price paid by the customer to purchase maintenance and support in the second year 
payments received from customers at the inception of a maintenance period are treated as deferred service revenues and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
payments received from customers in advance of product shipment or revenue recognition are treated as deferred product revenues and recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or when otherwise earned 
substantially all of the amounts included in cost of revenues represent direct costs related to the delivery of professional services  training and maintenance and customer support 
we account for consideration given to a customer or a reseller of our products as a reduction of revenue in certain circumstances 
to the extent that consideration earned by a customer or reseller during a reporting period exceeds revenue earned by the company from the customer or reseller  such excess is reported as sales and marketing expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record provisions for doubtful accounts based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivables  our historical write off experience  the credit worthiness of customers and the economic conditions of the customers industries and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of the company s future provision for doubtful accounts 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
the provisions for doubtful accounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
page 
table of contents acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will not be amortized until their lives are determined to be definite 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  with the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
deferred tax assets a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for temporary differences in the basis of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes and loss carry forwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary items are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
product indemnifications the company s agreements with customers generally include certain provisions for indemnifying the customer against losses  expenses  and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event that our products are found to infringe upon a patent  copyright  trademark  or other proprietary right of a third party 
the agreements generally seek to limit the scope of remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and no claims are outstanding as of december  we do not expect that any significant impact on financial position or the results of operations will result from these indemnification provisions 
recent events on december   we received notice from neoforma that it had terminated its proposed acquisition of the company s health and life sciences business 
neoforma exercised its right to terminate the asset purchase agreement  which the parties entered into on july   after the proposed page 
table of contents acquisition did not close by november  following termination of the proposed neoforma acquisition  we further reduced the size and scope of our operations in portland  maine  by vacating one of our leased facilities and identifying approximately staff positions to be eliminated 
these headcount reductions were in addition to the employee terminations that had been carried out as part of the company s previous restructuring efforts during the second half of  which were implemented in preparation for the closing of the neoforma transaction before the agreement was terminated 
on february   we entered into a merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of pricing analytics  inc pricing analytics  a california corporation located in redwood city  california  which markets software used to evaluate pricing strategies  for a purchase price of million 
in addition  upon achievement of certain revenue milestones through december   the former pricing analytics shareholders will be entitled to additional consideration of up to million  payable in cash or common stock at our election 
the company will assume pricing analytics s liabilities of approximately  and expects to incur transaction costs of approximately  the pricing analytics acquisition will provide the company with technology that will enhance our product offerings to both our pharmaceutical manufacturing clients and its industry solutions clients 
the merger requires i many to pay the purchase price in the form of approximately  shares of its common stock  with resale registration rights 
i many and pricing analytics are currently negotiating an amendment to the merger agreement to replace the payment of stock consideration with cash consideration  and the terms thereof 
we expect this transaction to be closed before the end of april results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   accounting for substantially all of the decrease in net revenues as service revenues had increased by million 
the number of license contracts minimum price of  sold decreased by from to  accounting for the decrease in product revenues 
although the average dollar size of license contracts increased in relative to  approximately million of license fees related to one contract was deferred to future years for revenue recognition purposes 
the net effect of this million revenue deferral was that the change in average deal size from to  as adjusted to reflect the revenue deferral  was not significant 
as a percentage of total net revenues  revenues derived from outside the health and life sciences segment were in  as compared to in and in meanwhile  revenues in the health and life sciences segment were million less than in the reduction in health and life sciences segment revenues is due primarily to a reduced pipeline of sales opportunities in this segment 
we believe this decrease resulted from the ongoing reluctance of our target customers to make information technology expenditures during the recent economic downturn  which has lengthened sales cycles and reduced the number and quality of sales opportunities available to us 
as economic conditions improve and manufacturers begin to increase spending on information technology  which currently appears to be the general but uncertain trend  we anticipate corresponding improvement in demand for our products 
we also believe that the proposed neoforma transaction  which was announced in july and terminated in december  had a negative impact on new product sales into the health and life sciences market for most of the second half of the year  due to perceived uncertainty about the future of these products and their support 
finally  in our new products in the i many contractsphere enterprise contract management product suite remained in development or in early stage releases  which limited our ability to derive revenues from them and hindered our ability to reduce our reliance on our older products 
as a percentage of total net revenues  product revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease in product revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is principally attributable to the reduction in health and life science revenues discussed above 
the million increase in service revenues in was due to a million increase in maintenance and support revenue  which was attributable to a net increase in the page 
table of contents company s fee paying installed customer base  partially offset by a  reduction in professional services revenues 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of payroll and related costs and subcontractor costs for providing professional services and maintenance and support services and  to a lesser extent  amounts due to third parties for royalties related to integrated technology 
historically  cost of product revenues has not been a significant component of total cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a million increase in subcontractor consulting costs  partially offset by a  reduction in travel expenses as compared to approximately million of the increase in subcontractor costs was related to our decisions to outsource support and hosting activities related to certain of the company s products 
much of the balance of the subcontractor cost increase represents the non recurring impact of delayed hiring decisions within the professional services organization that were a consequence of neoforma s planned acquisition of our health and life sciences business segment 
as a percentage of total net revenues  cost of revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is attributable to the decrease in product revenues and corresponding increase in service revenues as percentages of total revenues  and to the increase in subcontractor costs discussed above 
service revenues have typically generated lower margins than product revenues  and we believe that trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions for sales personnel  travel costs  recruiting fees  expenses for trade shows and advertising and public relations expenses 
during  sales and marketing expenses also includes a non cash charge of  related to the value associated with the granting of a common stock warrant to procter gamble 
excluding the non cash warrant charge  sales and marketing expense decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  significant reductions in sales and marketing headcount employees at december  versus at december  combined with a more than percent decrease in commissionable product revenues were the principal reasons for a million decrease in salaries and commission expenses and a  decrease in travel expenses 
as a percentage of total net revenues  sales and marketing expense excluding the non cash warrant charge remained nearly unchanged at in versus in research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs for development personnel and external consulting costs associated with the development and maintenance of our products 
research and development costs  including the costs of developing computer software  are charged to operations as they are incurred 
research and development expenses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  significant reductions in salaries and related costs  attributable to a reduction in development headcount from at december  to at december   were largely offset by a million increase in external consulting costs resulting from a planned increase in the outsourcing of development work to an offshore entity 
as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expense increased significantly to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  page 
table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in our administrative  finance and human resources departments  insurance costs  and legal  accounting and other professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is principally attributable to reductions in salaries  benefits and related costs  resulting from a decrease in administrative headcount from at december  to at december   and an  reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts relative to as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  depreciation 
depreciation expense decreased by  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to computer and related equipment acquired in and becoming fully depreciated in and since the average annual computer equipment additions during the and timeframe approximately million each year were significantly higher than the rate of computer equipment additions in  and  this decrease in depreciation expense is expected to continue into amortization of other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of other acquired intangibles related to our acquisitions amounted to million in the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or  from the amortization of million in this decrease is attributable to the discontinued amortization of acquired intangibles i for intersoft international  inc intersoft  provato  inc provato and ozro  inc 
ozro  pursuant to the full impairment write offs of these assets in december  and ii for chi cor information management  inc chicor and bcl vision ltd 
bcl  pursuant to full impairment write offs in june in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of menerva technologies  inc menerva in march  we allocated million of the total purchase price to in process research and development  which was expensed upon consummation of the acquisition 
this allocation was based on an independent appraisal conducted for the purpose of allocating the initial consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this allocation was attributable to one in process research and development project  which consisted of the development of significant new features and functionality to an existing software product 
menerva had achieved significant technological milestones on this specific project as of the acquisition date  but the project had not reached technological feasibility 
at the time of the acquisition  the project was approximately complete 
the company invested an additional  in the project following acquisition 
the project s development  which progressed in all material respects consistently with the assumptions that the company had used for estimating its fair value  was subsequently completed in may impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in the quarter ended june   we determined that an interim test for impairment to the company s goodwill and other acquired intangible assets was necessary pursuant to the july announcement of the proposed sale of our health and life sciences business to neoforma 
in conjunction with the proposed sale to neoforma  we made plans to reduce our workforce and focus our near term development efforts primarily on our product offerings in the i many contractsphere enterprise contract management product suite 
the consequent de emphasis on the technologies originally acquired in the acquisitions of chicor and bcl and the corresponding reduction in projected sales of the related products had resulted in the determination that future cash flows were not sufficient to support the valuations of the chicor and bcl long lived assets 
as a result of our assessment  the company recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  associated with our acquisitions of chi cor and bcl 
these impairment charges were recorded in the other industries reportable segment and included impairment of goodwill totaling million and of other acquired intangible assets totaling million 
in the quarter ended december   we recorded impairment charges of million  million and page 
table of contents million  associated with our acquisitions of provato and intersoft and our november technology purchase from ozro  respectively 
terminated deal transaction costs

included in this amount were legal fees of  investment banking charges of  relating to the terminated neoforma transaction  accountant fees and expenses of  and other charges of  restructuring and other charges 
in connection with the closures of our chicago and india offices  the planned reduction of our leased space in london and the significant reduction in our portland  maine operations  as part of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and consolidate operations  we wrote off million in future lease obligations and recognized  in equipment impairment charges during the year ended december  also  we incurred severance costs of  for employees whose employment was terminated during as part of this downsizing effort 
in addition  we recorded a  charge representing the write down in value of various property and equipment assets during the quarter ended march  unrelated to the restructuring of operations 
in  we recorded a  charge which represented a write off of the net carrying value of our investment in tibersoft corporation  a privately held technology company 
other income  net other income  net  decreased by  or  from  in the year ended december   to  in the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to a decrease in interest income  which resulted from lower average cash balances and reduced interest rates during income taxes we incurred operating losses for all quarters in and and have consequently recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset  which consists principally of our net operating loss carryforwards  as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
no provision or benefit for income taxes has been recorded for the years ended december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the same period last year 
this increase resulted primarily from the introduction and sales of new products derived from technology and companies acquired during and licensed largely to existing customers 
also  the average size of new license agreements minimum value of  increased while the number of license contracts sold decreased from in to during the year ended december  an aggregate of of our product revenues in came from existing customers  for the purchase of additional modules  new user licenses  and license renewals 
as a percentage of total revenue  net revenues derived from outside the life sciences segment increased significantly to in  as compared to in the shift reflects an increased emphasis in selling outside of the life sciences vertical as well as greater acceptance of the company s solutions in other vertical markets  particularly in foodservice

the reduction in professional service revenues is attributable to one unusually large consulting engagement  which generated significant revenues beginning in this project began tapering off in late and was completed during cost of revenues cost of revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to the reduction in subcontractor consulting costs from million for the year ended december  to  in the same period in also  travel expenses decreased by  in as compared to as a percentage of total net revenues  cost of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is attributable to the decrease in subcontractor costs discussed above and to the increase in product revenues as a percent of total revenues 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses included a one time  non cash charge of  in the quarter ended june  related to the value associated with the granting of a common stock warrant to accenture llp 
excluding the accenture warrant charge  sales and marketing expense increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily the result of a million increase in sales force salary  commission and fringe benefit costs  partially offset by a million reduction in spending for advertising  marketing and promotional activities

research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase in research and development expenses is principally attributable to higher salary and fringe benefit costs  most of which is the direct result of engineers hired pursuant to our recent acquisitions of netreturn llc and menerva and  to a lesser extent  our establishment of an advanced technology center in our redwood city  california office 
as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expense increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is principally attributable to reductions in salary and benefit costs  of which  represents the year to year reduction in non cash stock compensation to our chief executive officer 
also  decreases in legal fees and travel expenses were offset by higher insurance costs and additions to the provision for doubtful accounts 
as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  depreciation 
from march to june  depreciation included amortization of capitalized internal use software development costs related to the company s internet portal 
excluding amortization related to the internet portal  the value of which was written off during the third quarter of page 
table of contents  depreciation expense increased by  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase is a result of additions of computer hardware and software related to infrastructure expenditures 
amortization of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
the company did not record any amortization of goodwill during the year ended december  as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on january  amortization expense totaling million in the year ended december  represents the amortization of acquired intangible assets with determinable useful lives 
excluding the effect of the amortization of goodwill that was recognized during  amortization expense increased by million  or  from million in the year ended december  this increase in amortization of other purchased intangible assets is attributable to the consummation of additional acquisitions during the third quarter of and first quarter of amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  amounted to million 
in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisitions of menerva in march  provato  inc in august and bcl in april  we allocated million  million and million  respectively  of the purchase price to in process research and development  all of which was immediately expensed as these projects had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
these allocations were based on independent appraisals conducted for the purpose of allocating the initial consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the respective acquisitions 
impairment of intangibles 
in the quarter ended december   we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  associated with our acquisitions of provato and intersoft and our november technology purchase from ozro  respectively 
in the cases of provato and ozro  the values of goodwill and other intangibles were fully written off based upon the company s determination that it was no longer likely to use the technologies it acquired  based on a detailed review of the technology performed by our advanced technology group 
with respect to intersoft  we determined during our budgeting process that the intersoft operation was not likely to generate positive cashflows in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  the full remaining value of intersoft s goodwill and other purchased intangibles was written off 
in the quarter ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of  in connection with a partial write down of the carrying value of goodwill related to the intersoft acquisition 
restructuring and other charges 
in the quarter ended september   we recorded a  charge  which represented a write off of the net carrying value of our investment in tibersoft corporation  a privately held technology company tibersoft 
in the year ended december   we recorded a total of million of charges in connection with a restructuring of the company s operations and the abandonment of our proprietary internet portal 
included in the million charge was the million net carrying value of the internet portal   in severance pay  and  in facility lease costs 
other income  net other income  net decreased by million  or  from million in the year ended december   to  in the year ended december  this decrease is primarily the result of reduced interest yields resulting from an overall decline in market interest rates  and to a lesser extent the reduction in the company s average cash balance during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in page 
table of contents income taxes we incurred operating losses for all quarters in and and have consequently recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset  which consists principally of our net operating loss carryforwards  as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
no provision or benefit for income taxes has been recorded in the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources on february   we completed a private placement of common stock  preferred stock and warrants  resulting in our receipt of million in gross proceeds 
of this amount  million was held in an escrow account pending conversion of the preferred stock into common stock 
at our election  the million in preferred stock was redeemed on july  in and  we entered into several capital lease financing arrangements with a financial institution 
under the terms of the financings  the aggregate proceeds were deposited in a restricted bank account 
at december    of the remaining aggregate proceeds are restricted  of which  is classified as current restricted cash and  is classified as non current restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet 
also  in connection with the financing of our annual directors and officers insurance obligation  we deposited  in a restricted bank account during the quarter ended september   of which  of the deposit remained at december  and is classified as current restricted cash at december  the remaining non current restricted cash balance of  at december  represents cash held on deposit as security on a long term lease obligation 
at december   we had net working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million 
also on december   we had no long term or short term debt  other than obligations under capital lease financings 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted of the net loss of million  as offset by the following non cash items which total million depreciation and amortization of million  impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets of million  restructuring and other charges of million  and noncash warrant  option and stock charges of million 
offsetting this adjusted net loss is a million decrease in accounts receivable net of provision for doubtful accounts of  and a million increase in deferred revenue  partially offset by a million decrease in accrued expenses 
the reduction in accounts receivable was largely attributable to improved collection efforts and a decrease in license revenue  the increase in deferred revenue resulted primarily from the deferral of a million license arrangement during the quarter ended september   that will be recognized as revenue in future periods  and the decrease in accrued expenses consisted primarily of payments of i year end bonuses  commissions and other accrued salaries  ii the acquisition related earnout to netreturn  llc shareholders  and iii million in lease and severance payments related to downsized facilities and employee severances 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted of the net loss of million offset by non cash items depreciation and amortization of million  in process research and development of million  impairment of intangibles of million  restructuring and other charges of  and non cash compensation of  other uses of cash included an aggregate million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by a million increase in deferred revenue and a  provision for bad debts 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included a million purchase of short term investments 
page 
table of contents net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million related to the acquisitions of netreturn and menerva and a million increase in restricted cash  partially offset by a  realization of a long term receivable 
net cash used in financing activities was  in the year ended december   mostly comprised of payments on existing capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily from net proceeds of million from a private placement sale of common stock and additionally from million of stock option exercises 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  possible acquisitions  the timing of expanded product offerings and the success of these offerings if and when they are launched 
accordingly  any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our current balance of cash and cash equivalents is insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity needs  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities to raise funds  and those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
in connection with such a sale of stock  our stockholders may experience dilution 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
our current stock price may make it difficult for us to raise additional equity financing 
contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period amounts in s total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations certain factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we will need to target markets other than the healthcare market for our future growth we will need to continue efforts to reduce our reliance on the health and life sciences market  which has traditionally been the primary source of our revenues 
we will need to target both existing as well as new markets in order to grow our revenues and reach profitability 
revenues from our non healthcare customers have comprised  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and the company must continue to evolve its products and marketing strategies in order to be successful in these markets 
we may not be successful in generating the revenue we expect from these markets 
although we have had some success in selling to markets page 
table of contents outside of healthcare eg  foodservice  we have not yet demonstrated that our product offerings have significant appeal in many of the markets we are targeting 
while we believe that the contractual purchase relationships between manufacturers and customers in these markets have similar attributes to those in the healthcare market  we cannot assure you that our assumptions are correct 
our auditors have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls the company s independent auditors have identified  in connection with their audit of our consolidated financial statements  material weaknesses with respect to the company s internal controls and have communicated to our audit committee their recommendations relating to a need for improvement in the company s internal controls with respect to contracting practices and accounting for revenue recognition 
although we are putting new policies and procedures into place to improve our internal controls  there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these efforts in the near term 
the bid price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has been below per share  and if the bid price again falls below per share for an extended period  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital on april  we received written notification from nasdaq that we were not in compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule b because the closing bid price of our common stock was below for consecutive trading days 
we subsequently regained compliance when the bid price of our common stock closed at per share or more for consecutive trading days 
if the closing bid price again falls below per share for consecutive trading days and we do not regain compliance  we may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
the delisting of our common stock may result in the trading of the stock on the nasdaq smallcap or the otc bulletin board 
consequently  a delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market may reduce the liquidity of our common stock  adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital and could adversely affect our sales efforts 
we have incurred substantial losses in recent years and our return to profitability is uncertain we incurred net losses of million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december   and we had an accumulated deficit at december  of million 
our recent results have been impacted by a number of factors that caused current and prospective customers to defer  or otherwise not make  purchases from us  and we cannot assure you that we will not be affected by these factors in future periods 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve sufficient revenues to become profitable in the future 
it is difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and we often incur significant selling expenses in advance of our recognition of any related revenue our clients view the purchase of our software applications and related professional services as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  clients carefully evaluate our software products and services 
the length of this evaluation process is affected by factors such as the client s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the client is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the license of our software products may also be subject to delays if the client has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes which are quite common in the context of introducing large enterprise wide technology solutions 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a client s evaluation period  including the costs of developing a full proposal and completing a rapid proof of concept or demonstration  before the client places an order with us 
clients may also initially purchase a limited number of licenses before expanding their implementations 
larger clients may purchase our software products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our license revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a significant client for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed  as has occurred in recent quarters  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues during that quarter 
this may cause our operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the value of our common stock to decline 
page 
table of contents economic conditions may continue to weaken our sales the recent downturn and uncertainty in general economic and market conditions have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect demand for our products and services 
if the economic downturn continues or worsens  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  current world economic and political conditions have reduced the willingness of our customers and prospective customers to commit funds to purchase our products and services 
the resulting loss or delay in our sales has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have multiple facilities and we may experience difficulties in operating from these facilities we will continue to operate out of our corporate headquarters in edison  new jersey  our primary engineering office in redwood city  california and in reduced facilities in portland  maine and london  england 
the geographic distance between our offices could make it difficult for our management and other employees to effectively communicate with each other and  as a result  could place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
also  we expect that a significant number of our sales and professional services employees will continue to work remotely out of home offices  which will potentially add to this strain 
we may not be successful in developing or acquiring new technologies or businesses and this could hinder our expansion efforts we intend in the future to continue our product research and development efforts at levels similar to current expenditures and to consider additional acquisitions of or new investments in complementary businesses  products  services or technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our product development efforts or we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition or investment candidates 
even if we do identify suitable acquisition candidates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms 
furthermore  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and the issuance of debt could limit our available cash and accordingly restrict our activities 
we may make additional acquisitions and we may have difficulty integrating them in the past  we have acquired chicor  intersoft  bcl now i many international limited  provato  netreturn  llc and menerva  each of which is or was located in cities very distant from our headquarters in edison  new jersey 
we may make additional acquisitions 
any company that we acquire is likely to be distant from our headquarters in edison  new jersey and will have a culture different from ours as well as technologies  products and services that our employees will need to understand and integrate with our own 
we have assimilated the employees  technologies and products of the companies that we have acquired and will need to do the same with any new companies we may acquire  and that effort has been  and will likely continue to be difficult  time consuming and may be unsuccessful 
if we are not successful  our investment in the acquired entity may be impaired or lost  and even if we are successful  the process of integrating an acquired entity may divert our attention from our core business 
if we do acquire new technologies or businesses  our results of operations may be adversely affected in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded substantial goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
in addition  we recorded charges for write offs of a portion of the purchase prices of acquired companies as in process research and development 
the carrying values of acquired intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the years ended december  and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  in connection page 
table of contents with the write off of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we cannot assure you that future write downs of any such assets will not affect future operating results 
our fixed costs have led  and will continue to lead  to fluctuations in operating results which have resulted  and could in the future result  in a decline of our stock price a significant percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and rent  are fixed costs and are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in revenues 
accordingly  shortfalls in revenues  as we experienced in recent quarters  may cause significant variations in operating results in any quarter 
our stock price has been impacted by the failure of our quarterly results to meet the expectations of market analysts and investors  and it could decline further 
we have many competitors and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively the market for our products and services is competitive and subject to rapid change 
we encounter significant competition for the sale of our contract management software from the internal information systems departments of existing and potential clients  software companies that target the contract management markets and professional services organizations 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of products and services offered 
we anticipate increased competition for market share and pressure to reduce prices and make sales concessions  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and margins 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees and strategic partners 
our competitors could develop products or services that are equal or superior to our solutions or that achieve greater market acceptance than our solutions 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
we may not be able to compete successfully  and competitive pressures may require us to make concessions that will adversely affect our revenues and our margins  or reduce the demand for our products and services 
we rely significantly upon certain key individuals and our business will suffer if we are unable to retain them we depend on the services of our senior management and key technical personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of a 
leigh powell  our chief executive officer  and other key employees 
the loss of the services of any key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
