item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview over the past few years the residential wood furniture industry has experienced a surge in low cost imported products  primarily from china 
imports have grown dramatically in the past few years and according to industry sources it is estimated that imports now account for approximately half of all residential wood furniture sold in the united states 
in response to this trend we continue to develop a blended strategy of combining our domestic manufacturing capabilities with an expanding offshore sourcing program and to realign manufacturing capacity 
we are integrating selected imported component parts and finished items in our product line to lower costs  provide design flexibility and offer a better value to our customers 
sourced products represented approximately of our sales in and we anticipate this percentage to level off at approximately of sales for the increase in offshore sourcing has created excess capacity in our manufacturing facilities which has caused us to reduce and realign manufacturing capacity 
we closed a manufacturing facility in our former west end  north carolina factory and reduced operations at another manufacturing facility in we have realigned production so that each of our current manufacturing facilities is focused on specific product lines of compatible products to improve quality and lower production costs 
these actions have reduced our manufacturing capacity by approximately to 
however  we operated at approximately to of this reduced capacity in near term operating margins will continue to be negatively impacted by low capacity utilization rates as the proportion of sourced goods is expected to grow from approximately of sales in to approximately of sales in we are reluctant to further reduce our manufacturing capacity at the present time in order to provide protective capacity for improved demand and the uncertainty of the outcome of the dumping investigation currently being conducted by the us department of commerce and the international trade commission 
if the investigation determines chinese manufacturers are illegally dumping wooden bedroom furniture into the u 
s 
market  tariffs will be applied to future imports of wooden bedroom furniture from china 
while we cannot predict the outcome or quantify the potential impact  we believe a favorable ruling on behalf of the petitioners will have a positive impact on our financial performance since we source a smaller percentage of wooden bedroom furniture from china than most of our competition 
we will continue to evaluate our manufacturing capacity needs considering increased offshore sourcing  current and anticipated demand for our products  the outcome of the dumping investigation regarding wooden bedroom furniture produced in china  overall market conditions and other factors we consider relevant 
further capacity reductions could cause asset impairment or other restructuring charges in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  net sales cost of sales restructuring and related charges gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses unusual charge restructuring and related charges 
operating income other income  net 

interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income compared to net sales increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to higher unit volume 
we believe this higher unit volume is due to gains in market share resulting from our blended operating strategy that has allowed us to offer improved product styling and value to our customers 
while industry sales trends improved in the second half of  the industry reported a sales decrease in gross profit margin for increased to from in lower gross profit margin in was due primarily to restructuring and related charges resulting from closing a factory to reduce our manufacturing capacity 
the gross profit margin for increased due to savings from sourcing initiatives and the realignment of manufacturing capacity 
these savings were mostly offset by transition and start up costs from increased offshore sourcing  lower production levels at our manufacturing facilities  and other inflationary costs including wages and employee benefits 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was for both and selling  general and administrative expenditures increased million in due primarily to higher sales  expansion of our offshore sourcing program and increased marketing and product development costs 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in bad debt expense 
we recognized  of bad debt expense in compared to a net reversal of  in due to a decrease in accounts receivable from certain customers experiencing financial difficulties 
we expect the trend of higher sourcing costs and increases in certain marketing and product development costs to continue in as a result of the above  operating income for increased to million  or as a percentage of net sales  from million  or as a percentage of net sales  in interest expense for decreased due primarily to lower average debt levels 
the company s effective income tax rate for increased to from in  due primarily to higher state income taxes resulting from the phase out of certain state tax credits 
compared to net sales increased million  or  for compared to the increase was due primarily to higher unit volume 
gross profit margin for increased to from in the increase was due primarily to cost savings resulting from closing our former west end  north carolina facility  offshore sourcing initiatives and lower raw material cost 
this improvement was partially offset by increased restructuring related charges  lower production levels and higher wage and employee benefit expenses  primarily increased health care claims and pension expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses for as a percentage of net sales increased to from for selling  general and administrative expenses increased million compared to primarily as a result of the reinstatement of management bonuses due to higher earnings  higher selling expenses related to new product introductions and increased sales 
an unusual charge of million was recorded in to write off amounts due from a major customer  which declared bankruptcy and closed its stores 
as a result of closing a facility to reduce our manufacturing capacity  we recorded total restructuring and related charges of million 
in  we recorded restructuring and related charges  as a component of cost of sales  of million pretax  that included million for accelerated depreciation and million for other exit costs  including plant operating inefficiencies and severance cost 
in  we recorded restructuring and related charges of million that included million in accelerated depreciation and million for other exit costs 
the restructuring accrual at december  of  consists of a lease obligation for real estate and severance cost 
as a result of the above  operating income increased to million from million in interest expense for decreased due primarily to lower average debt levels 
the company s effective income tax rate increased to for from in the lower percentage was due to lower state income taxes 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity include cash on hand  cash from operations and amounts available under a million credit facility 
these sources have been adequate for day to day expenditures  debt payments  purchases of the company s stock  capital expenditures and payment of cash dividends to stockholders 
we expect these sources of liquidity to continue to be adequate for the future 
working capital has increased due to higher overall finished goods inventory levels as the proportion of our sales from sourced products has increased 
to support our delivery performance  we maintain a higher inventory level of sourced products compared to those we manufacture 
this is partially offset by lower raw material inventories 
we expect this trend to continue in capital expenditures for are anticipated to be approximately million to million for normal replacements and improvements 
as both our sales and the proportion of sourced goods increase we anticipate the need for additional warehouse space 
near term we anticipate leasing space to accommodate our needs 
however  should we decide to invest in our own facilities this could increase our anticipated capital expenditures 
during  the company purchased  shares of its stock in the open market at an average price of 
at december   approximately million remains authorized by our board of directors to repurchase shares of the company s common stock 
consequently  we may  from time to time  either directly or through agents  repurchase our common stock in the open market  through negotiated purchases or otherwise  at prices and on terms satisfactory to the company 
depending on market prices and other conditions relevant to the company  such purchases may be discontinued at any time 
the company s board of directors initiated an annual dividend policy of 
per share in january and increased the annual dividend policy to 
per share in january the aggregate payments for are expected to be approximately million 
the company generated cash from operations of million in compared to million in and million in the increase in cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers and employees for was due primarily to higher sales 
higher tax payments in compared to resulted from timing of estimated tax payments and higher income 
the decrease in cash generated from operations for compared to is attributable primarily to reduced collections from customers as a majority of the sales increase occurred in the fourth quarter of and was collected in the first quarter of offsetting this decrease in was lower tax payments required during as overpayments in were applied to the cash generated from operations in  and was used to repurchase common stock  reduce borrowings  pay cash dividends and fund capital expenditures  reflecting the company s balanced strategy regarding its use of capital 
net cash used by investing activities was million in compared to  and million in and  respectively 
the decline in capital expenditures for both and compared to is due to the relocation of a significant portion of the machinery and equipment from a previously closed facility to other company facilities and used in lieu of normal replacements 
the expenditures in  and were primarily for plant and equipment and other assets in the normal course of business 
in  the company received net proceeds of  from the sale of real estate at its former west end  north carolina facility 
net cash used by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in and  cash from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided cash for purchase and retirement of the company s common stock and senior debt payments 
in  these funds were also used to pay cash dividends 
in  cash from operations and proceeds from the issuance of million in senior notes provided cash for reduction of borrowings under the revolving credit facility  senior debt payments  capital expenditures and purchase and retirement of the company s common stock 
in   shares of the company s common stock were surrendered by an executive officer to the company in payment of a million outstanding loan and accrued interest  relating to stock option exercises in at december   long term debt including current maturities was million 
debt service requirements are million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   approximately million of additional borrowings were available under the company s revolving credit facility and cash on hand was million 
the following table sets forth the company s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payment due or commitment expiration less than over total year years years years contractual cash obligations long term debt      operating leases  total contractual cash obligations      other commercial commitments letters of credit   critical accounting policies management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to accurately and fairly report the company s operational and financial position 
below are the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of trade customers to make required payments 
the company provides an allowance for specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful and also provides an allowance for other accounts based on historical collection and write off experience 
judgment is critical because some customers have experienced financial difficulties 
as the financial condition of these customers change  the level of such allowances will be reevaluated 
during  the credit exposure related to certain customer accounts experiencing financial difficulties declined resulting in a decrease in the allowance for doubtful receivables 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost for all inventories is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company evaluates its inventory to determine excess or slow moving items based on current order activity and projections of future demand 
for those items identified  the company estimates its market value or net sales value based on current trends 
those items having a net sales value less than cost are written down to their net sales value 
this process recognizes projected inventory losses when they become evident rather than at the time they are sold 
long lived assets property and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment when events indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
tax contingencies tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions the company has taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying applications of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
the company s estimate of the value of its tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that the company has accrued 
pension costs the company s pension expense is developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the key assumptions used in developing net pension costs were for both the discount rate and expected return on plan assets compared to and  respectively  in as a result  net pension cost increased  excluding the impact of settlement expense 
in establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption  the company reviews asset allocation considering plan maturity and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses 
actual asset over under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease increase unrecognized loss 
the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods 
a one percentage point change in the expected return assumption in the current year would have resulted in a change in pension expense of approximately  net pension cost for is expected to increase slightly  primarily as a result of a reduction in the discount rate from to 
the company does not have transactions or relationships with special purpose entities  and the company does not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases primarily for showroom and certain technology equipment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s because the company s obligation under its revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate  the company is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates 
a one percentage point fluctuation in market interest rates would not have had a material impact on earnings in
