item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a self administered reit and we primarily own real estate that we net lease to tenants 
as of december   we owned properties  participated in four joint ventures that owned a total of properties and held a tenancy in common interest in one property 
these properties are located in states 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we currently distribute at least of ordinary taxable income to our stockholders 
we intend to comply with these requirements and to maintain our reit status 
our principal business strategy is to acquire improved  commercial properties subject to long term net leases 
we acquire properties for their value as long term investments and for their ability to generate income over an extended period of time 
we borrow funds on a secured and unsecured basis to finance the purchase of real estate and we intend to continue to do so in the future 
our rental properties are generally leased to corporate tenants under operating leases  substantially all of which are noncancellable 
substantially all of our lease agreements are net lease arrangements that require the tenant to pay not only rent  but also substantially all of the operating expenses of the leased property including maintenance  taxes  utilities and insurance 
a majority of our lease agreements provide for periodic rental increases and certain of our other leases provide for increases based on the consumer price index 
during the year ended december   we purchased five single tenant properties including our purchase of one tenancy in common interest in five states  for a total consideration of  we assumed pre existing first mortgages aggregating  on three of these properties 
an aggregate of  of first mortgage financing was completed with respect to the other two acquisitions  one of which represents a  mortgage loan secured by the property owned by us and another investor as tenants in common 
we are a venturer in two joint ventures organized for the purpose of acquiring and owning megaplex stadium style movie theaters 
we own a equity interest in each of these ventures with the same co venturer 
these joint ventures have acquired one partial stadium style theater  one stadium style theater under construction  and eight megaplex stadium style movie theaters for a total consideration of approximately million 
our equity investment in these ventures at december  was million  net of distributions from the joint ventures 
in february  we contributed our leasehold interest in an industrial property in miami  florida to a joint venture with the owners of the fee estate in that property in exchange for an approximately interest in the joint venture 
in december  we invested million for a interest in a joint venture which owns a free standing retail property located in shreveport  louisiana 
at december   excluding mortgages payable of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we had outstanding mortgages payable  aggregating million in principal amount  all of which are secured by first liens on individual real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million before accumulated depreciation 
the mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and mature between and results of operations outlook in may  and in october and november we completed two public offerings resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million and million  respectively 
a major portion of the net proceeds from the may offering was applied to acquire  both directly by us and through joint ventures  five properties 
these acquisitions contributed to a increase in rental income and a increase in net income in fiscal through december  we had used million of the net proceeds from the offering million to redeem our preferred stock and million to pay down our credit line and at december  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents available plus million available under our credit line 
in  we anticipate that we will use our available cash and our credit line to acquire additional properties  either directly or through joint ventures 
as a result  we will own more properties and unless we experience an unusual number of lease terminations and or cancellations in taking into consideration the lease expirations and terminations that we know will occur in  and without giving effect to any re letting of such properties  we anticipate that our revenues and possibly our net income will increase in and comparison of years ended december  and december  revenues our revenues consist primarily of rental income from tenants in our rental properties 
rental income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental income is due to million of rental income earned on eight properties acquired by us between september and september  offset to the extent of  due to the vacancy of one of our retail properties 
interest and other income decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease was the receipt in the year ended december  of non recurring net acquisition fees from our movie theater joint ventures of  compared to  of such fees in the year ended december   and the receipt in of other non recurring income of  we also experienced a  decrease in interest income in the year ended december  due to the investment in cash equivalents and treasury bills of the balance of the net proceeds received from our may public offering  a significant portion of which was utilized for property acquisitions by december  the net proceeds from our october public offering were invested for the two months remaining in fiscal offsetting these decreases in interest and other income was a  increase in the year ended december  in interest earned on short term mortgages receivable which were acquired or originated by us to facilitate acquisitions 
our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to the purchase of nine movie theaters by our two movie theater joint ventures at various times between april and july and our purchase of an additional interest in one of the movie theater joint ventures on october  the increase is also due to the purchase of a retail property by another joint venture in december expenses depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the acquisition of eight properties between september and september interest on mortgages payable increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a result of increased borrowings related to property acquisitions 
this increase resulted from mortgages placed on three properties in december and october  the assumption of mortgages in connection with the purchase of three properties between february and september and the refinancing of one property 
interest line of credit increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from increased borrowings under our line of credit to facilitate the purchase of several properties 
the borrowings were repaid with the proceeds of two mortgage financings and with a portion of the proceeds received from our public offering in october general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in payroll and payroll expenses in the year ended december   including an increase of approximately  for executive and support personnel  primarily for legal and accounting services  allocated to us pursuant to a shared services agreement between us and related entities 
this increase in the allocated payroll expenses resulted from a significant increase in our level of business activity  primarily property acquisitions  the negotiation and consummation of a revolving credit facility  mortgage refinancings  lease negotiations and corporate governance matters 
general and administrative expenses in also reflects an increase in direct payroll expenses resulting from a  increase in the annual base salary and a  bonus to our president and chief executive officer 
also included in the year ended december  is compensation expense of  relating to the issuance of restricted stock 
the general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is net of a  partial reimbursement from one of our movie theater joint ventures for legal services allocated to us under the shared services agreement relating to movie theater acquisitions and mortgage financing 
the balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  is due to an increase in a number of items including professional fees of approximately  and travel expenses of approximately  a major portion of which is related to our property acquisition activities 
in october and november   we sold million shares of our common stock including  shares subject to the underwriters over allotment option in a public offering in which we raised approximately million 
allocated payroll and payroll related expenses of  primarily for legal and accounting services resulting from time expended by various executive and administrative personnel in connection with the preparation and filing of a shelf registration statement on form s on september   declared effective by the sec on october   and the related prospectus supplement have been included in public offering expenses for the year ended december  in the year ended december    of public offering expenses were allocated to us in connection with an offering consummated in may pursuant to which we raised approximately million 
real estate expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to legal fees relating to properties  as well as utilities and real estate tax expense on our vacant property 
additionally  includes the amortization of a commission relating to a renegotiated lease  non recurring landlord repairs and an increase in insurance expense 
comparison of years ended december  and december  revenues our revenues consist primarily of rental income from tenants in our rental properties 
in the latter part of we identified megaplex movie theaters  particularly stadium style movie theaters  as an attractive investment opportunity and made a business judgment to invest in this class of assets with joint venture partners 
our equity investment in movie theater joint ventures was million at december   net of distributions from the joint ventures 
in february we contributed our leasehold position in an industrial building to a joint venture organized by us with the owners of the fee estate of the property and in december  we invested million in a joint venture which owns one free standing retail property 
investments by us in in joint venture activities  particularly in the movie theater joint ventures  rather than solely in properties owned by us  and the contribution of our leasehold position in an industrial property to a joint venture  were the major reasons for a decrease in rental income of  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  rental income also decreased as a result of the sale of three retail properties and the vacancy of two retail properties in rental income was positively impacted by rent increases at five of our properties and from rental income earned on three properties acquired by us between september and december interest and other income increased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  approximately  of this increase was due to net acquisition fees received by us from the movie theater joint ventures 
the net acquisition fees  calculated pursuant to our joint venture agreements at of the purchase price of eight properties acquired during  reflects a reduction based on our proportionate share of ownership in the joint ventures 
interest earned on three mortgages  totaling approximately million  acquired by us during august in connection with the acquisition by one of our joint ventures of an eight screen partial stadium style theater accounted for  of the increase in interest and other income 
to a lesser extent  this increase is due to the investment in cash equivalents and treasury bills of the balance of the net proceeds received from our may public offering 
our equity in the earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures  totaling  in  in  more than exceeded the  decrease in rental revenues in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures consists of  in from the nine movie theater properties owned by our two movie theater joint ventures during in our movie theater joint ventures owned one movie theater for the entire year  with the other eight theaters being acquired at various times between april and december in our movie theater joint ventures owned one theater for less than two full months 
in we also recognized  as our equity share in the earnings of the joint venture organized in february that owns an industrial building in miami  florida 
the other joint venture we participate in was organized in december and recorded a loss of  in due to costs incurred in organizing the venture 
we will continue to acquire  solely for our own account  improved commercial properties in accordance with our business and investment strategies 
we may from time to time acquire properties with joint venture partners 
expenses interest mortgages payable increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from mortgages placed on two properties during march and april  and was offset in part by the payoff of two mortgage loans totaling million during june interest line of credit decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from our repayment of all of the outstanding indebtedness under our line of credit during we subsequently borrowed million under our line of credit during may  which was used for our contribution to one of our joint ventures for the purchase of two movie theaters 
the borrowing was repaid with a portion of the proceeds received from our public offering completed in may we subsequently borrowed million under our line of credit during december  which was used to purchase a property 
leasehold rent expense decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this rent expense was payable on the leasehold interest position that we contributed during february to a joint venture in which we hold an approximately interest 
therefore  effective february  we no longer paid leasehold rent 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a  increase in payroll and payroll expenses  including approximately  for executive and support personnel  primarily for legal and accounting services allocated to us pursuant to a shared services agreement between us and related entities 
the increase in the allocated payroll expenses resulted from an increase in our level of business activity  primarily property acquisition activity 
the increase in payroll expenses is also due to compensation and fees approved by our compensation committee and board of directors and recorded during the year ended december  as follows an increase of  in the base salary and a bonus of  to our president and chief executive officer and a fee of  per annum to the chairman of our board of directors 
the balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses is due to a number of items including public company expenses  professional fees  travel  franchise taxes and minor increases in several other categories of general and administrative expenses 
these increases were offset in part by the receipt by us of  from one of our movie theater joint ventures as partial reimbursement of legal services allocated to us under the shared services agreement  for movie theater acquisitions and mortgage financing 
on may   we sold million shares of common stock in a follow on public offering 
allocated payroll and payroll related expenses  primarily for legal and accounting services resulting from time expended by various executive and administrative personnel in connection with the preparation and filing of a registration statement declared effective by the sec on may   have been included in the line item public offering expenses for the year ended december  these expenses were allocated pursuant to the shared services agreement 
real estate expenses decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the write off of a leasing commission and non recurring landlord repairs during liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   substantially all of which represents the balance of the proceeds received by us from a public offering completed in october and november our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  our revolving credit facility and cash generated from operating activities including mortgage financings 
we are a party to a credit agreement with valley national bank  merchants bank division and bank leumi  usa which provides for a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility is available to us to pay down existing mortgages  to fund the acquisition of additional properties or to invest in joint ventures 
the facility matures on march  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the bank s prime rate  currently  and there is an unused facility fee of one quarter of per annum 
net proceeds received from the sale or refinancing of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties and is secured by the outstanding stock of subsidiary entities 
there is currently zero outstanding under the facility 
we  on our own behalf and on behalf of our joint ventures  are involved in various stages of negotiation with respect to the acquisition of additional net leased properties 
we will use the balance of the proceeds from our recently completed public offering  cash provided from operations  cash provided from mortgage financings and our credit facility to fund additional acquisitions 
the following sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december   all of which relate to interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties  for the periods indicated amounts in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years mortgages payable interest and amortization      mortgages payable balances due at maturity     total      as of december   we had outstanding approximately million in long term mortgage indebtedness excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that debt service payments of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that loan maturities of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from mortgage financings or refinancings 
if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow will not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt when payments become due  and we may be forced to sell additional equity or dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms 
we had no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our shareholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these significant accounting policies include revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of each lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant is engaged and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we would be required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which would have an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken and would decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
at december   management has not taken a reserve or direct write off against the unbilled rent receivable of million 
however  at december   one of the movie theater joint ventures  of which we are a venturer  took a reserve of  against its total unbilled rent receivable of  related to two movie theaters leased to operators under common control 
value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there has been any impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets in order to determine if there is any need for a provision for valuation adjustment 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  its location  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
we also ascertain appropriate capitalization rates for the real estate asset in the area in which the property is located and apply such capitalization rate to the net operating income derived from that asset 
we do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any provision taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of the valuation allowance  but it will not affect our cash flow until such time as the property is sold 
there were no valuation adjustments recorded in the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
in fiscal the effect on the financial statements was not material 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk all of our long term mortgage debt bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that the company incurs under these mortgages 
the company s credit line is a variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
however  at december   no amounts were outstanding under the facility
