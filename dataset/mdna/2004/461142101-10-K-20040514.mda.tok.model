the company continues to work closely with leaders of the speech technology industry 
intervoice partners with scansoft to develop and bring to market speech recognition and text to speech solutions 
the company leverages nuance speech software solutions to give people access to information and services anywhere  anytime and from any phone 
backlog the company s solutions backlog at february   and  which does not include the contracted value of future maintenance and managed services to be recognized by the company  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects all existing backlog to be delivered within fiscal due to customer demand  some of the company s sales are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
thus  the company s backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of actual sales for any future period 
research and development research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  and included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the company s research and development spending is focused in four key areas 
first  software tools are being developed to aid in the development  deployment and management of customer applications incorporating speech recognition and text to speech technologies 
next  server based software platforms are being developed for runtime services for the management of contact center resources and speech applications 
software platforms are being developed for deployment and management of wireless and wireline network operator applications 
these software platforms are designed to operate in both jee and microsoft s 
net enterprise computing environments 
third  media servers and voice browsers based on open standards such as salt and voicexml are being developed 
finally  the company is developing packaged  speech enabled applications for the network operator and enterprise markets 
these include a range of vertical and horizontal applications that are designed to greatly enhance customer roi by providing many commonly used  configurable functions that can be more quickly deployed than custom applications 
the company expects to maintain a strong commitment to research and development to remain at the forefront of technology development in its markets  which is essential to the continued improvement of the company s position in the industry 
proprietary rights the company believes that its existing patent  copyright  license and other proprietary rights in its products and technologies are material to the conduct of its business 
to protect these proprietary rights  the company relies on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and other proprietary rights laws  nondisclosure safeguards and license agreements 
as of february   the company owned patents and had pending applications for patents in the united states 
in addition  the company has registered intervoice as a trademark in the united states 
currently  in the united states  the company has registered trademarks and service marks 
some of the company s patents and marks are also registered in certain foreign countries 
the company also has five registered copyrights in the united states 
the company s software and other products are generally licensed to customers pursuant to a nontransferable license agreement that restricts the use of the software and other products to the customer s internal purposes 
although the company s license agreements prohibit a customer from disclosing proprietary information contained in the company s products to any other person  it is technologically possible for competitors of the company to copy aspects of the company s products in violation of the company s rights 
furthermore  even in cases where patents are granted  the detection and policing of the unauthorized use of the patented 
table of contents technology is difficult 
moreover  judicial enforcement of copyrights may be uncertain  particularly in foreign countries 
the occurrence of the unauthorized use of the company s proprietary information by the company s competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company provides its customers a qualified indemnity against the infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
from time to time various owners of patents and copyrighted works send the company or its customers letters alleging that the company s products do or might infringe upon the owners intellectual property rights  and or suggesting that the company or its customers should negotiate a license or cross license agreement with the owner 
the company s policy is to never knowingly infringe upon any third party s intellectual property rights 
accordingly  the company forwards any such allegation or licensing request to its outside legal counsel for their review and opinion 
the company generally attempts to resolve any such matter by informing the owner of its position concerning non infringement or invalidity  and or  if appropriate  negotiating a license or cross license agreement 
even though the company attempts to resolve these matters without litigation  it is always possible that the owner of the patent or copyrighted works will institute litigation 
owners of patent s and or copyrighted work s have previously instituted litigation against the company alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights  although no such litigation is currently pending against the company 
as noted above  the company currently has a portfolio of patents  and it has applied for and will continue to apply for and receive a number of additional patents to reflect its technological innovations 
the company believes that its patent portfolio could allow it to assert counterclaims for infringement against certain owners of intellectual property rights if those owners were to sue the company for infringement 
in certain situations  it might be beneficial for the company to cross license certain of its patents for other patents which are relevant to the call automation industry 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain patent matters 
the company believes that software and technology companies  including the company and others in the company s industry  increasingly may become subject to infringement claims 
such claims may require the company to enter into costly license agreements  or result in even more costly litigation 
to the extent the company requires a licensing arrangement  the arrangement may not be available at all  or  if available  may be very expensive or even prohibitively expensive 
as with any legal proceeding  there is no guarantee that the company will prevail in any litigation instituted against the company asserting infringement of intellectual property rights 
to the extent the company suffers an adverse judgment  it might have to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  repurchase infringing products from the company s customers pursuant to indemnity obligations  expend significant resources to acquire non infringing alternatives  and or obtain licenses to the intellectual property that has been infringed upon 
as with licensing arrangements  non infringing substitute technologies may not be available  and if available  may be very expensive  or even prohibitively expensive  to implement 
accordingly  for all of the foregoing reasons  a claim of infringement could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing and facilities the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of the final assembly  integration and extensive testing and quality control of subassemblies  host computer platforms  operating software and the company s run time software 
the company currently uses third parties to perform printed circuit board assembly  sheet metal fabrication and customer site service and repair 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  some of its components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  the company licenses speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
as the company continues to migrate to open  standards based systems  it will become increasingly dependent on its component suppliers and software vendors 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner 
if the company s significant vendors are unable or cease to supply components or licenses at current levels  the company may not be able to obtain these items from another source or at historical prices 
consequently  the company would be unable 
table of contents to provide products and services to its customers or generate historical operating margins  which would negatively impact its business and operating results

katz technology licensing lp raktl has sent letters to certain customers of the company suggesting that the customer should negotiate a license agreement to cover the practice of certain patents owned by raktl 
in the letters  raktl has alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain enhanced services offered by network providers  including prepaid card and wireless services and postpaid card services 
raktl has further alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain call processing applications  including applications for call centers that route calls using a called party s dnis identification number 
as a result of the correspondence  an increasing number of the company s customers have had discussions  or are in discussions  with raktl 
certain products offered by the company can be programmed and configured to provide enhanced services to network providers and call processing applications for call centers 
the company s contracts with customers usually include a qualified obligation to indemnify and defend customers against claims that products as delivered by the company infringe a third party s patent 

table of contents none of the company s customers have notified the company that raktl has claimed that any product provided by the company infringes any claims of any raktl patent 
accordingly  the company has not been required to defend any customers against a claim of infringement under a raktl patent 
the company has  however  received letters from customers notifying the company of the efforts by raktl to license its patent portfolio and reminding the company of its potential obligations under the indemnification provisions of the applicable agreements in the event that a claim is asserted 
in response to correspondence from raktl  a few customers have attempted to tender to the company the defense of its products under contractual indemnity provisions 
the company has informed these customers that while it fully intends to honor any contractual indemnity provisions  it does not believe it currently has any obligation to provide such a defense because raktl does not appear to have made a claim that a company product infringes a patent 
some of these customers have disagreed with the company and believe that the correspondence from raktl can be construed as claim s against the company s products 
one such customer who had attempted to tender the defense of its products to the company recently informed the company that the customer had entered into an agreement to license certain rights under the raktl patents and demanded the company indemnify the customer for unspecified amounts  including attorney s fees  paid in connection with the license agreement 
the company has notified the customer that the company believes it does not have any indemnity obligation in connection with the license agreement 
even though raktl has not alleged that a product provided by the company infringes a raktl patent  it is always possible that raktl may do so 
in the event that a company product becomes the subject of litigation  a customer could attempt to invoke the company s indemnity obligations under the applicable agreement 
as with most sales contracts with suppliers of computerized equipment  the company s contractual indemnity obligations are generally limited to the products and services provided by the company  and generally require the customer to allow the company to have control over any litigation and settlement negotiations with the patent holder 
the customers who have received letters from raktl generally have multiple suppliers of the types of products that might potentially be subject to claims by raktl 
even though no claims have been made that a specific product offered by the company infringes any claim under the raktl patent portfolio  the company has received opinions from its outside patent counsel that certain products and applications offered by the company do not infringe certain claims of the raktl patents 
the company has also received opinions from its outside counsel that certain claims under the raktl patent portfolio are invalid or unenforceable 
furthermore  based on the reviews by outside counsel  the company is not aware of any valid and enforceable claims under the raktl portfolio that are infringed by the company s products 
if the company does become involved in litigation in connection with the raktl patent portfolio  under a contractual indemnity or any other legal theory  the company intends to vigorously contest the claims and to assert appropriate defenses 
an increasing number of companies  including some large  well known companies and some customers of the company  have already licensed certain rights under the raktl patent portfolio 
raktl has previously announced license agreements with  among others  at t corp  microsoft corporation and international business machines corporation

plaintiffs have asserted that these alleged statements resulted in artificially inflated stock prices 
the company believes that it and its officers complied with their obligations under the securities laws and has vigorously defended the lawsuit 
the company responded to this complaint by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint in the consolidated proceeding 
the company asserted that the complaint lacked the degree of specificity and factual support to meet the pleading standards applicable to federal securities litigation 
on this basis  the company requested that the united states district court for the northern district of texas dismiss the complaint in its entirety 
plaintiffs responded to the company s request for dismissal 
on august   the court entered an order granting the company s motion to dismiss the class action lawsuit 
in the order dismissing the lawsuit  the court granted plaintiffs an opportunity to reinstate the lawsuit by filing an amended complaint 
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on september  the company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint  and plaintiffs filed a response in opposition to the company s motion to dismiss

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary disclosures to qualify forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including  without limitation  statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements located elsewhere herein regarding the company s financial position  business strategy  plans and objectives of management of the company for future operations  and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the company cautions current and potential investors that the following important risk factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause such results during fiscal  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company the company is prone to quarterly sales fluctuations 
some of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any quarter can cause wide variations in the company s quarterly sales and earnings  as such sales are unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
the company s accuracy in estimating future sales is largely dependent on its ability to successfully qualify  estimate and close system sales from its pipeline of sales opportunities during a quarter 
no matter how promising a pipeline opportunity may appear  there is no assurance it will ever result in a sale 
accordingly  the company s actual sales for any fiscal reporting period may be significantly different from any estimate of sales for such period 
see the discussion entitled sales in this item for a discussion of the company s system for estimating sales and trends in its business 
the company s financing agreements include significant financial and operating covenants and default provisions 
in addition to obligations requiring the monthly payment of interest  the company s line of credit agreement and its mortgage loan facility contain significant financial covenants  operating covenants and default provisions 
if the company does not comply with any of these covenants and default provisions  the company s secured lenders can accelerate all indebtedness outstanding under the facilities and foreclose on a significant portion of the company s assets 
the company is subject to potential and pending lawsuits and other claims 
the company is subject to certain potential and pending lawsuits and other claims discussed in item legal proceedings 
the company believes the pending lawsuit to which it is subject is without merit and intends to defend the matter vigorously 
the company may not prevail in the pending litigation or other matters 
there can be no assurance that expenses  including any potential settlement or judgment  related to any lawsuit would not be material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company faces intense competition based on product capabilities and experiences ever increasing demands from its actual and prospective customers for its products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
the ultimate success of the company s products is dependent  to a large degree  on the company allocating 
table of contents its resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by the company s actual and prospective customers 
the company s success is also dependent  to a large degree  on the company s ability to implement arrangements with other vendors with complementary product offerings to provide actual and prospective customers greater functionality and to ensure that the company s products are compatible with the increased variety of technologies and standards 
the principal competitors for the company s solutions include genesys  avaya  ibm  nortel  aspect communications  edify  comverse technology and lucent technologies 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company 
although the company has committed substantial resources to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products  it may not be successful 
the company may not be successful in transitioning to an open  standards based business model 
the company has historically provided complete  bundled hardware and software systems using internally developed components to address its customers total business needs 
increasingly  the markets for the company s products are requiring a shift to the development of products and services based on an open  standards based architecture such as the jee and microsoft s 
net environments utilizing voicexml and or salt standards 
such an open  standards based approach allows customers to independently purchase and combine hardware components  standardized software modules  and customization  installation and integration services from individual vendors deemed to offer the best value in the particular class of product or service 
in such an environment  the company believes it may sell less hardware and fewer bundled systems and may become increasingly dependent on its development and sale of software application packages  customized software and consulting and integration services 
this shift will place new challenges on the company s management to transition its products and to hire and retain the mix of personnel necessary to respond to this business environment  to adapt to the changing expense structure that the new environment may tend to foster  and to increase sales of services  customized software and application packages to offset reduced sales of hardware and bundled systems 
if the company is unsuccessful in resolving one or more of these challenges  the company s revenues and profitability could decline 
the company may incur additional expense as open standards evolve over time 
open standards are relatively new to the company s industry  and such standards continue to evolve 
furthermore  some of the technologies that are incorporated in the company s products are subject to different and competing open standards  and the ultimate success or failure of some of these competing standards remains uncertain 
the company is not in a position to control  know or necessarily forecast changes that may be made to existing open standards in the future or the potential adoption of new open standards 
accordingly  it will remain difficult for the company to estimate the level of r d expenditures that will be necessary in future periods to comply with existing standards and  potentially  to migrate to new open standards 
the company may not be able to retain its customer base and  in particular  its more significant customers 
the company s success depends substantially on retaining its significant customers 
the loss of one of the company s significant customers could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
the company s installed base of customers generally is not contractually obligated to place further solutions orders with the company or to extend their services contracts with the company at the expiration of their current contracts 
the company will be harmed if it loses key business and technical personnel 
the company relies upon the services of a relatively small number of key technical and senior management personnel  most of whom do not have employment contracts 
if the company were to lose any of its key technical  project management  or senior management personnel  replacing them could be difficult and costly 
if it were unable to successfully and promptly replace such personnel  the business could be materially harmed 

table of contents if requirements relating to the accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  the company may be forced to change its compensation practices 
the company currently accounts for the issuance of stock options using the intrinsic value method as defined in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the financial accounting standards board has issued an exposure draft that requires companies to include a compensation expense in their statements of operations relating to the issuance of employee stock options 
the change in accounting for stock options is presently anticipated to become effective for the company s fiscal year beginning march  if this change is adopted  the company will incur additional expense if it continues to use stock options as part of its compensation strategy 
alternatively  the company could decide to decrease or eliminate the use of employee stock options as an element of its overall compensation plan 
such an action  however  could affect the company s ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates for open positions  and or it could increase the cash compensation the company would have to pay 
the company s reliance on significant vendor relationships could result in significant expense or an inability to serve its customers if it loses these relationships 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  some of its components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  the company licenses speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
as the company continues to migrate to open  standards based systems  it will become increasingly dependent on its component suppliers and software vendors 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner 
if the company s significant vendors are unable or cease to supply components or licenses at current levels  the company may not be able to obtain these items from another source or at historical prices 
consequently  the company would be unable to provide products and to service its customers or to generate historical operating margins  which would negatively impact its business and operating results 
if third parties assert claims that the company s products or services infringe on their technology and related intellectual property rights  whether the claims are made directly against the company or against the company s customers  the company could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
if any of these claims is ultimately successful  a third party could require the company to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to acquire non infringing alternatives  and or obtain licenses to use the infringed intellectual property rights 
moreover  where the claims are asserted with respect to the company s customers  additional expenses may be involved in indemnifying the customer and or designing and providing non infringing products 
the company is exposed to risks related to its international operations that could increase its costs and hurt its business 
the company s products are currently sold in more than countries 
the company s international sales  as a percentage of total company sales  were in fiscal and and in fiscal international sales are subject to certain risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  greater difficulty in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights  general economic and political conditions in each country  loss of revenue  property and equipment from expropriation  import and export licensing requirements  and additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations  including risks arising from customers speaking different languages and having different cultural approaches to the conduct of business 
the company s inability to meet contracted performance targets could subject it to significant penalties 
many of the company s contracts  particularly for managed services  foreign contracts and contracts with telecommunication companies  include provisions for the assessment of liquidated damages for delayed project completion and or for the company s failure to achieve certain minimum 
table of contents service levels 
the company has had to pay liquidated damages in the past and may have to pay additional liquidated damages in the future 
any such future liquidated damages could be significant 
the company is exposed to general economic conditions that may harm its business 
although the general level of business activity rebounded during the company s fiscal year ended february   the company has been affected by the general economic downturn of the preceding several years  including  particularly  the downturn in the telecommunications markets 
if united states or global economic conditions deteriorate again in the future  it is possible that capital spending for advanced technology such as that offered by the company will again decline 
if such unfavorable economic conditions were to occur in the united states or internationally  such conditions could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and financial industries could affect the company s revenues and profitability 
the majority of the company s significant customers are in the telecommunications and financial industries  which are undergoing increasing consolidation as a result of merger and acquisition activity 
this activity involving the company s significant customers could decrease the number of customers purchasing the company s products and or delay purchases of the company s products by customers that are in the process of reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a pending merger or acquisition 
if the company has fewer customers or its customers delay purchases of the company s products as a result of merger and acquisition activity  the company s revenues and profitability could decline 
the occurrence of force majeure events could impact the company s results from operations 
the occurrence of one or more of the following events could potentially cause the company to incur significant losses acts of god  war  riot  embargoes  acts of civil or military authorities  acts of terrorism or sabotage  shortage of supply or delay in delivery by the company s vendors  the spread of sars or other diseases  fire  flood  explosion  earthquake  accident  strikes  radiation  inability to secure transportation  failure of communications  failure of utilities or similar events

critical accounting policies in preparing its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the company uses estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and that may vary from actual results 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware and software solutions  from the delivery of maintenance and other customer services associated with installed solutions and from the provision of its enhanced telecommunications services and ivr applications on a managed service basis

sale of hardware and software solutions many of the company s sales are of customized software or customized hardware software solutions 
such solutions incorporate newly designed software and or standard building blocks of hardware and software which have been significantly modified  configured and assembled to match unique customer requirements defined at the beginning of each project

in other instances  particularly in situations where the company sells to distributors or where the company is supplying only additional product capacity ie  similar hardware and software solutions to what is already in place for an existing customer  the company may sell solutions that do not require significant customization 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
typically  this is at shipment when there is no installation obligation or at the completion of minor post shipment installation obligations 
generally  the company uses poc accounting for its more complex custom solutions 
in determining whether a particular sale qualifies for poc treatment  the company considers multiple factors including the value of the contract and the degree of customization inherent in the project 
projects normally must have an aggregate value of more than  to qualify for poc treatment 
for a project accounted for under the poc method  the company recognizes revenue as work progresses over the life of the project based on a comparison of actual labor inputs labor hours worked to current estimates of total labor inputs required to complete the project 
project estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the terms of most poc projects require customers to make interim progress payments during the course of the project 
such payments and a written customer acknowledgement at the completion of the project  usually following a final customer test phase  document the customer s acceptance of the project 
in some circumstances  the passage of a contractually defined time period or the customer s use of the system in a live operating environment may also constitute final acceptance of a project 
the company uses completed contract accounting for smaller custom projects not meeting the poc thresholds described above 
the company also uses completed contract accounting in situations where the technical requirements of a project are so complex or are so dependent on the development of new technologies or the unique application of existing technologies that the company s ability to make reasonable estimates is in doubt or where a sale is subject to unusual inherent hazards that make the company s estimates doubtful 
such hazards are unrelated to  or only incidentally related to  the company s typical activities and include situations where the enforceability of a contract is suspect  completion of the contract is subject to pending litigation  or where the systems produced are subject to condemnation or expropriation risks 
these latter situations are extremely rare 
for all completed contract sales  the company recognizes revenue upon customer acceptance as evidenced by a written customer acknowledgement  the passage of a contractually defined time period or the customer s use of the solutions in a live operating environment 
the company generates a significant percentage of its sales  particularly sales of enhanced telecommunications services solutions  outside the united states 
customers in certain countries are subject to significant economic and political challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  the company may offer selected customers such payment terms 
in all cases  however  the company only recognizes revenue at such time as its solutions or service fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in some limited cases  this policy may result in the company recognizing revenue on a cash basis  limiting revenue recognition on certain sales of solutions and or services to the actual cash received to date from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 

table of contents sale of maintenance and other customer services the company recognizes revenue from maintenance and other customer services when the services are performed or ratably over the related contract period 
all significant costs and expenses associated with maintenance contracts are expensed as incurred 
this approximates a ratable recognition of expenses over the contract period 
sale of managed services the company can provide enhanced communications solutions to customers on an outsourced basis through its managed service business 
while specific arrangements can vary  the company generally builds a customized system to address a specific customer s business need and then owns  monitors  and maintains that system  ensuring that it processes the customer s business transactions in accordance with defined specifications 
for its services  the company generally receives a one time setup fee paid at the beginning of the contract and a service fee paid monthly over the life of the contract 
most contracts range from to months in length 
the company combines the setup fee and the total service fee to be received from the customer and recognizes revenue ratably over the term of the managed service contract 
the company capitalizes the cost of the computer system s and related applications used to provide the service and depreciates such costs over the contract life for assets unique to the individual contract or the life of the equipment for assets common to the general managed service operations or for assets whose useful lives are shorter than the related contract term 
all labor and other period costs required to provide the service are expensed as incurred 
loss contracts the company updates its estimates of the costs necessary to complete all customer contracts in process on a quarterly basis 
whenever current estimates indicate that the company will incur a loss on the completion of a contract  the company immediately records a provision for such loss as part of the current period cost of goods sold 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
inventories are recorded at standard cost which approximates actual cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company periodically reviews its inventories for unsaleable or obsolete items and for items held in excess quantities based on current and projected usage 
adjustments are made where necessary to reduce the carrying value of individual items to reflect the lower of cost or market  and any such adjustments create a new carrying value for the affected items 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets intangible assets are comprised of separately identifiable intangible assets arising out of the company s fiscal acquisition of brite voice systems  inc  and certain capitalized purchased software 
intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over each asset s estimated useful life 
such lives range from five to twelve years 
the company reviews its intangible assets for possible impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with such assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets 
in those situations  the company recognizes an impairment loss on the intangible asset equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value  generally determined based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows 
the cost of internally developed software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products for sale are expensed until technological feasibility is established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
technological feasibility of a computer software product is established when the company has completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
no costs have been capitalized to date for internally developed software products and enhancements as the company s current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility 
the company capitalizes purchased software upon acquisition when 
table of contents such software is technologically feasible or if it has an alternative future use  such as use of the software in different products or resale of the purchased software 
goodwill the company s goodwill also results from its fiscal purchase of brite voice systems  inc under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which the company adopted on march   goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to annual amortization 
goodwill is subjected  however  to tests for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if triggering events are identified on an interim basis 
the impairment review follows the two step approach defined in sfas no 
the first step compares the fair value of the company with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  the company must compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the lesser of that excess or the carrying amount of goodwill 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized using the liability method and reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in circumstances where it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
this is a highly subjective assessment and requires the company to evaluate the predictability of future taxable income while considering the significant losses the company incurred in fiscal and in general  the company does not anticipate reversing valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets of its us and us operations until the earlier of the time that the underlying deferred tax assets are realized or the time at which the respective taxable entities actual results have demonstrated a sustained profitability and their projected results support the company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets currently being reserved 
sales the company is a leader in providing converged voice and data solutions and related services 
as used herein  solutions sales include the sale of hardware and or software and the related professional services associated with designing  integrating  and installing custom applications to address customers business needs 
recurring services include a suite of maintenance and software upgrade offerings and the provision of customized solutions to customers on a managed service outsourced basis 
the company s solutions product line includes ivr portal solutions  messaging solutions  and payment solutions 
in prior years  the company identified its sales of solutions and related services as being sales to the enterprise and network markets 
generally sales of ivr portal solutions and related services were made to enterprise customers  while sales of messaging and payment solutions were made to network customers 
beginning in fiscal  the company determined that product line distinction provided the most meaningful breakdown of quarterly and annual sales activity and began capturing and reporting its activity in that manner 
the company is not able to provide the historical breakdown of network system sales into its messaging and payment systems components 

table of contents the company s sales by product line for fiscal  and were as follows in millions ivr portal solution sales enterprise systems sales prior to fiscal messaging solution sales included in network system sales prior to fiscal payment solution sales included in network system sales prior to fiscal network system sales total solution sales maintenance and related services sales managed services sales total recurring services sales total company sales the company assigns revenues to geographic locations based on the location of the customer 
the company s net sales by geographic area for fiscal years  and were as follows in millions north america central and south america pacific rim europe  middle east and africa total international sales constituted of total company sales in fiscal and and in fiscal total company sales increased in fiscal and declined in fiscal when compared to sales of the preceding year 
the increase in sales in fiscal was comprised of a decrease in solutions sales and a increase in recurring services sales 
the company s fiscal sales of ivr portal solutions grew approximately  but such growth was offset by continuing softness in sales of messaging and payment solutions which decreased approximately as compared to fiscal levels 
the sale of such solutions continues to be affected by the overall decline in the market for telecommunications equipment which the company has experienced over the past two years 
the increase in recurring services sales is made up of growth of approximately in the sales of maintenance and related services and growth of approximately in managed services sales 
managed services sales during fiscal included million relating to services performed for an international managed services customer for which the company recognizes revenue on a cash basis as compared to million of similar sales to the same customer included in fiscal changes in foreign currency exchange rates from fiscal to  including particularly the devaluation of the us dollar as compared to the british pound  served to increase sales for fiscal by approximately million 
changes to such exchange rates between fiscal and had no material effect on fiscal sales 
the decrease in sales in fiscal was comprised of a decrease in solutions sales of approximately and a decline in services sales 
the reduced levels of solutions sales continued to reflect the previously reported sharp declines in the company s primary markets during fiscal and the decline in services sales was primarily attributable to decreased managed service revenues resulting from a decrease in the volume of activity processed under certain of the company s contracts  including  particularly  its contract with o  formerly bt cellnet  offset by growth in the sale of customer support services 

table of contents the company has historically made significant sales of solutions  customer services and managed services to o  formerly bt cellnet 
such combined purchases accounted for  and of the company s total sales during fiscal   and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for or more of the company s sales during fiscal   or the company uses a system combining estimated sales from its recurring services contracts  pipeline of solution sales opportunities  and backlog of committed solution orders to estimate sales and trends in its business 
for the years ended february  and february   sales were sourced as follows year ended february based on averages of quarterly activity sales from recurring service and support contracts  including contracts for managed services sales from solutions backlog sales from the pipeline the company s service and support contracts range in original duration from one month to five years  with most managed service contracts having initial terms of two to three years and most maintenance and related contracts having initial terms of one year 
because many of the longer duration contracts give customers early cancellation privileges  the company does not consider its book of services contracts to be reportable backlog  and a portion of the potential revenue reflected in the contract values may never be realized 
nevertheless  it is easier for the company to estimate service and support sales than to estimate solution sales for the next quarter because the service and support contracts generally span multiple quarters and revenues recognized under each contract are generally similar from one quarter to the next 
the company s backlog is made up of customer orders for solutions for which it has received complete purchase orders and which the company expects to ship within twelve months 
at february   and  the company s backlog of solutions sales was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company s pipeline of opportunities for solutions sales is the aggregation of its sales opportunities  with each opportunity evaluated for the date the potential customer will make a purchase decision  competitive risks  and the potential amount of any resulting sale 
no matter how promising a pipeline opportunity may appear  there is no assurance it will ever result in a sale 
while this pipeline may provide the company some sales guidelines in its business planning and budgeting  pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to solutions revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
while the company knows the amount of solutions backlog available at the beginning of a quarter  it must speculate on its pipeline of solutions opportunities for the quarter 
the company s accuracy in estimating total solutions sales for future fiscal quarters is  therefore  highly dependent upon its ability to successfully estimate which pipeline opportunities will close during the quarter 
the company is prone to quarterly sales fluctuations 
some of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any quarter can cause wide variations in the company s quarterly sales and earnings  as such sales are unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
to compete effectively in its target markets in fiscal and beyond  the company believes it must continue to transition its products and services to an open  standards based business model 
the company has historically provided complete  bundled hardware and software systems using internally developed components to address its customers total business needs 
increasingly  the markets for the company s products are requiring a shift to the development of products and services based on an open  standards based architecture such as the jee and microsoft s 
net environments utilizing voicexml and or salt standards 
such an 
table of contents open  standards based approach allows customers to independently purchase and combine hardware components  standardized software modules  and customization  installation and integration services from individual vendors deemed to offer the best value in the particular class of product or service 
in such an environment  the company believes it may sell less hardware and fewer bundled systems and may become increasingly dependent on its development and sale of software application packages  customized software and consulting and integration services 
this shift will place new challenges on the company s management to transition its products and to hire and retain the mix of personnel necessary to respond to this business environment  to adapt to the changing expense structure that the new environment may tend to foster  and to increase sales of services  customized software and application packages to offset reduced sales of hardware and bundled systems 
special charges fiscal during fiscal  the company incurred severance charges of approximately million in connection with a reduction in workforce affecting positions 
in addition  the company incurred cash and non cash charges totaling approximately million and million  respectively  under the terms of a separation agreement with the company s former chief financial officer who resigned to pursue other opportunities

one of the reductions was associated with the company s 
table of contents consolidation of its separate enterprise and networks divisions into a single  integrated organizational structure 
the charge also included costs associated with the resignation of the networks division president during the first quarter of fiscal costs related to facilities closures included million for the closure of the company s leased facility in chicago  illinois and million associated with the closure of a portion of the company s leased facilities in manchester  united kingdom 
the downsizing of the leased space in manchester followed from the company s decision to consolidate virtually all of its manufacturing operations into its dallas  texas facilities 
the inventory adjustments reflected the company s continued assessment of its inventory levels in light of sales projections  the decision to eliminate the uk manufacturing operation and the consolidation of the business units 
the charges for loss contracts reflected the costs incurred on two contracts which were expected to result in net losses to the company upon completion 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt included million in non cash charges to write off unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issue costs and million in prepayment premiums 
as of february   all cash charges had been paid 
fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed a comprehensive review of the positioning of its product lines  including lines brought forward from its merger with brite  reevaluated its physical plant needs  and reviewed its aggregate staffing levels 
based on these reviews  the company took a number of strategic actions designed to lower costs and streamline product offerings 
as a result of these actions  the company incurred special charges of approximately million  including million for the write down of intangible assets and inventories associated with discontinued product lines  million for the write down of excess inventories  million for severance payments and related benefits  million for facilities closures  and million relating to the write down of non productive fixed assets

the additional writedown of inventories totaling approximately million related to items which the company could continue to use in certain sales situations but which  given the slowdown in market demand  it held in excess quantities at year end 
as part of its fiscal initiatives  the company announced plans to forego expansion into existing leased space in allen  texas and to close its jacksonville  florida and wichita  kansas locations 
as a result of these actions  the company recorded charges of approximately million  including approximately million accrued for future lease commitments and approximately million for accelerated depreciation expense arising from a reassessment of the useful lives of certain related property and equipment 
as part of its overall facilities assessment  the company also identified and wrote off approximately million of 
table of contents fixed assets no longer being used by the company 
the company completed the sale of its wichita  kansas office building on may  the million in gross proceeds was used to pay down amounts outstanding under the company s then outstanding revolving credit facility 
as of february   approximately million of the accrued lease costs remain unpaid 
the severance and related costs recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal were associated with two workforce reductions that affected employees 
as of february   all cash charges had been paid 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million of sales  million of sales and million of sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  the company incurred special charges to cost of goods sold totaling million of sales  million of sales and million of sales  respectively  as described in the preceding special charges section 
the decrease in the cost of goods sold percentage relating to other than special charges for fiscal is attributable to the benefit from the company s cost cutting initiative from the prior year as well as differences in the sales channel mix over the time frames 
the cash basis services revenue recognized during fiscal as compared to fiscal also affected the calculation 
the decrease in the cost of goods sold percentage relating to other than special charges for fiscal is attributable to actions taken by the company to reduce the fixed labor cost component of total cost 
the company reduced manufacturing headcount by from ending fiscal levels  consolidated its manufacturing operations in a single location  and consolidated certain customer service and managed service support centers 
research and development research and development expenses during fiscal  and were approximately million of sales  million of sales  and million of sales  respectively 
the company incurred special charges of million of sales  million of sales and million of sales in fiscal  and  respectively  as described in special charges above 
expenses were down in fiscal and fiscal from prior year levels as a result of the company s cost reduction initiatives and  in fiscal  as a result of the reassignment of certain resources from r d to direct customer service activities cost of goods sold in connection with the company s fiscal reorganization 
recurring research and development expenses included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the company s research and development spending is focused in four key areas 
first  software tools are being developed to aid in the development  deployment and management of customer applications incorporating speech recognition and text to speech technologies 
next  server based software platforms are being developed for runtime services for the management of contact center resources and speech applications 
software platforms are being developed for deployment and management of wireless and wireline network operator applications 
these software platforms are designed to operate in both jee and microsoft s 
net enterprise computing environments 
third  media servers and voice browsers based on open standards such as salt and voicexml are being developed 
finally  the company is developing packaged  speech enabled applications for the network operator and enterprise markets 
these include a range of vertical and horizontal applications that are designed to greatly enhance customer return on investment by providing many commonly used  configurable functions that can be more quickly deployed than custom applications 
the company expects to maintain a strong commitment to research and development to remain at the forefront of technology development in its business markets  which is essential to the continued improvement of the company s position in the industry 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million of sales  million of sales  and million of sales  in fiscal  and  respectively 
such amounts included special charges of million of sales  million of sales and million of sales  respectively  as 
table of contents described in special charges above 
sg a expenses declined in fiscal and from prior year levels primarily as a result of cost control initiatives implemented by the company over the three year period 
amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets in connection with its purchase of brite in fiscal  the company recorded intangible assets and goodwill totaling million 
these assets were assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
for the fiscal years ended february   and  the company recognized amortization and impairment expense related to these assets as follows in millions amortization of goodwill amortization of other acquisition related intangible assets total amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets impairment of other acquisition related intangible assets as described below impairment of goodwill in connection with the impairment of other acquisition related intangible assets as described below total impairment charged to operating income total amortization and impairment charged to operating income impairment of goodwill in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
as described below effective march   the company adopted statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets the statements 
statement no 
refines the definition of what assets may be considered as separately identified intangible assets apart from goodwill 
statement no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis 
in adopting the statements  the company first reclassified million of intangible assets associated with its assembled workforce net of related deferred taxes of million to goodwill because such assets did not meet the new criteria for separate identification 
the company then allocated its adjusted goodwill balance of million to its then existing enterprise and networks divisions and completed the transitional impairment tests required by statement no 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using a combination of the expected present values of future cash flows and an assessment of comparable market values 
as a result of these tests  the company determined that the goodwill associated with its networks division was fully impaired  and  accordingly  it recognized a non cash  goodwill impairment charge of million as the cumulative effect on prior years of this change in accounting principle 
this impairment resulted primarily from the significant decline in networks sales and profitability during the fourth quarter of fiscal and related reduced forecasts for the division s sales and profitability 
effective august   the company combined its divisions into a single integrated organizational structure in order to address changing market demands and global customer requirements 
the company conducted its required annual test of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarters of fiscal and no additional impairment of goodwill was indicated 
accordingly  at february   the company s remaining acquired goodwill totaled million 
during fiscal  the company was adversely affected by continuing softness in the general us economy  by extreme softness in the worldwide network telecommunications market and by political tensions in parts of south america and the middle east 
the company experienced a second year of declining network revenue and significantly reduced its estimates of near term growth in revenue and net income for its networks based products 
as a result  the company determined that a triggering event  as defined in 
table of contents sfas no 
 had occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal and  accordingly  the company evaluated its intangible assets for evidence of impairment 
based on the results of its review  the company recognized impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of its customer relations and developed technology intangible assets to their respective fair values  which were based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed a comprehensive review of the positioning of all product lines  including lines brought forward from its fiscal merger with brite 
as a result of decisions made during that review  the company performed impairment tests in accordance with its stated policies on the brite tradename and on certain of the developed technology associated with the brite acquisition 
based on these tests  the company recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of these intangible assets and an additional charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with the impaired assets 
at february   the company had million in net intangible assets other than goodwill which will be subject to amortization in future periods 
the estimated amortization expense attributable to the company s intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter other income expense other income expense during fiscal  and was comprised primarily of interest income on cash and cash equivalents  foreign currency transaction losses totaling approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and a foreign currency transaction gain of approximately million in fiscal interest expense the company incurred interest expense of approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
substantially all of this expense relates to the company s long term borrowings initially obtained in connection with the brite merger and subsequently refinanced see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the company s long term borrowings 
the reduction in interest expense from fiscal through fiscal is primarily attributable to the lower levels of debt outstanding in successive years  partially offset in fiscal by additional costs arising from the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with financings undertaken during that year 
borrowings under all credit agreements totaled million  million and million at february   and  respectively 
assuming principal payments in accordance with the company s existing financing agreements and interest rates consistent with current market rates  the company expects its fiscal interest expense to be approximately million 
from july through october  the company used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variability of interest payments on its then existing variable rate credit facilities 
while in effect  the swap arrangements essentially converted the company s outstanding floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
of the million total interest expense in fiscal  approximately million was attributable to net settlements under the interest rate swap arrangements 
the company terminated its swap arrangements in october in response to the continued downward movement in interest rates during fiscal and had no derivative contracts in place as of february  and 
table of contents income taxes the company s income tax expense for fiscal totaled million or of pretax income 
this percentage differs from the us statutory rate of primarily as a result of the taxability in the us of certain dividends deemed to have been received from the company s foreign subsidiaries  the use of certain fully reserved net operating losses carried forward from prior years and the favorable resolution of certain tax contingencies and amounts payable for foreign taxes 
the company s income tax benefit for fiscal and as a percent of pretax loss also differs significantly from the federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of benefits recognized in fiscal as a result of a change in us tax law  operating losses and credit carryforwards generated but not benefited  non deductible amortization of goodwill resulting from the merger with brite  and various us tax credits 
the company s us taxable income for fiscal included distributions deemed to have been made to the company as an us entity from several of its foreign subsidiaries  including  particularly  its uk subsidiary 
such deemed distributions stemmed from the existence of intercompany debt owed by the us entity to certain of its foreign subsidiaries and from the pledging of certain uk assets as collateral for the company s term loan which was outstanding for a portion of the year 
during fiscal  the company used net operating losses carried forward from previous years to reduce its current taxes payable in the us the use of these losses and the related reversal of previously established valuation allowances associated with the loss carryforwards reduced the company s us and consolidated tax provisions for fiscal and also gave rise to million in credits to equity for portions of the loss carryforwards related to stock option and other equity issues 
during fiscal  the company reached final settlement with the internal revenue service regarding previously disclosed audits of the company s federal income tax returns for its fiscal years and in the settlement  the company lost the ability to carry back approximately million in net operating losses generated in fiscal and repaid approximately million of refunds previously received from the irs plus approximately million in accrued interest 
the final settlements had been anticipated in the company s fiscal net tax provision and had no material effect on the tax provision or net income for fiscal during fiscal  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  brite voice systems  inc brite  reached final settlement with the irs regarding a disputed notice of deficiency relating to brite s august federal income tax return 
as a result of the settlement  the company reversed approximately million of taxes payable it had accrued in prior years in response to the irs challenge 
during fiscal  united states tax law was amended to allow companies which incurred net operating losses in and to carry such losses back a maximum of five years instead of the maximum of two years previously allowed 
as a result of this change  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company used million of its previously reported net operating loss carryforwards and million of its previously reported tax credit carryforwards and recognized a one time tax benefit of million  of which million was recognized as additional capital associated with previous stock option exercises 
also during fiscal  the company became aware of the audit issues described above associated with its fiscal and us tax returns and recorded a charge of approximately million as part of its tax provision for the year 
in fiscal  the company did not provide a valuation allowance for deferred assets associated with its foreign subsidiaries 
in providing such a reserve during fiscal  the company recognized tax expense totaling million to increase the valuation allowance for net foreign deferred tax assets that existed at february  also during fiscal  and as further discussed in note c to the company s consolidated financial statements  the company reduced its deferred tax liabilities by million in connection with the reclassification of its assembled workforce intangible asset to goodwill 
as a result of this transaction  the company increased the valuation allowance associated with its us net deferred tax asset by million 
at february   the company had us net operating loss carryforwards totaling million 
this amount  if not used  will expire in at february   the company also had million  million and million in us research and development  foreign tax credit and alternative minimum tax 
table of contents credit carryforwards  respectively  and million in uk foreign tax credit carryforwards 
if unused  the r d tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in  and the foreign tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in during fiscal and fiscal  the company established a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets  including its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
although the company earned a profit in fiscal and was able to use some previously reserved net operating loss carryforwards  the company believes the existence of losses in its us operations in recent years and the dependency of its international subsidiaries on continuing us operations prevent it from concluding that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized 
this is a highly subjective assessment and requires the company to evaluate the predictability of future taxable income while considering the significant losses the company incurred in fiscal and in general  the company does not anticipate reversing valuation allowances associated with deferred tax assets of its us and us operations until the earlier of the time that the underlying deferred tax assets are realized or the time at which the respective taxable entities actual results have demonstrated a sustained profitability and their projected results support the company s ability to realize the deferred tax assets currently being reserved 
income loss from operations and net income loss the company generated income from operations of million and net income of million during fiscal its loss from operations  loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and net loss totaled million  million and million  respectively in fiscal in fiscal  the company generated an operating loss of million and a net loss of million 
during fiscal  and  the company incurred special charges  as previously described in this item  totaling million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  the company benefited from a change in the us federal tax law that allowed it to recognize net tax benefits of approximately million 
in fiscal  the company combined improvements in the overall economic environment  improving markets for its ivr portal products  the company s focus on speech solutions and open architecture  the company s focus on its recurring services offerings and its multi year efforts to reduce operating cost and enhance efficiency to produce a return to profitability 
the company s losses in fiscal and fiscal were primarily attributable to the significant decline in the company s sales volumes from levels and to the significant restructuring and other special charges incurred by the company in its efforts to adjust its operations to the rapidly changing market for its products 
while the company benefited throughout fiscal and from the cumulative effect of these efforts  its aggregate costs were too high to allow the company to operate profitably in these years in the face of the sharp downturn in sales activity 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on prior years associated with the company s adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a charge to income in fiscal of million 
assuming the accounting change had been applied retroactively by the company to prior periods  pro forma net loss for fiscal would have been million  and net loss per common share would have been

table of contents at february   the company s outstanding long term debt was comprised of the following in millions february  mortgage loan  bearing interest payable monthly at the greater of or the prime rate plus  principal due may  revolving line of credit  interest payable monthly  accruing at a rate equal to the prime rate plus or at the london inter bank offering rate plus  at february   line of credit expires january  the following table provides information about the company s credit agreements that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the credit agreements  the table presents cash flows for scheduled principal payments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect as of february  fiscal dollars in millions long term debt variable rate us projected weighted average interest rate foreign currency risks the company transacts business in certain foreign currencies including  particularly  the british pound and the euro 
the company s primary software application development  research and development and other administrative activities are conducted from offices in the united states and the united kingdom  and its primary manufacturing operations are conducted in the united states 
virtually all sales arranged through the company s us offices are denominated in us dollars  which is the functional and reporting currency of the us entity 
sales arranged through the company s uk subsidiary are denominated in various currencies  including the british pound  the us dollar and the euro  however  the us subsidiary s functional currency is the british pound 
for the fiscal year ended february   sales originating from the company s uk subsidiary represented approximately of consolidated sales 
as a result of its international operations  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
the company has not historically used foreign currency options or forward contracts to hedge its currency exposures because of variability in the timing of cash flows associated with its larger contracts and it did not have any such hedge instruments in place at february  rather  the company attempts to mitigate its foreign currency risk by generally transacting business in the functional currency of each of its major subsidiaries  thus creating natural hedges by paying expenses incurred in the local currency in which revenues will be received 
as noted above  the company s operating results are exposed to changes in certain exchange rates including  particularly  those between the us dollar  the british pound and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against the other currencies  the company s sales are negatively affected upon the translation of uk operating results to the reporting currency 
the effect of these changes on the company s operating profits varies depending on the level of british pound denominated expenses and the uk subsidiary s overall profitability 
for the fiscal year ended february   the result of a hypothetical  uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound and the euro would have been a decrease in sales of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and or operating expenses  changes in exchange rates also could affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices
