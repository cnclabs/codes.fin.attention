item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction and overview this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the company s operating performance and its financial condition 
a discussion of the company s business  including its strategy  products and competition is included in part i of this form k 
the company s results of operations and financial condition may be affected by a variety of factors 
in management s opinion  the most significant of these factors include the economic strength of the technology markets into which the company sells its products  the ability of the company to develop compelling technology solutions and deliver these to the marketplace in a timely manner  and the actions of competitors 
these significant factors are discussed further below 
the markets that the company serves are very diverse and include a cross section of the technology industries 
accordingly  the company s business is cyclical and tends to correlate to the overall performance of the technology sector 
during fiscal years and  the company experienced considerable growth and profitability resulting from the overall growth in the technology markets and successful new product introductions 
however  the company began to experience weakening demand in the latter part of fiscal year and subsequently experienced a dramatic decline in demand during fiscal year during fiscal year  the company s product orders declined from fiscal year the technology markets continued to be depressed into fiscal year during the latter part of fiscal year  the company began to experience the stabilization of certain markets 
fiscal year saw a broader based recovery in the technology sector from the downturn of preceding years 
during fiscal years and  the company engaged in a variety of efforts to reduce the cost structure to better align to the lower sales levels 
these costs continued to be incurred into fiscal year as many of the actions identified took considerable time to execute 
in addition to incurring costs to realign the company s cost structure during fiscal year and  the company also incurred costs to restructure the operations of the japan subsidiary acquired through acquisition of sony tektronix corporation and also recognized certain costs and credits directly associated with the integration of this subsidiary 
the company faces significant competition in many of the markets in which it sells its products 
the company competes on many factors including product performance  technology  product availability and price 
to compete effectively  the company must deliver compelling products to the market in a timely manner 
accordingly  the company makes significant investments into the research and development of new products and the selling channels necessary to deliver products to the market 
even during periods where economic conditions have reduced the company s revenues  such as those experienced in fiscal years and  the company continued to invest significantly in the development of new products and selling channels 
a discussion of the company s competitors and products is included in item of this form k 
a component of the company s strategy includes focusing investments in certain product categories to expand its existing market positions 
expansion in these certain product categories may come through internal growth or from acquisitions 
on june   the company announced the signing of a definitive agreement to purchase inet 
this acquisition is anticipated to close during in the second quarter of fiscal year subsequent to the close of this transaction  the company must integrate the operation of inet into the operations of the company

inet s products address next generation networks  including g and g mobile data and voice over packet also referred to as voice over internet protocol or voip technologies  and traditional networks 
inet has approximately employees worldwide and had sales of million 
when combined with tektronix mobile protocol test business  tektronix will be one of the largest global providers of these solutions 
tektronix anticipates that the acquisition will accelerate the delivery of products and solutions for network operators and equipment manufacturers seeking to implement next generation technologies such as general packet radio service gprs  universal mobile telecommunications systems umts and voip 
tektronix will acquire all of inet s outstanding stock for approximately per share consisting of per share in cash and approximately per share in tektronix common stock 
the stock portion of the consideration is subject to a percent collar 
the midpoint of the percent collar is per share  which represents the average closing price of tektronix common stock during the trading days prior to the announcement of the transaction on june  since the number of shares of tektronix common stock to be issued will not be known until shortly before the completion of the transaction  the measurement date for the valuation of the shares of tektronix common stock  for accounting purposes  has not yet been determined 
as of march   inet had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding

subsequent to the close of this transaction  this subsidiary is referred to as tektronix japan within this management discussion and analysis 
this transaction is a long term strategic investment that will provide the company stronger access to the japanese market and the ability to leverage the engineering resources in japan 
prior to the redemption  the company accounted for its investment in sony tektronix under the equity method 
prior to the close of this transaction  the sony tektronix entity entered into an agreement to borrow up to billion yen  or approximately million at an interest rate of above the tokyo inter bank offering rate tibor

sale of optical parametric test business the optical parametric test business was acquired in april for million 
the purchase included million of intangible assets  million of other net assets and million of goodwill 
the optical parametric test business was a technology innovator in optical test and measurement components 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  management approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of its optical parametric test business 
this business was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  the results of operations of the optical parametric test business have been excluded from continuing operations and recorded as discontinued operations 
the net carrying value of assets  primarily goodwill and other intangible assets  was adjusted to estimated selling price less costs to sell which resulted in a million write down  net of income tax benefit of million  included in loss on sale of the optical parametric test business in the third quarter of fiscal year the market for optical parametric test equipment was dramatically affected by the economic conditions that negatively impacted many technology sectors  which began in the second half of fiscal year and continued into fiscal year see additional discussion under the economic conditions section in results of operations in management s discussion and analysis below 
the reduction in the value of the optical parametric test business during the period it was owned by the company was a direct result of the impact of these economic conditions 
on may   the company sold its optical parametric test business for million 
the company recognized an additional loss on the sale of million  net of income tax benefit of million  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year loss from discontinued operations during the current fiscal year includes an additional net loss from the sale of the optical parametric test business due to settlement of additional costs arising after the sale 
sale of gage applied sciences during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  management of the company approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of gage applied sciences gage  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
gage  located in montreal  canada  produced pc based instruments products 
the divestiture of this entity was consistent with the company s strategy of concentrating its resources in core product areas and de emphasizing products which are determined to be less strategic 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company sold the operations of gage to a third party 
this business has been accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
the company recorded an after tax loss of million during the first quarter of fiscal year to reflect adjustments to the previously estimated after tax loss of million on the disposition of this discontinued operation which was recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal year to write down the net assets  primarily goodwill  of gage to net realizable value less estimated selling costs 
business realignment costs business realignment costs represent actions to realign the company s cost structure in response to significant events and primarily include restructuring actions and impairment of assets resulting from reduced business levels 
business realignment actions taken during fiscal year and in fiscal years and were intended to reduce the company s worldwide cost structure across all major functions in response to the dramatic economic decline  which severely impacted markets into which the company sells its products 
major operations impacted include manufacturing  engineering  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
in addition to severance  the company incurred other costs associated with restructuring its organization  which primarily represent facilities contracts and other exit costs associated with aligning the cost structure to appropriate levels 
the company anticipates that the actions taken have or will result in reduced operating costs in periods following the period in which the costs were incurred  primarily through reductions in labor costs 
management believes that the restructuring actions implemented in fiscal years  and have resulted in the costs savings anticipated for those actions 
costs incurred during fiscal year primarily related to restructuring actions planned by the company during fiscal year  which were executed in fiscal year many of the restructuring actions planned by the company take significant time to execute  particularly if they are being conducted in countries outside the united states 
the company anticipates incurring significantly lower levels of business realignment costs in fiscal year  as most of the previously planned actions have been executed 
business realignment costs of million during fiscal year included million of severance related costs for employees mostly located in europe and adjustments to estimates in prior years  million for accumulated currency translation losses  net  related to the substantial closure of subsidiaries in brazil  australia and denmark and a surplus facility in china  million for contractual obligations for leased facilities in europe and the united states  and million for accelerated depreciation and write down of assets in europe and the united states 
expected future annual salary cost savings from actions taken during fiscal year to reduce employee headcount are estimated to be million 
at may   remaining liabilities of million  million and million for employee severance and related benefits for actions taken in fiscal years  and  respectively  were maintained for  and employees  respectively 
the company incurred million of business realignment costs in fiscal year for employee severance  impairment of an intangible asset  a facility lease obligation and closure of other facilities 
the company incurred million of severance and related costs for the termination of employees resulting from actions to align the company s cost structure with the reduced sales levels resulting from the recent economic conditions discussed above  actions taken to align the cost structure of tektronix japan and adjustments to estimates in prior years 
these severance costs included million for former employees of tektronix japan and million for pension curtailment and settlement losses for the employees terminated in japan 
an impairment charge of million was recognized to write down an intangible asset for acquired bluetooth technology 
the closure of certain foreign and domestic operations resulted in credits totaling million for accumulated translation gains and million primarily for other asset write downs and contractual obligations 
the company reversed million for a facility lease obligation due to the sale of the company s optical transmission test product line in the second quarter of fiscal year the company accrued million during fiscal year associated with the exiting of facilities previously utilized for optical transmission test

activity for the above described actions during fiscal year was as follows balance may  costs incurred cash payments non cash adjustments balance may  in thousands fiscal year actions employee severance and related benefits asset impairments contractual obligations accumulated currency translation loss total fiscal year actions employee severance and related benefits asset impairments contractual obligations total fiscal year actions employee severance and related benefits contractual obligations total other total of all actions critical accounting estimates management has identified the company s critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the financial condition and operating results of the company and require difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses include contingencies  intangible asset valuation  inventory valuation  pension plan assumptions and the assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies 
contingencies the company is subject to claims and litigation concerning intellectual property  environmental and employment issues  and settlement of contingencies related to prior dispositions of assets 
accruals have been established based upon management s best estimate of the ultimate outcome of these matters 
the company reviews the status of its claims  litigation and other contingencies on a regular basis and adjustments are made as information becomes available 
as of may   the company had million of contingencies recorded in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  which included million of contingencies relating to the sale of cpid  million for environmental exposures and million for other contingent liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of contingencies could change in the near term and that such changes could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
at the time of the sale of cpid on january   the company deferred the recognition of million of gain on sale and recorded contingencies of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  it is the company s policy to defer recognition of a gain where it is believed that contingencies exist that may result in that gain being recognized prior to realization 
the company analyzes the amount of deferred gain in relation to outstanding contingencies  and recognizes additional gain when objective evidence indicates that such contingencies are believed to be resolved 
the million of contingencies represents the deferral of a portion of the gain on sale that management of the company believed was not realizable due to certain contingencies contained in the final sale agreement 
of the original million of contingencies  million has been utilized to settle claims and million was recognized in subsequent periods 
as of may  and may   the balance of the contingencies related to the cpid disposition was million  a significant portion of which may take several years to resolve 
the company continues to monitor the status of the cpid related contingencies based on information received 
if unforeseen events or circumstances arise subsequent to the balance sheet date  changes in the estimate of these contingencies could be material to the financial statements 
for additional discussion of the cpid related contingencies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
included in contingent liabilities is million specifically associated with the closure and cleanup of a licensed hazardous waste management facility at the company s beaverton  oregon campus 
the company established the initial liability in and bases ongoing estimates on currently available facts and presently enacted laws and regulations 
costs for tank removal and cleanup were incurred in fiscal year costs currently being incurred primarily relate to ongoing monitoring and testing of the site 
management s best estimate of the range of remaining reasonably possible cost associated with this environmental cleanup  testing and monitoring could be as high as million 
management believes that the recorded liability represents the low end of the range 
these costs are estimated to be incurred over the next several years 
if events or circumstances arise that are unforeseen to the company as of the balance sheet date  actual costs could differ materially from this estimate 
the remaining million of contingency accruals include amounts related to intellectual property and employment issues  as well as contingencies related to dispositions of assets other than cpid 
if events or circumstances arise that are unforeseen to the company as of the balance sheet date  actual costs could differ materially from this estimate 
intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as of may   the company had million of goodwill  net recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal year and identified no impairment 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future market share and revenues and costs for the reporting units as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
however  if the company fails to deliver new products for these reporting units  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and the company may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
during fiscal year  management approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of its optical parametric test business 
this business was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the results of operations of the optical parametric test business have been excluded from continuing operations and recorded as discontinued operations 
the net carrying value of assets  primarily goodwill and other intangible assets  was adjusted to estimated selling price less costs to sell which resulted in a million write down  net of income tax benefit of million  included in loss on sale of the optical parametric test business in fiscal year the optical parametric test business was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  management approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of gage 
this business was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the results of operations of gage have been excluded from continuing operations and recorded as discontinued operations 
the company recognized an impairment charge in discontinued operations of million  net of income tax benefit of million  in fiscal year to write down the net assets  primarily for goodwill  of gage to net realizable value less estimated selling costs 
the operations of gage were sold in the first quarter of fiscal year for intangible assets with definite useful lives  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful lives and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
as of may   the company had million of non goodwill intangible assets recorded in other long term assets  which includes patents and licenses for certain technology 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to impair these assets 
the impairment would be based on the estimated discounted cash flow associated with each asset 
impairment could result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  the company fails to deliver new products related to these technology assets  the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable 
during fiscal year  the company impaired an intangible asset related to acquired bluetooth technology resulting in an expense of million  which is included in business realignment costs in the consolidated statements of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on currently adjusted standard costs  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment totaling million as of may  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items 
these write downs reduce the inventory value of these obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
such estimates may become difficult to make under volatile economic and market conditions as the write down is based on current and forecasted demand 
therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
in addition  excessive amounts of used equipment in the marketplace can negatively impact the net realizable value of the company s demonstration equipment 
if actual market conditions are different than anticipated  the company may incur additional charges for impairment of inventory in the period in which more information becomes available 
the company recorded charges for inventory obsolescence of approximately million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the considerably larger write down in fiscal year was due to the large and unanticipated decrease in fiscal year sales volumes when compared with prior year sales volumes 
pension plans the company maintains certain defined benefit pension plans to provide pension benefits to employees in certain countries 
the largest of the company s pension plans is the cash balance plan in the united states 
effective august   the us cash balance plan will not be offered to new employees hired after july  as a result of the acquisition of the sony tektronix joint venture  the company had a significant defined benefit pension plan in japan which was substantially settled in the second quarter of fiscal year the company maintains less significant defined benefit plans in other countries including the united kingdom  germany  holland and taiwan 
effective september   the company substantially settled its liability for the existing defined benefit pension plans in japan and established new plans to provide retirement benefits to japan employees 
the settlement and curtailment of the existing defined benefit plans were made in accordance with the applicable plan provisions and local statutory requirements 
the company has established a defined contribution plan as the principal plan to provide retirement benefits to employees in japan 
local regulations limit the benefit that the company can provide to an individual employee through use of a defined contribution plan 
to the extent the company provides retirement benefits to an individual in an amount greater than that allowed  the excess will be reflected as a benefit in a newly created defined benefit pension plan 
as the amount of statutory limit for benefits under the defined contribution plan increases  benefits provided through the defined benefit component will decrease 
the impact of the settlement and curtailment of the existing defined benefit pension plans and initial funding of the new defined contribution plan was as follows defined benefit plans defined contribution plan total in thousands reduction increase in pension liability  net write off of pension asset for unrecognized prior service cost reduction in minimum pension charge in accumulated other comprehensive loss deferred income taxes on minimum pension charge net pension curtailment and settlement gain the increase of million for the new defined contribution plan  was necessary to adjust the initial liability for future funding of the new defined contribution plan to million effective september  as of may   the balance of this funding commitment was million  which will be paid in annual installments through february benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future and therefore are subject to certain estimates 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
the accounting standards require that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on the assets of the plan and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations 
the company applies the long term rate of return on plan assets assumption to a market related value of plan assets to estimate income recognized by the pension plan assets 
this income from return on pension assets is a component of net periodic pension cost 
the cost components of net periodic pension costs primarily include the interest cost on participants accumulated benefits  service cost for benefits earned during the period and the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses 
the income component of net periodic pension cost is primarily driven by the amount of return on plan assets recorded by the company 
in prior periods  the income recognized on plan assets has exceeded the periodic pension costs  thereby resulting in net pension income being recognized by the company 
the amount of income recognized is affected by the rate of return assumption employed and the amount of plan assets that the return assumption is applied to 
the amount of net pension income recognized by the company has declined from prior periods due primarily to the company beginning to amortize previously unrecognized losses on the decline in value of plan assets  decline in the return on plan assets assumption employed by the company  reduction in the market related value of the plan assets  and increased pension costs due to a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension benefits see discount rate discussion below 
in prior periods  net periodic pension income recognized by the company has differed materially from the actual experience of the plan assets and liabilities 
as of may   the company had recorded an unrecognized loss of million  net of income tax benefit of million  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet as a result of the additional minimum pension liability discussed below 
to the extent this unrecognized loss is not offset by future unrecognized gains  there will continue to be a negative impact to net earnings as this amount is amortized to net periodic pension cost 
the company s estimated weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets for fiscal year was approximately 
a one percent change in the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a change in operating income of million for fiscal year  which excludes the impact of assets in the benefit plans in japan that were settled during the year 
assumed discount rates are used in measurements of the projected  accumulated  and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost 
management makes estimates of discount rates to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making those estimates  management evaluates rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the weighted average of discount rates used in determining the company s pension obligation as of may  was 
at may   the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets for certain pension plans 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  a minimum pension liability was recognized for the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
recognition of an additional minimum liability is required if an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation exists and a an asset has been recognized as prepaid pension cost  b the liability already recognized as unfunded accrued pension cost is less than the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation  or c no accrued or prepaid pension cost has been recognized 
the company has recognized an additional minimum liability in accordance with sfas no 
since the additional minimum liability exceeded unrecognized prior service cost  the excess which would represent a net loss not yet recognized as net periodic pension cost is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of applicable income tax benefit 
the company initially recorded an additional pension liability at the end of fiscal year  the first measurement date where the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
as of may   the cumulative additional minimum pension charge included in accumulated other comprehensive loss was million  net of income tax benefit of million 
the implication of the additional minimum pension liability is that it may reduce net income in future years by reducing the market related value of plan assets  thereby reducing the asset base upon which the company recognizes a return 
the company may find it necessary to fund additional pension assets  which would increase the market related value of plan assets upon which the company recognizes a return but would reduce operating cash and future interest earnings on that cash 
subsequent to the current fiscal year  the company made a voluntary contribution of million to the us cash balance plan in june management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
net pension expense was million in fiscal year  which included the effect of the recognition of service cost  interest cost  the assumed return on plan assets and amortization of a portion of the unrecognized loss noted above 
net pension income or expense is allocated to cost of sales  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes the company is subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and is based on the best information available at the time 
the actual income tax liabilities to the jurisdictions with respect to any fiscal year are ultimately determined long after the financial statements have been published 
the company maintains reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
significant income tax exposures include potential challenges of research and experimentation credits  export related tax benefits  disposition transactions and intercompany pricing 
exposures are settled primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause management of the company to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the liabilities are frequently reviewed for their adequacy and appropriateness 
as of may   the company was subject to income tax audits for fiscal years  and the liabilities associated with these years will ultimately be resolved when events such as the completion of audits by the taxing jurisdictions occur 
to the extent the audits or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimates  the effect would be recognized in income tax expense benefit in the consolidated statement of operations in the period of the event 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
as of may   the company had established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  primarily foreign tax credit carryforwards 
during fiscal year  the valuation allowance decreased by million due to expected utilization of foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the company has not established valuation allowances against other deferred tax assets based on tax strategies planned to mitigate the risk of impairment to these assets 
accordingly  if the company s facts or financial results were to change thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance required to be in place on the financial statements in any given period 
the company continually evaluates strategies that could allow the future utilization of its deferred tax assets

in addition  the sony tektronix redemption was effective on september  accordingly  the company did not consolidate the results of the japan subsidiary during the first quarter of the prior fiscal year  and consolidated only two months of the second quarter of the prior fiscal year 
for the remainder of fiscal year and during the current fiscal year  the results of the japan subsidiary were consolidated in all months 
as a result  balances for fiscal year in the consolidated statements of operations are higher due in part to the consolidation of more operating periods 
economic conditions beginning in the second half of fiscal year  and continuing through fiscal year  economic conditions had a significant negative impact on many markets into which the company sold products including  but not limited to  optical design and manufacturing  mobile handset manufacturing  automated test equipment  telecommunications and semiconductor design and manufacturing 
during fiscal year  these economic conditions continued to affect many of the markets into which the company sold products  although the impact was less severe than in prior years and certain markets appeared to begin to stabilize towards the end of that fiscal year 
from a geographical perspective  the company began to see the economic environment stabilize in the united states and japan 
the stabilization of certain markets that began at the end of fiscal year continued into fiscal year during fiscal year  the company continued to experience a phased recovery of its end markets  with growth across all regions and most product lines throughout the current fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that the company s underlying end markets will continue to improve or that the recent increased levels of business activity will continue as a trend into the future 
in response to the reduced level of orders and associated sales in fiscal year and  the company incurred significant business realignment costs 
the company continued to incur business realignment costs during fiscal year to further reduce the company s cost structure in order to provide an amount of operating income that management believed was appropriate at the current sales levels 
many of the costs incurred during fiscal year were associated with actions that were identified during prior fiscal years  but for which sufficient action had not yet been taken to support the recognition of the associated expense 
many of the business realignment actions planned by the company take significant time to execute  particularly if they are being conducted in countries outside the united states 
discontinuation of rohde and schwarz distribution agreement on march   the company announced the discontinuation of an existing distribution agreement with rohde and schwarz  under which the company served as the exclusive distributor for rohde and schwarz communication test products in the united states and canada 
the discontinuation of this distribution agreement was effective june  the company had served in this distribution role for rohde and schwarz since october during fiscal year and  the company generated revenue of million and million  respectively  from rohde and schwarz distributed products 
as of may   the company had product backlog of approximately million related to rohde and schwarz distributed product 
the company anticipates that substantially all of this backlog will be shipped and subsequently recognized as revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year as the company was merely a distributor of these products  the corresponding sales generated lower gross margins compared to sales of products manufactured by the company 
during fiscal year and  gross margins on these distribution sales were and  respectively 
the company incurred selling  general and administrative expenses in connection with its efforts to distribute these products 
for fiscal years and  distribution of these products resulted in a nominal loss on a fully allocated basis 
as a result of the discontinuation of this distribution agreement  the company has reduced and redirected selling  general and administrative resources in response to the related reduction in gross profit 
product orders product orders consist of cancelable commitments to purchase currently produced products by customers with delivery scheduled generally within six months of being recorded 
during fiscal year  product orders increased million or from the prior year 
the growth in product orders was primarily driven by strength in the overall markets  demonstrated by year over year growth in all of the company s product categories and geographical regions 
additional factors contributing to the growth included good response to new products  the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  and the consolidation of four more months of results from the company s japan subsidiary during fiscal year as compared with the prior fiscal year 
geographically  product orders increased in the united states and internationally 
from a regional perspective  growth in international regions was primarily driven by japan  which grew approximately and europe  which grew approximately 
the growth in the japan region was driven by growth in the local economy  the consolidation of the japan subsidiary for more periods during the current fiscal year  as discussed above  good response to new products and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the growth in the europe region was driven partially by the stabilization of certain economies and markets within that region as well as good response to new products  but also from the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates was attributable for total year over year growth of approximately million  or  mostly attributable to currency fluctuation in european and japan 
growth in the united states was driven by the continued economic recovery of the markets into which the company sells its products 
during fiscal years and  the company generated product orders of million and million  respectively  from distribution of rohde and schwarz products 
as noted above  the company discontinued acting as the distributor of these products in the united states and canada effective june  the year over year growth from the distribution of these products was primarily in the united states 
net sales consolidated net sales during fiscal year increased million  or  over the previous year 
international net sales increased compared to the prior fiscal year  while net sales in the united states increased 
the increase in net sales in both the united states and internationally was primarily due to increased product orders in these geographies during fiscal year  as discussed above 
the increase in net sales attributable to higher product orders was partially offset by the increase in product backlog in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
in the current fiscal year  the company increased product backlog by million as compared with a million increase in product backlog in the prior fiscal year 
in addition to product sales  net sales also include revenues from service and component sales 
as noted above  during the current fiscal year the company increased product backlog  and therefore the increase in product orders was greater than the increase in product sales 
the geographical distribution of sales is directly correlated to the geographical distribution of orders 
however  as the company increases or decreases the level of product backlog within any given fiscal year  this direct correlation may vary 
product backlog at may  was million  an increase of million from product backlog of million at may  ending product backlog as of may  was approximately weeks of product sales 
product backlog levels are affected by the timing of product orders received within the quarter 
the company maintains a general target for product backlog levels of to weeks of product sales 
during fiscal years and  the company generated revenue of million and million respectively  from rohde and schwarz distributed products and had related product backlog of approximately million as of may  as noted above  the company discontinued acting as the distributor of these products in the united states and canada effective june gross profit and gross margin gross profit for fiscal year was million  an increase of million from gross profit of million for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was attributable to the increase in sales volume during the current fiscal year as well as the increase in gross margin on those sales 
gross margin is the measure of gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross margin for fiscal year was  an increase of points over the prior year gross margin of 
gross margin is affected by a variety of factors including  among other items  sales volumes  mix of product shipments  product pricing  inventory impairments and other costs such as warranty repair and sustaining engineering 
the improvement in gross margin during the current fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes  which spread additional revenue over a partially fixed manufacturing cost structure  and favorable mix resulting from the shipment of higher margin products 
also contributing to the year over year increase was the positive impact of the company s explicit program to increase gross margin  whereby the company reviewed all cost drivers within gross margin and created a focused effort on reducing these costs where appropriate 
additionally  gross margin was also impacted by consolidation of four more months of the japan operations in the current fiscal year as compared with the prior year 
during fiscal year and  gross margins on rohde and schwarz distribution sales were and  respectively 
as noted above  the company discontinued acting as the distributor of these products in the united states and canada effective june  operating expenses in the current fiscal year  operating expenses included research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  business realignment costs  net acquisition related credits and costs and net gains and losses from the sale of fixed assets 
in prior years  operating expenses included the company s portion of the income or loss of sony tektronix classified as equity in business ventures loss in the consolidated statement of operations 
as noted above  this former joint venture is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and therefore the operating results are consolidated 
each of these categories of operating expenses is discussed further below 
it should be noted that although a portion of operating expenses is variable and therefore will fluctuate with operating levels  many costs are fixed in nature and are therefore subject to increase due to inflation and annual labor cost increases 
additionally  the company must continue to invest in the development of new products and the infrastructure to market and sell those products even during periods where operating results reflect only nominal growth  are flat or declining 
accordingly  as the company makes cost reductions in response to changes in business levels or other specific business events  these reductions can be partially or wholly offset by these other increases to the fixed cost structure 
research and development expenses are incurred for the design and testing of new products  technologies and processes  including pre production prototypes  models and tools 
such costs include labor and employee benefits  contract services  materials  equipment and facilities 
research and development expenses increased million  or  during fiscal year as compared with the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher labor related expense and elevated levels of spending on new product development  as well as the impact of consolidating four more months of the japan operations in the current fiscal year as compared with the prior year 
labor related spending increased approximately million  of which million was associated with increased variable incentive expense 
the remaining difference is the net effect of annual salary increases offset by reduced headcount and one less week of operations in the current fiscal year 
the company continuously invests in the development of new products and technologies  and the timing of these costs varies depending on the stage of the development process 
at times  the company may focus certain engineering resources on the maintenance of the current product portfolio  sustaining engineering  which is expensed in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the current year the company used proportionally more of these engineering resources in new product development  thereby increasing research and development expense 
additionally  the company incurred higher expenses associated with engineering materials as a result of the current projects stages of development 
as the company was a distributor of rohde and schwarz products  there was no research and development expense associated with the sale of these products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or in the current fiscal year as compared with the prior year 
this increase in sg a was primarily attributable to increased labor related expense  increased sales commissions and additional expense associated with the consolidation of the japan subsidiary for more periods in the current fiscal year than in the prior year 
labor related expense increased approximately million  primarily driven by million of higher variable incentives expense as well as additional increases for annual salary raises 
these increases were partially offset by cost savings of million from headcount reduction actions as well as savings associated with one less week in the current fiscal year as compared with the prior fiscal year 
sales commissions increased million over the prior year as a result of the increased order rate in the current fiscal year as discussed above 
the consolidation of the japan subsidiary for more periods in the current fiscal year resulted in approximately million of additional sg a expense 
as noted above  the company incurred selling  general and administrative expenses to distribute rohde and schwarz produced products 
these costs included direct expenses to market and sell these products as well as the allocation of corporate overhead 
upon discontinuation of this distribution agreement  the company has reduced and redirected selling  general and administrative expenses in response to the related reduction in gross profit 
equity in business venture s loss in fiscal year represented the company s share of net loss from the sony tektronix joint venture 
the company completed the acquisition of sony tektronix in the second quarter of fiscal year and results subsequent to the acquisition date have been consolidated in the operating results of the company 
business realignments costs represent actions to realign the company s cost structure in response to dramatic changes in operating levels or a significant acquisition or divestiture 
these costs primarily comprise severance costs for reductions in employee headcount and costs associated with the closure of facilities and subsidiaries 
in recent years  business realignment costs have primarily been associated with the realignment of the company s cost structure in response to the dramatic economic decline experienced in the technology sector beginning during fiscal years  and continuing into fiscal year  as well as restructuring costs associated with the company s acquisition of sony tektronix 
in many cases  and especially in foreign countries  these actions may take significant time to execute 
accordingly  the company has continued to experience business realignment costs throughout fiscal year for actions planned in response to the reductions in operating levels experienced in fiscal year and during fiscal year the company incurred business realignment costs of million  a reduction from expense of million in the prior fiscal year 
the reduction from the prior year is the result of the previously planned actions being executed and recognized with fewer additional actions needing to be planned as business levels stabilized 
business realignment costs associated with the acquisition of sony tek were million in fiscal year for severance related costs and million in fiscal year which included million for severance related costs and million for pension curtailment and settlement losses for former employees 
for a full description of the components of business realignment costs please refer to the business realignment costs section above in this management discussion and analysis 
acquisition related credits costs  net included incremental credits and costs incurred as a direct result of the integration of significant acquisitions 
the acquisition related credits and costs for fiscal years and are solely related to the company s acquisition of sony tektronix discussed above 
during fiscal year  the company recognized net credits resulting from two significant gains  which were partially offset by certain costs 
a tabular summary of the activity is as follows in thousands gain on japan pension restructuring gain on sale of shinagawa  japan property other shinagawa  japan asset disposals impairment of gotemba  japan property held for sale transition costs acquisition related credits costs  net the gain on pension restructuring resulted from the substantial settlement of the defined benefit pension plans in japan during the second quarter of the current fiscal year  which is further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the gain on sale of shinagawa  japan property resulted from sale of the previous japan headquarters building during the third quarter of the current fiscal year 
the company is currently actively marketing a second property located in gotemba  japan  and incurred the million impairment charge of this property in the third quarter of the current fiscal year to properly reflect its carrying amount at the estimated net selling price 
transition costs represent incremental costs incurred to integrate the operations of the acquired entity into the on going operations of the company 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company offered voluntary retention bonuses to certain employees in gotemba  japan as an incentive to remain with the company through august while the company completes its plan to transition manufacturing operations to other locations 
accordingly  the company will recognize a liability for retention bonuses for employees of approximately million ratably through august during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recognized an expense of million for the retention bonuses  which are included in acquisition related credits costs  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
non operating income expense interest income during fiscal year decreased million from the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income was due to a lower average balance of invested cash as well as lower yields on invested cash 
interest expense during fiscal year decreased million as compared with fiscal year the decrease in interest expense was largely due to a lower average balance of outstanding debt due to the company s retirement of million of outstanding debt in the first quarter of fiscal year on the scheduled payment date of august  in addition  the company paid the outstanding principal balance in full on the tibor debt facility during fiscal year for additional discussion of the company s borrowing activity please refer to the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section below

income taxes income tax expense for fiscal year was million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
during the prior fiscal year  the company realized an overall tax benefit of million due to a million benefit resulting from the settlement of the irs audit of the company s fiscal year  and this benefit in fiscal year was offset in part by income tax expense of million  which was recorded at an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from in the prior fiscal year to during the current fiscal year was due to the resolution of certain tax contingencies as well as the net utilization of previously impaired foreign tax credits 
the effective tax rate was impacted by a variety of estimates  including the amount of income during fiscal year and the mix of that income between foreign and domestic sources 
to the extent the estimates of these and other amounts change  the effective tax rate may change accordingly 
discontinued operations during fiscal year  management of the company approved and initiated an active plan for the sale of gage applied sciences gage  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
gage  located in montreal  canada  produced pc based instruments products 
the divestiture of this entity was consistent with the company s strategy of concentrating its resources in core product areas and de emphasizing products which are determined to be less aligned with strategic objectives

these increases were partially offset by additional operating expenses from the consolidation of the japan subsidiary 
earnings loss per share the increase in earnings per share is a result of the increased net earnings discussed above  and to a lesser extent  decreased weighted average shares outstanding in the current year as a result of shares repurchased by the company 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year economic conditions beginning in the second half of fiscal year  and continuing through fiscal year  economic conditions had a significant negative impact on many markets into which the company sold products including  but not limited to  optical design and manufacturing  mobile handset manufacturing  automated test equipment  telecommunications and semiconductor design and manufacturing

see forward looking statements that precedes item of this form k 
market risk and cyclical downturns in the markets in which tektronix competes tektronix business depends on capital expenditures of manufacturers in a wide range of industries  including the telecommunications  semiconductor  and computer industries 
each of these industries has historically been very cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns  which have had a material adverse impact on the industries demand for equipment  including test and measurement equipment manufactured and marketed by tektronix 
in particular  the telecommunications industry  including but not limited to the optical segment  has experienced more dramatic declines than other industries 
in addition  the severity and length of any downturn may also affect overall access to capital  which could adversely affect the company s customers across many industries 
during periods of reduced and declining demand  tektronix may need to rapidly align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions while at the same time motivating and retaining key employees 
while the economy had recovered by fiscal year  no assurance can be given regarding the length or extent of the recovery  and no assurance can be given that tektronix net sales and operating results will not be adversely impacted by the reversal of any current trends or any future downturns or slowdowns in the rate of capital investment in these industries 
timely delivery of competitive products tektronix sells its products to customers that participate in rapidly changing high technology markets  which are characterized by short product life cycles 
the company s ability to deliver a timely flow of competitive new products and market acceptance of those products  as well as the ability to increase production or to develop and maintain effective sales channels  is essential to growing the business 
because tektronix sells test and measurement products that enable its customers to develop new technologies  the company must accurately anticipate the ever evolving needs of those customers and deliver appropriate products and new technologies at competitive prices to meet customer demands 
the company s ability to deliver such products could be affected by engineering or other development program delays as well as the availability of parts and supplies from third party providers on a timely basis and at reasonable prices 
failure to deliver competitive products in a timely manner and at a reasonable price could have an adverse effect on the results of operations  financial condition or cash flows of the company 
competition tektronix competes with a number of companies in specialized areas of other test and measurement products and one large broad line measurement products supplier  agilent technologies 
other competitors include acterna corporation  anritsu corporation  lecroy corporation  rohde schwarz  spirent plc  yokogawa electric corporation and many other smaller companies 
in general  the test and measurement industry is a highly competitive market based primarily on product performance  technology  customer service  product availability and price 
some of the company s competitors may have greater resources to apply to each of these factors and in some cases have built significant reputations with the customer base in each market in which tektronix competes 
the company faces pricing pressures that may have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
if the company is unable to compete effectively on these and other factors  it could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in addition  the company enjoys a leadership position in certain core product categories  and continually develops and introduces new products designed to maintain that leadership  as well as to penetrate new markets 
failure to develop and introduce new products that maintain a leadership position or that fail to penetrate new markets  may adversely affect operating results 
supplier risks the company s manufacturing operations are dependent on the ability of suppliers to deliver quality components  subassemblies and completed products in time to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules 
the company periodically experiences constrained supply of certain component parts in some product lines as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts 
such constraints  if persistent  may adversely affect operating results until alternate sourcing can be developed 
there is increased risk of supplier constraints in periods where the company is increasing production volume to meet customer demands 
volatility in the prices of these component parts  an inability to secure enough components at reasonable prices to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities and configurations demanded or  conversely  a temporary oversupply of these parts  could adversely affect the company s future operating results 
in addition  the company uses certain sole sourced components  which are integral to a variety of products 
disruption in key sole sourced suppliers could have a significant adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
worldwide economic and market conditions the company maintains operations in four major geographies the americas  including the united states  and other americas  which includes mexico  canada and south america  europe  which includes europe  russia  the middle east and africa  the pacific  which includes china  india  korea and singapore  and japan 
during the last fiscal year  more than half of the company s revenues were from international sales 
in addition  some of the company s manufacturing operations and key suppliers are located in foreign countries  including china  where the company expects to further expand its operations 
as a result  the business is subject to the worldwide economic and market conditions risks generally associated with doing business globally  such as fluctuating exchange rates  the stability of international monetary conditions  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest  wars and acts of terrorism  epidemic disease or other health concerns and changes in other economic or political conditions 
these factors  among others  could influence the company s ability to sell in global markets  as well as its ability to manufacture products or procure supplies 
a significant downturn in the global economy or a particular region could adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
intellectual property risks as a technology based company  tektronix success depends on developing and protecting its intellectual property 
tektronix relies generally on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and abroad 
electronic equipment as complex as most of the company s products  however  is generally not patentable in its entirety 
tektronix also licenses intellectual property from third parties and relies on those parties to maintain and protect their technology 
the company cannot be certain that actions the company takes to establish and protect proprietary rights will be adequate  particularly in countries including china where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected 
if the company is unable to adequately protect its technology  or if the company is unable to continue to obtain or maintain licenses for protected technology from third parties  it could have a material adverse affect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
from time to time in the usual course of business  the company receives notices from third parties regarding intellectual property infringement or takes action against others with regard to intellectual property rights 
even where the company is successful in defending or pursuing such claims  the company may incur significant costs 
in the event of a successful claim against the company  tektronix could lose its rights to needed technology or be required to pay license fees for the infringed rights  either of which could have an adverse impact on the company s business 
environmental risks tektronix is subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of its hazardous chemicals used during the company s manufacturing process 
the company has closed a licensed hazardous waste management facility at its beaverton  oregon campus and has entered into a consent order with the oregon department of environmental quality requiring certain remediation actions see part i  item  environment above 
if tektronix fails to comply with the consent order or any present or future regulations  the company could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict the company s ability to expand its facilities or could require tektronix to acquire costly equipment  or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
possible volatility of stock price the price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide  rapid fluctuations 
such fluctuations may be due to factors specific to the company  such as changes in operating results or changes in analysts estimates regarding earnings 
fluctuations in the stock price may also be due to factors relating to the telecommunications  semiconductor  and computer industries or to the securities markets in general 
fluctuations in stock prices have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies whose stocks are traded 
shareholders should be willing to incur the risk of such fluctuations 
successful integration of inet  technologies  inc the proposed transaction to acquire inet is subject to a number of contingencies  including approval by inet s shareholders and regulatory approvals 
failure to satisfy those contingencies will prevent closing the transaction and will prevent the planned merger of the two companies 
the successful integration of the inet business is subject to a number of risk factors which could materially adversely affect tektronix consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
these risks include the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds integrating inet s technology and products combining different corporate cultures retaining key employees maintaining customer satisfaction and current bid processes maintaining product development schedules coordinating sales and marketing activities preserving important distribution relationships diversion of management s attention with consequent negative impact upon the company s execution of its overall strategy failure to realize upon expected cost savings and other synergies from the merger discontinuation of rohde and schwarz distribution agreement effective june   tektronix no longer distributes rohde schwarz products 
discontinuation of this distribution agreement will result in the loss of the associated revenue and gross profit 
while the company has implemented specific actions to offset the associated decrease in gross profit by reducing and redirecting certain costs  there is a risk that these targeted actions will not be sufficient  it may take longer to complete these actions than originally anticipated  or involve additional risks that were not foreseen by the company 
other risk factors other risk factors include but are not limited to changes in the mix of products sold  regulatory and tax legislation  changes in effective tax rates  inventory risks due to changes in market demand or the company s business strategies  potential litigation and claims arising in the normal course of business  credit risk of customers  the fact that a substantial portion of the company s sales are generated from orders received during each quarter  significant modifications to existing information systems  and the susceptibility of assets in the company s pension plans to market risk and other risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including interest rate  equity price and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
the company maintains a short term and long term investment portfolio consisting of fixed rate commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  us treasury and agency notes  asset backed securities and mortgage securities 
the weighted average maturity of the portfolio  excluding mortgage securities  was two years or less 
mortgage securities may have a weighted average life of less than seven years and are managed consistent with the lehman mortgage index 
an increase in interest rates of similar instruments would decrease the value of certain of these investments 
a rise in interest rates as of may  would reduce the market value by million  which would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until sold 
at may   the company had no bond indebtedness 
the bonds were retired on august  the company is exposed to equity price risk primarily through its marketable equity securities portfolio  including investments in merix corporation  tut systems  inc  and other companies 
the company has not entered into any hedging programs to mitigate equity price risk 
an adverse change of in the value of these securities would reduce the market value by million  which would likely be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets until sold 
if the adverse change results in an impairment that is considered to be other than temporary  the loss on impairment would be charged to net earnings on the consolidated statements of operations 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
the company utilizes derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts  generally with maturities of one to three months  to mitigate this risk where natural hedging strategies cannot be employed 
the company s policy is to only enter into derivative transactions when the company has an identifiable exposure to risk  thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
at may   there were no forward foreign currency exchange contracts
