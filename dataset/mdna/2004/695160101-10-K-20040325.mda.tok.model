item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion including the summary and outlook should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes thereto  and the other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see special note regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
in the discussion that follows  dollar amounts other than per share data are stated in thousands 
in  the company began reporting its financial results in two segments 
the converting operations segment included all the converting operations of the company 
the specialty paper segment included the detroit paper mill operation 
with the shutdown of the detroit paper mill  the specialty paper segment is now reported as a discontinued operation and the converting operations segment now represents the company s continuing operations 
summary and outlook was packaging dynamics first full year as a public company 
during  we successfully integrated the acquisition of wolf  made a strategic decision to exit the specialty paper operation and shut down the detroit paper mill in the fourth quarter  successfully refinanced the senior credit facility  declared the first quarterly cash dividend in the history of the company  and completed the acquisition of the net assets of the iuka lamination division of ormet corporation in the fourth quarter 
we start a much different company than we did in the shutdown of the detroit paper mill will allow management to sharpen its focus on expanding sales and profits in our core converting products 
the company will continue to grow the top line from both internal growth and targeted acquisitions 
operating margins continued to improve in in  we will see upward pressure on raw material costs in both aluminum foil and paper as the underlying cost of ingot and pulp trend up  but as a result of the investments in productivity improvements and the opportunities around sourcing paper  we believe that we will be able to continue the same rate of operating margin improvement in financial performance net sales net sales grew to  in reflected in the results for is the impact of shifts from foil to paper products by several customers in our foodservice markets and the strategic exit of certain products and customers in our distribution and retail markets  which were offset by increased sales volume related to the wolf acquisition 
the flexibility to shift products between various substrates  such as paper  foil  and film  is a strength for the company 
the company maintained or improved its position on most major contracts in the company believes it is well positioned to respond to our customers as they introduce new menu items in response to the increasing focus on nutrition of their customers 
net sales increased during the year ended december  over net sales during the corresponding period in the increase resulted primarily from additional volume associated with promotional business of higher sales price foil based sandwich wrap products with major quick service restaurants and the acquisition of wolf during the fourth quarter of overall  net sales of food packaging products increased  during compared to the prior year 
gross profit gross profit increased from  to  in compared to the corresponding period in the prior year with gross profit margin at which was higher than the improved margin reflects the ongoing impact of our productivity investments in converting equipment  lower manufacturing overhead as we continue to reduce overall staffing levels  and improving product mix as we exit unprofitable products and customers 
raw material and energy costs had no material impact on gross profit compared to gross profit increased during compared to primarily as a result of increased sales volume 
gross profit margin remained constant at during the gross profit margin was favorably impacted by the product mix as well as lower raw material and energy costs offset by increased competitive pricing in the marketplace  primarily for specialty paper 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in as a percentage of net sales  selling and administrative expenses decreased to during compared to in excluding the effect of long term incentive compensation expenses in discussed below  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in compared to this was primarily due to the acquisition of wolf  costs of realigning the finance and information technology groups and the incremental expense associated with a full year operating as a public company in selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  during compared to as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to during compared to during the increase resulted primarily from long term incentive compensation expense discussed below  higher selling expenses associated with the sales and marketing efforts and increased insurance costs 
on july   packaging dynamics granted to management  for incentive purposes and in consideration of their waiver of cash payments under the long tem incentive compensation plan the ltip  stock options for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares of its common stock under the long term incentive stock plan 
additionally  on july   packaging dynamics granted to certain former employees stock options for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares of its common stock under individual nonqualified stock option agreements in consideration of their waiver of cash payments under the ltip 
the options have an exercise price of per share  which was below the fair market value of packaging dynamics common stock on the grant date and  options  although fully vested  are not exercisable for three years after the grant date 
consequently  for such options we have the right to repurchase an executive s options if he terminates employment before the end of the three year period 
we recorded a non cash compensation charge of  for the twelve months ended december  related to these management incentive plans 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we recorded no expense related to this plan 
during   of these options were canceled and  were exercised 
as of december    of these options remain outstanding 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization of intangibles increased  or  during compared to the increase was due to amortization of non compete agreements related to the wolf acquisition 
depreciation and amortization decreased  or  during compared to the decrease primarily results from the elimination of goodwill amortization during  partially offset by the amortization of certain intangibles associated with the wolf acquisition 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to no longer be amortized but to instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
other intangible assets with determinable lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the application of this statement resulted in the reduction of goodwill amortization of for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in asset sales and disposals we continue our efforts to upgrade the capabilities of our manufacturing operations 
during and  we idled certain converting equipment in our chicago  illinois and baxter springs  kansas manufacturing facilities due to the purchase of five new bag machines in the new bag machines have improved productivity on several product categories 
these manufacturing improvements and certain other productivity improvements resulted in a loss in and of and  respectively  on the sale or disposal of the equipment 
ameriserve bad debt provision ameriserve began to experience cash flow problems during late and filed for bankruptcy in january we recorded a bad debt provision during of  for all of the ameriserve receivables that became uncollectible in connection with the bankruptcy 
during  we settled certain preferential payment claims for income from operations income from operations and operating margin were  and  respectively  during compared to income from operations and operating margin of  and  respectively  during excluding the assets sale and disposal charges in both and  and the long term incentive compensation charge in income from operations for was  and operating margin was and for was  and  respectively 
the improvement in operating income and margins from to reflects the ongoing impact of investments in converting assets  reduced manufacturing overhead  improving raw material costs and sales mix 
income from operations and operating margin were  and  respectively  during  compared to  and  respectively  during the decrease in operating income from to resulted primarily from the increased operating expenses including the asset sales and disposals and long term incentive compensation charge  partially offset by the elimination of amortization of goodwill 
excluding the asset sales and disposals and long term incentive compensation charge during and the ameriserve bad debt provision and amortization of goodwill during  income from operations and operating margins were  and  respectively  during and  and  respectively  during an increase in gross profit of  in compared to was more than offset by the  compensation expense and the  loss on sale and disposal of assets recorded in interest expense interest expense during was  compared to  during the same period in the decrease in interest expense in compared to resulted primarily from decreased average outstanding indebtedness as a result of reductions in working capital and the forgiveness of the promissory note payable to ivex 
the average interest rates on borrowings were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense during was  compared to  during the decrease in interest expense in compared to resulted primarily from decreased interest rates and average outstanding indebtedness as a result of reductions in working capital and the forgiveness of the promissory note payable to ivex 
the average interest rates on borrowings were approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the paid in kind interest expense on the promissory note was in compared with  in  reflecting the cancellation of the promissory note payable to ivex as of july  income taxes the company recorded income tax expense of  in compared to  in the company s effective tax rate on income from continuing operations is and for and  respectively 
to facilitate the distribution on july   a new holding company structure was created by contributing all of the limited liability company interests of packaging holdings to packaging dynamics  a c corporation for income tax purposes  in exchange for the common stock 
prior to the distribution  the members of packaging holdings reported federal and state taxable income on their income tax returns as if it were a partnership 
ici has remained a taxable c corporation from the time we acquired it in july through the date of the distribution 
the income tax provision for was  compared to in the increase in income tax provision was primarily associated with our change in filing status 
income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations was   and  for  and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to compensation expense of  recorded in as well as productivity improvements in in addition  loss on asset sales and disposals decreased in compared to an increase in gross profit of  in compared to was more than offset by the  compensation expense and the  loss on sale and disposal of assets recorded in discontinued operations in the third quarter of the company made the strategic decision to exit the specialty paper segment and shut down the detroit paper mill which  prior to its closure  produced approximately  tons of paper annually and employed approximately people 
the mill s paper machines were relatively narrow  slow and limited in capability which made it difficult to compete in a market with overcapacity 
the results of operations for the specialty paper segment  including the charges discussed below  are classified as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
in connection with the exit from specialty paper  the company recorded a   after tax asset impairment charge and a   after tax severance charge in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an additional charge of   after tax primarily related to the write down of parts and supplies inventories  the write down of other current assets and for employee outplacement services  and a charge of after tax for pension liability 
the exit from the specialty paper segment resulted in a  reduction in working capital defined as trade receivables plus inventories less trade payables and a  tax benefit related to operating losses  including the charges discussed above 
in we will have additional costs related to our ongoing program to clear the site  recover assets and dispose of the detroit property 
although the total amount of such costs are not currently estimable  we believe that the cash impact of the exit from specialty paper in will be neutral for packaging dynamics 
in addition  our new paper supplier relationships are working well and should contribute to further margin improvement through waste reduction  grade consolidation and raw material cost stability in our continuing operations 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda in addition to financial results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  packaging dynamics utilizes non gaap financial measures within the meaning of regulation g promulgated by the securities and exchange commission 
for purposes of regulation g  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income  balance sheet or statement of cash flows or equivalent statements of the company  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 
these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap  but are not a substitute for or superior to gaap results 
non gaap financial measures are used because management believes this information provides investors useful information in evaluating the results of the continuing operations and believes that this information provides the users of the financial statements a valuable insight into the operating results given the restructuring of packaging dynamics and distribution by ivex of its ownership interest in packaging dynamics in the non gaap measure of adjusted ebitda is presented to supplement the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the company defines ebitda as earnings from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
specifically  management believes that adjusted ebitda is of interest to its investors and lenders in relation to its debt covenants  as certain of its debt covenants include this adjusted ebitda as a performance measure 
refer to liquidity and capital resources for additional disclosure of these debt covenants 
adjusted ebitda is summarized in the table below 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to earnings from operations as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  as an indicator of our operating performance  as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we have significant uses of cash flow  including capital expenditures and debt principal repayments that are not reflected in adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda for the years ended december   and is computed as follows income from continuing operations    income tax provision   interest expense    depreciation and amortization    ebitda    non recurring and unusual items long term incentive compensation expense  asset sales and disposals  ameriserve bad debt provision adjusted ebitda    disclosure about critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent liabilities 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the company s annual consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical  as these policies are the most important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and require significant  difficult or complex judgments by management  often employing the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimation methodologies are applied consistently from year to year 
the following is a summary of accounting policies management considers critical to the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time title transfers to the customer generally upon shipment of products 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of goods sold 
credit memos are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
inventories the company states inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out  or fifo  method to determine the cost of raw materials and finished goods 
this cost includes raw materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment 
our policy is to evaluate all inventory quantities for amounts on hand that are potentially in excess of estimated usage requirements  and to write down any excess quantities to estimated net realizable value 
inherent in estimates of net realizable value are manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
accounts receivable accounts receivable from sales to customers are unsecured  and we value accounts receivable net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances are based on estimates of the portion of the receivables that will not be collected in the future 
however  the ultimate collectibility of a receivable is significantly dependent upon the financial condition of the individual customer  which can change rapidly and without advance warning 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts as an estimate of the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts by looking at a variety of factors 
first we examine an aging of the accounts receivable 
the aging lists past due amounts according to invoice terms 
in addition  we consider the current economic environment  the credit rating of the customers and general overall market conditions 
if we determine that a customer is unlikely to pay  we record a charge to bad debt expense in the income statement and an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
please refer to page in this form k schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three years 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover any future non payments of our customers 
however  if economic conditions deteriorate significantly or one of our large customers was to declare bankruptcy  a larger allowance for doubtful accounts might be necessary 
it is extremely difficult to estimate how much of an additional reserve would be necessary  but the largest potential customer balance at any one time would not exceed million 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in accordance with sfas in addition  the remaining amortization period for the impaired asset would be reassessed and revised if necessary 
impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas  we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
sfas requires that if the carrying value of a reporting unit for which goodwill exists exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  we have evaluated our goodwill for impairment and have determined that the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their carrying value  so we did not recognize an impairment of goodwill 
goodwill of approximately  is shown on our balance sheet as of december  we believe that the accounting estimate related to determining the fair value of our reporting units is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires company management to make assumptions about the future cash flows for each reporting unit over several years in the future  and the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet as well as our results of operations could be material 
management s assumptions about future cash flows for the reporting units require significant judgment and actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those forecasted today 
in estimating future cash flows  we use internally generated budgets reviewed by management 
we develop our budgets based upon recent sales trends  discussions with our customers  planned timing of new product launches  forecasted capital expenditure needs  working capital needs  costing factors and many other variables 
from these internally generated budgets  a projection of cash flows is made based upon expected sales growth rates and capital and working capital requirements based upon historical needs 
we believe our assumptions used in discounting future cash flows are appropriately conservative 
any increase in estimated cash flows would have no impact on the reported carrying amount of goodwill 
however  if our current estimates of cash flow had been lower  the fair value of the reporting unit would have been lower than the carrying value thus requiring us to perform an impairment test to determine the implied value of goodwill 
stock based compensation we follow apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb no 
and the related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
issued subsequent to apb no 
 defines a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options but allows companies to continue to measure compensation cost for employee stock options using the intrinsic value based method prescribed in apb no 
we believe that applying the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options prescribed by apb no 
is a critical accounting policy because application of sfas no 
would require us to estimate the fair value of employee stock options at the date of the grant and record an expense in the income statement over the vesting period for the fair value calculated  thus reducing net income and earnings per share 
we have no immediate plans at this time to voluntarily change our accounting policy to the fair value based method  however  we continue to evaluate this alternative 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have been disclosing in the notes to the consolidated financial statements the impact on our net income and earnings per share had we adopted the fair value based method 
if we had adopted the fair value based method in  our net loss would have been higher than reported or approximately 
diluted loss per share higher than reported 
if we had applied the fair value based method and recorded the additional after tax expense of  it would not have affected our liquidity and capital resources because  in spite of the additional expense  we would have been within the terms of our debt covenants 
income taxes in the normal course of business  the company is regularly audited by federal and state authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and intends to defend its positions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions  and management believes these reserves are adequate 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be impacted if the company prevailed in matters for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
no valuation allowance is considered necessary as of december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and  was available under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility  after taking into account  in letter of credits outstanding 
our working capital at december  was  our primary short term and long term operating cash requirements are for debt service  working capital and capital expenditures 
we expect to rely on cash generated from operations supplemented by revolving borrowings under the senior credit facility to fund principal short term and long term cash requirements 
during the third quarter of  the company refinanced its senior credit facility 
the new credit facility provides for a term a loan and term b loan totaling  and a  revolving credit facility  up to  of which may be in the form of letters of credit 
as of december   the term a loan had a balance of  and will mature in the required aggregate annual payments  payable in equal quarterly installments total     and  in years through  respectively 
as of december   the term b loan had a balance of  and will mature in the aggregate annual payments  payable in equal quarterly installments  total  in years through and  in the revolver had a balance of  as of december  loans under the senior credit facility are designated from time to time  at our election  either as eurodollar rate loans  which bear interest at a rate based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor  adjusted for regulatory reserve requirements  or as base rate loans  which bear interest at a rate based on the federal funds rate or the prime rate 
the interest rate on eurodollar rate loans is equal to libor plus an applicable percentage that varies with the leverage ratio of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the interest rate on base rate loans is equal to a base rate equal to the greater of the federal funds rate plus of or the prime rate  plus an applicable percentage that varies with the leverage ratio of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries 
accordingly  tranche a term loans and revolving loans bear interest at rates of up to plus the base rate  in the case of base rate loans  and up to plus libor  in the case of eurodollar loans 
tranche b term loans bear interest at rates of plus the base rate  in the case of base rate loans  and plus libor  in the case of eurodollar loans 
at december   the interest rates on borrowings under the tranche a term loan and the tranche b term loan were plus libor and plus libor  respectively  compared with plus libor and plus libor  respectively  at december  as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a group of banks having notional amounts totaling  and with various maturity dates 
these agreements effectively fix our libor rate for  and  of our senior credit facility indebtedness at rates of and  respectively 
borrowings are collateralized by substantially all of the stock and assets of our operating subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility and term a loan will terminate on september  and the term b loan will terminate on september  under the senior credit facility  we are required to comply on a quarterly basis with the following four financial covenants under the leverage ratio covenant  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  the ratio of total funded debt of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries to consolidated ebitda of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the month period then ended must not exceed specified levels  decreasing various levels from to at december  to to  under the senior leverage ratio covenant  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  the ratio of total funded debt other than subordinated debt of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries to consolidated ebitda of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the month period then ended must not exceed specified levels  decreasing various levels from to at december  to to  under the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  for the month period then ended  the ratio of consolidated ebitda less capital expenditures and cash tax payments of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries to cash interest expense and scheduled funded debt payments of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries must be equal to or greater than certain levels increasing from to at december  to to  and under the net worth covenant  packaging dynamics consolidated net worth as of the last day of each fiscal quarter must be equal to or greater than of the net worth as of september  increased on a cumulative basis by as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  of the consolidated net income of packaging dynamics to the extent positive for the fiscal quarter then ended  commencing with the fiscal quarter ended december  and of the net cash proceeds from any equity issuance by packaging dynamics or any subsidiary of packaging dynamics 
for purposes of the senior credit facility  consolidated ebitda  calculated on a consolidated basis for packaging dynamics and its subsidiaries  consists of net income from continuing operations  excluding the effect of any extraordinary or other non recurring gains or losses or non cash gains or losses in each case  other than in connection with the closure of the detroit paper mill  plus an amount which  in the determination of net income  has been deducted for interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and cash and non cash charges and or losses with respect to the closure of the detroit paper mill  minus cash expenditures related to non cash charges previously added back to net income in determining ebitda other than in connection with the closure of the detroit paper mill  plus the write off of capitalized financing costs existing as of the closing of the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility also contains various negative covenants that  among other things  require packaging dynamics and its subsidiaries to limit future borrowings and payments to related parties  and restricts packaging dynamics ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to merge or consolidate 
in addition  the senior credit facility prohibits changes in the nature of business conducted by the company and its subsidiaries 
the failure to comply with the covenants would result in a default under the senior credit facility and permit the lenders under the senior credit facility to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness governed by the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility includes terms that limit changes in our ownership structure 
modifications to the ownership structure outside the limits prescribed by such agreements could place us in default under these debt instruments 
the senior credit facility requires pdoc to maintain specified financial ratios and levels of tangible net worth 
pdoc was in compliance with those covenants as of december   the latest measurement date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use interest rate swaps and collars to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs 
we have designated these instruments as cash flow hedges and consider these instruments effective at offsetting our risk to variable interest rates on debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk consists of floating rate debt instruments that are benchmarked to libor 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a group of banks having notional amounts totaling  with various maturity dates through december  beginning on december   we have a no cost collar agreement with a notional amount of  maturing on december  this collar agreement effectively fixes the libor base rate for  of our senior credit facility indebtedness at a maximum of and allow for us to pay the market libor from a floor of to the maximum rate 
effective december   the company has an interest rate swap agreement effectively fixing our libor rate for  of our senior credit facility indebtedness at a rate of 
if libor falls below  we are required to pay the floor rate of
