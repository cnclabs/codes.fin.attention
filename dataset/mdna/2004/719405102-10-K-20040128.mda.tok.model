item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended november   november  and october  overview in  the company completed the acquisition of a majority equity interest in pkl ltd  or pkl  a leading korean photomask supplier  for million 
in april  the company acquired an additional of pkl in exchange for  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly goodwill in the aggregate of million was recorded 
the operating results of pkl have been included in the company s consolidated statements of operations since august  the company sells substantially all of its photomasks to semiconductor designers and manufacturers 
the company believes that the demand for photomasks primarily depends on integrated circuit design activity rather than the volume of semiconductor sales 
consequently  an increase in semiconductor sales does not necessarily result in a corresponding increase in photomask sales 
in addition  the reduced use of customized integrated circuits  a reduction in design complexity or other changes in the technology or methods of manufacturing semiconductors or a slowdown in the introduction of new semiconductor designs could reduce demand for photomasks even if demand for semiconductors increases 
further  advances in semiconductor and photomask design and semiconductor production methods could reduce the demand for photomasks 
historically  the semiconductor industry has been volatile  with sharp periodic downturns and slowdowns 
these downturns have been characterized by  among other things  diminished product demand  excess production capacity and accelerated erosion of selling prices 
the semiconductor industry has been in a downturn since which has had a significant impact on its net sales and operating results 
the company cannot predict as to when the current downturn will end or that it will not continue to worsen or materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and operating results in the near term 
the photomask industry has been and is expected to continue to be characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
in order to remain competitive  the company will be required to continually anticipate  respond to and utilize changing technologies 
in particular  the company believes that  as semiconductor geometries continue to become smaller  it will be required to manufacture complex optically enhanced reticles  including optical proximity correction and phase shift photomasks 
additionally  demand for photomasks has been  and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in methods of semiconductor manufacturing which could affect the type or quantity of photomasks utilized  such as changes in semiconductor demand that favor field programmable gate arrays and other semiconductor designs that replace application specific integrated circuits 
to date  the company has not experienced a significant loss of revenue as a result of alternative semiconductor design methodologies 
additionally  increased market acceptance of alternative methods of transferring circuit designs onto semiconductor wafers  such as direct write lithography  could reduce or eliminate the need for photomasks 
presently  direct write lithography has not been proven to be a commercially viable alternative to photomasks  as it is considered too slow for high volume semiconductor wafer production 
however  should direct write or any other alternative methods of transferring integrated circuit designs to semiconductor wafers be done without the use of photomasks  the company s business and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if the company is unable to anticipate  respond to or utilize these or other changing technologies  due to resource  technological or other constraints  its business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
both revenues and costs have been affected by the increased demand for high end technology photomasks that require more advanced manufacturing capabilities but generally command higher average selling prices 
to meet the technological demands of its customers and position the company for future growth  the company continues to make substantial investments in high end manufacturing capability both at existing and new facilities 
the company s capital expenditures for new facilities and equipment to support its customers requirements for high technology products was approximately million for the three fiscal years ended november   resulting in significant increases in operating expenses 
based on the anticipated technological changes in the industry  the company expects these trends to continue 
the manufacture of photomasks for use in fabricating integrated circuits and other related products built using comparable photomask based process technologies has been and continues to be capital intensive based upon the need to maintain a technology based infrastructure 
the company s integrated global manufacturing network and employees  which consists of nine sites  represent a significant portion of its fixed operating cost base 
should sales volumes decrease based upon the flow of design releases from the company s customers  the company may have excess and underutilized production capacity that could significantly impact operating margins 
the vast majority of photomasks produced for the semiconductor industry employ geometries of nanometers or larger 
at these geometries  the company can produce full lines of photomasks and there is no significant technology employed by the company s competitors that is not available to the company 
very recently  a limited amount of semiconductor fabrication has begun in the nanometer range 
the company is currently capable of producing a broad range of photomasks at these smaller geometries 
however  as is typical of industries in the midst of technological change  some of the company s competitors may be able to achieve higher manufacturing yields than the company when producing these smaller geometry photomasks  in part because these competitors may have completed more cycles of learning than the company in this area and in part because of the company s need to replicate production of these complex photomasks at its four advanced technology locations world wide 
the company believes that these cases are not material to its business 
results of operations the following table represents selected operating information expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended november  november  october  net sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses consolidation  restructuring and related charges operating income loss interest expense investment and other income  net loss before income tax provision benefit and minority interest income tax provision benefit minority interest net loss net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended november  decreased million or to million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was attributable to a slow down in new design releases  due in part  to decreased end user demand  both consumer and corporate  for devices utilizing semiconductors and continued increased competitive pricing pressures for mature technology products 
during  the company experienced an overall decline in average selling prices and unit volumes as a result of the competitive pricing pressures for mature technology products and a decrease in new design releases 
additionally  in  the company continued to experience a reduction in sales in north america  due in part to the continued migration of semiconductor manufacturing to asian foundries by certain north america customers 
by geographic area  net sales in asia increased million or  while north america sales decreased million or and european sales decreased million or 
net sales for the fiscal year ended november  increased to million  compared to million in primarily as a result of increased growth in asia as a result of inclusion of the company s majority held subsidiary in korea for the increase  however  was partially mitigated by decreased sales in north america  as certain north american customers moved their semiconductor manufacturing to foundries located in asia 
other factors contributing to the increased sales in included an improved sales mix of high end technology products and increased unit volume associated with increased design releases 
the increased design releases were primarily experienced during the first six months of the year 
sales decreased during the second half of due to a slow down in new design releases for mature and high end technology products  due in part  to the decreased end user demand  both consumer and corporate  for devices utilizing semiconductors and continued increased competitive pricing pressures for mature products 
gross margin the decline in the company s gross margins in  and was primarily associated with the decreased utilization of the company s expanded fixed equipment base  primarily in north america  due to decreased demand and competitive pricing pressures 
during the later half of  continuing through  the company was impacted by the severe and prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry  which resulted in decreased demand and increased competitive pricing pressures 
the company also began to experience increased growth in asia during this time  while north america sales began to decline 
to mitigate the decline in its business  which has impacted its gross margins  in april the company commenced a consolidation plan  which reduced its manufacturing locations from seven to five in the united states  and from four to three in europe 
in august  the company continued to reduce its operating cost structure by closing its milpitas  california facility 
in march  the company began to further restructure its operations in the united states by closing its phoenix  arizona facility and reducing its global work force 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended november  decreased to from for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease was primarily associated with decreased sales volume  which decreased the utilization of the company s fixed equipment cost base  due in part to lower than anticipated demand for high end technology products which have design rules of micron and below  and competitive pricing pressures for mature product technologies resulting in lower average selling prices 
gross margin for the fiscal year ended november  decreased to from for the fiscal year ended october  the decrease was primarily associated with the decreased utilization of the company s expanded fixed equipment cost base  primarily in north america  due in part to decreased demand and competitive pricing pressures for mature product technologies 
the decreased demand for all technologies was primarily experienced during the latter half of as fewer designs were released into production 
additionally  improved gross margins at the company s subsidiary in korea were offset by lower margins from the company s other locations 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended november  decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales for the fiscal year ended november  the decrease was primarily attributable to reduced salary and wages and facility costs associated with the company s north american consolidation initiatives 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended november  increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales for the fiscal year ended october  the increase in was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the company s korean subsidiary for all of and increased information technology costs associated with the company s global infrastructure 
these increases were partially mitigated by reduced amortization costs of million in as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets see note to the consolidated financial statements 
research and development research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended november   decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales in fiscal research and development expenses consists primarily of the global development efforts of high end process technologies for advanced  sub wavelength reticle solutions in next generation lithography ngl applications which include the company s five installed nano technology line tool sets 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended november   increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales in fiscal the increase in fiscal year is attributable to the continuing global development efforts of high end process technologies for advanced  sub wavelength reticle solutions in ngl applications 
consolidation  restructuring and related charges since  the company has closed four manufacturing facilities in north america and one in europe due in part to the migration of semiconductor manufacturing to asia and excess capacity associated with decreased demand 
the decision to close facilities in north america corresponded to the decreased north american sales volume 
the company s north american net sales declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  and to million in fiscal the decline in north america sales from to resulted in increased north america operating losses during and the decline in sales volume and operating profits in north america was attributable to the company s customers migrating their business to lower cost foundries  primarily located in asia 
this created excess capacity in the united states 
competitive pricing pressures and weakened demand further eroded the company s united states operating results 
in march of  the company initiated a plan to close its phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility and further consolidate its north american manufacturing network in order to increase capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies 
total consolidation and related charges of million were recorded during the second quarter of fiscal components of the charge include million for workforce reduction of approximately employees in the united states  million for facility lease payments  and million of non cash charges for the impairment in carrying value of fixed assets 
the majority of the photomasks produced at the company s arizona facility were cross qualified with other united states manufacturing sites 
consequently  the decision to close the phoenix  arizona facility had minimal impact on united states production or customer service 
in august  the company implemented a plan to reduce its operating cost structure by reducing its work force in the united states by approximately employees and by ceasing the manufacture of photomasks at its milpitas  california facility 
total consolidation and related charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal of the total charge  million was non cash for the impairment in carrying value of fixed assets  million of cash charges for severance and benefits for terminated employees that will be paid during their entitlement periods and million of cash charges for facilities closing costs as well as lease termination costs 
in april  the company initiated a plan to consolidate its global photomask manufacturing network in order to increase capacity utilization and manufacturing efficiencies  as well as accelerate the expansion of its world class technology development 
total consolidation and related charges associated with this plan of million were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal of the total charge  million related to this plan and million related to the impairment of intangible assets that no longer had any future economic benefit to the company 
a significant component of this associated plan included the closing of the former align rite manufacturing facilities in burbank  california  palm bay  florida and heilbronn  germany which resulted in a reduction in work force of approximately employees 
the consolidation charge of million includes million of cash charges for severance benefits for terminated employees paid during their entitlement periods  million for facilities closings and lease termination costs expended over the projected lease terms  and non cash charges of million that approximated the carrying value of fixed assets that were primarily associated with this plan based upon their expected disposition 
the following tables set forth the company s restructuring reserves as of november   november  and october  and reflect the activities affecting the reserves for years then ended year ended november  november  november  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total year ended november  october  november  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total year ended october  october  october  balance charges credits balance manufacturing capacity reduction and other workforce reductions total as of november   the company anticipates that substantially all of the million relating to workforce reductions will be paid by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year  and non cancelable lease obligations and other of million will be paid over the respective lease terms through other income expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended november  decreased by million to million as compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily the result of reduced overall effective borrowing rates  partially offset by increased borrowings 
investment and other income  net  during fiscal decreased by million to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a million gain on the repurchase of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes in interest expense for the year ended november  increased by million to million as compared to million for  primarily the result of a million  convertible subordinated notes offering completed in december and additional borrowings associated with the company s investments in asia 
investment and other income  net  during fiscal increased by million to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a million gain on the repurchase of million of the company s convertible subordinated notes 
income taxes the company s operations have followed the recent migration of semiconductor industry fabrication to asia  where the company operates in countries where it is accorded favorable tax jurisdictions 
the company is accorded tax holidays in taiwan and singapore  which expire in and  respectively 
in korea  various investment tax credits have been utilized to reduce the company s effective income tax rate 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended november  was million or of pretax loss 
the effective rate of a provision differs from the federal statutory rate of a benefit as a result of the company s inability to record additional deferred tax benefits for net operating losses in the united states 
other factors contributing to the effective tax rate in include income from geographic regions for which the company has tax holidays and available tax credits  including taiwan and korea 
for the fiscal year ended november  the company recognized an income tax benefit of million or of the pretax loss 
the loss was a result of the company s consolidation plan charge  which primarily impacted united states tax rates  and a significant increase in the company s operations during in tax jurisdictions where the company has tax holidays and available tax credits 
the availability of tax holidays in some asian jurisdictions did not play a significant role in the company s decision to close some of its north american facilities nor in the company s increased asian presence which is in response to fundamental changes taking place in the semiconductor industry that the company serves 
as semiconductor fabrication has migrated to asia  in large part from the united states  the company has followed  in order to avoid a severe loss of business 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest charges were million for the fiscal year ended november  and million for the fiscal year ended november   and reflected the minority interest in earnings of the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries located in taiwan and korea 
the decrease in minority interest charge compared to the prior year was due to the company s ownership interest in pkl increasing by in april the minority interest charge of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal reflected the portion of income attributable to the minority shareholders of the company s non wholly owned subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources on april   the company sold million of its convertible subordinated notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of these notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
net proceeds from the issuance amounted to approximately million 
on june   a portion of the net proceeds was used to redeem all million of the company s outstanding convertible subordinated notes due pursuant to the terms of the related indenture  the convertible subordinated notes were redeemed at of the principal amount plus accrued interest of million for an aggregate redemption price of million  including a premium of million 
an early extinguishment charge of million was incurred on the redemption of the convertible subordinated notes 
this charge included the aforementioned million premium and million of unamortized deferred financing costs which were expensed at the time of redemption 
on december   the company sold million of convertible subordinated notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of these notes are convertible into the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
total net proceeds from the issuance amounted to approximately million 
concurrently with the issuance of these notes  on december  the company repaid all of its outstanding borrowings under its previous revolving credit agreement which amounted to million and terminated the agreement 
the company regularly reviews the availability and terms on which it might issue additional equity or debt securities in the public or private markets 
the company has a credit agreement  that expires in july  with a group of financial institutions that provides for a revolving credit facility with an aggregate commitment of million 
the credit facility allows for borrowings in various currencies with an interest rate that is based on the terms of the agreement and will vary based on currencies borrowed and market conditions 
during most of  the company had borrowed million in korean won denominated borrowings which had an effective interest rate of approximately 
the company repaid all of its outstanding borrowings million in korean won under the million credit facility in october the facility fee is of the total aggregate commitment 
the credit facility agreement contains various financial and other covenants  including  but not limited to defined maximum ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda  minimum ebitda to interest expense  minimum consolidated net worth and cash balances  limitation on cash dividends available for payment to shareholders and annual capital expenditures 
as of november   approximately million was available under the facility 
on april   the credit facility was amended to relax certain financial covenants as a result of the company s march consolidation plan and the company s issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the company s working capital at november  was million compared with million at november  the increase in working capital was primarily associated with the net proceeds of the company s million of convertible subordinated notes issued in april partially offset by the redemption of all million of the company s convertible subordinated notes 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at november  were million compared to million at november  cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended november  decreased to million from million for the fiscal year ended november   due in part to the increased net loss in fiscal and payments for certain capital equipment which was accrued for at november  cash used by investing activities of million consisted principally of capital equipment purchases of million 
the company expects capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million 
capital expenditures for fiscal will be used primarily to continue to expand the company s high end technical capability 
cash provided by financing activities of million consisted principally of the proceeds from the issuance of the company s convertible subordinated notes of million offset by the redemption of the company s convertible subordinated notes and other net debt repayments of million 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company repurchased all million of its convertible subordinated notes for total consideration of million  which included a premium of million 
the company believes that its currently available resources  together with its capacity for growth and its accessibility to debt and equity financing sources  are sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
the company s commitments represent investments in additional manufacturing capacity as well as advanced equipment for the production of high end  more complex photomasks 
at november   the company had commitments outstanding for capital expenditures of approximately million 
additional commitments for capital requirements are expected to be incurred during fiscal cash requirements the company s cash requirements over the next months will be primarily to fund operations  including spending on research and development  capital expenditures and debt service  as well as any cash acquisitions that it may undertake 
the company expects that cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the next months 
however  the company cannot assure that additional sources of financing would be available to the company on commercially favorable terms should the company s capital requirements exceed cash available from operations 
contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies the company s future contractual obligations as of november  in millions payments due in fiscal total thereafter long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total certain transactions the chairman of the board of the company is also the chairman of the board and majority shareholder of a company who is a supplier of secure managed information technology services 
another director of the company is also an employee and a director of this company 
in  the company entered into a fifty two month service contract with this company to provide services to all of the company s worldwide facilities at a cost of approximately million per year 
in  the company has entered into additional contracts with this company ranging from months to months to provide additional services for approximately million per year 
the company incurred expenses of million in and million in related to services provided by this company  of which the amount owed to this company was million at november  and million at november  an officer of the company is also the ceo  president and director of one of the company s majority held subsidiaries that purchases photomask blanks from a company of which he is a significant shareholder 
in  the company purchased million of photomask blanks from this company of which million was owed to this company as of november  the company believes that the terms of the transactions described above with affiliated persons were negotiated at arm s length and were no less favorable to the company than the company could have obtained from non affiliated parties 
application of critical accounting procedures the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect its financial condition and results of operations 
estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in them 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company s estimates are based on the facts and circumstances available at the time  different reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used are likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results reported by the company may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews these estimates periodically and reflects the effect of revisions in the period that they are determined 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company records derivatives on the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
the company uses judgment in assessing the fair value of derivatives and related financial instruments including assumptions utilized in derivative fair value models in such areas as projected interest rates and changes in the company s stock price during the contract term 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
repairs and maintenance as well as renewals and replacements of a routine nature are charged to operations as incurred  while those which improve or extend the lives of existing assets are capitalized 
upon sale or other disposition  the cost of the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years  machinery and equipment over to years and furniture  fixtures and office equipment over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement  whichever is less 
judgment and assumptions are used in establishing estimated useful lives and depreciation periods 
the company also uses judgment and assumptions as it periodically reviews property  plant and equipment for any potential impairment in carrying values whenever events such as a significant industry downturn  plant closures  technological obsolescence or other changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
actual fair values may differ from estimated fair values 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles  and software development costs 
these assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired less accumulated amortization 
amortization is calculated on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of years for software development costs and  prior to november   to years for goodwill and acquisition related assets 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but the future economic benefit of the carrying value of all intangible assets is reviewed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based on discounted cash flows or market factors  an impairment loss would be recorded in the period so determined 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on the company s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes the income tax provision benefit is computed on the basis of consolidated financial statement income or loss before income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income is not expected to be sufficient  the company uses judgment and assumptions to determine if valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets are required by considering future market growth  forecasted operations  future taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
the company considers income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which it operates in order to determine its effective income tax rate 
current income tax exposure is identified along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the actual annual amount of taxable income in each tax jurisdiction may differ from the estimates used to compute the effective income tax rate during the first  second and third quarters 
additionally  the company evaluates the recoverability of deferred income tax assets from future taxable income and establishes valuation allowances if recovery is deemed not likely 
accordingly  the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations is impacted by changes in the valuation allowance 
significant management estimates and judgment are required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of goods to customers 
the company makes estimates and assumptions and uses judgment relating to discounts and estimates for product return and warranties  which are accrued and recognized at the time of sale 
discounts sales discounts are negotiated with customers prior to billing and at the time of billing  sales invoices are prepared net of negotiated sales discounts 
product returns customer returns have historically been insignificant 
however  the company does record a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated sales returns based upon historical experience 
warranties and other post shipment obligations for a day period  the company warrants that items sold will conform to customer specification 
however  the company s liability is limited to repair or replacement of the photomasks at its sole option 
the company inspects photomasks for conformity to customer specifications prior to shipment 
accordingly  customer returns of items under warranty have historically been insignificant 
however  the company records a liability for the insignificant amount of estimated warranty returns based on historical experience 
the company s specific return policies include accepting returns for products with defects  or products that have not been produced to precise customer specifications 
at the time of shipment  a liability is established for these items 
customer acceptance as title and risk of loss pass upon delivery to common carriers or hand delivery to the customer  customer acceptance occurs concurrently with delivery 
arrangements with distributors the company does not sell to distributors 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company is required to use considerable judgment in estimating the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  significant one time events  and historical experience 
effect of new accounting standards in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires that an issuer classify financial instruments that are within its scope as a liability 
many of those instruments were classified as equity under previous guidance 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  on november   the fasb issued fas which deferred the effective date of sfas no 
indefinitely for certain mandatory redeemable non controlling interests 
in addition  on november  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  which states that employee stock ownership plan shares esop which are mandatorily redeemable or free standing agreements to repurchase esop shares are not within the scope of statement management has evaluated the provisions of this statement  and does not believe it has an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company records derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are reported in the statement of operations or as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity  depending on the use of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items during the term of the hedge 
in general  the types of risks hedged are those relating to the variability of future cash flows caused by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company documents its risk management strategy and hedge effectiveness at the inception of and during the term of each hedge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract  which effectively converted million of its fixed rate convertible subordinated notes to a variable rate 
contract payments are made on a libor based variable rate at november  and are received at the fixed rate 
the interest rate swap contract is used to adjust the proportion of total debt that is subject to fixed interest rates 
this contract is considered to be a hedge against interest rate risk of the company s fixed rate debt obligation 
accordingly  the contract has been reflected at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheets and the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged is reflected at an amount equal to the sum of its carrying value plus an adjustment representing the change in fair value of the debt obligation attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged 
in addition  changes during any accounting period in the fair value of the contract  as well as offsetting changes in the adjusted carrying value of the related portion of fixed rate debt being hedged  are recognized as adjustments to interest expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the net effect of this accounting on the company s operations results is that the interest expense portion of fixed rate debt being hedged is generally recorded based on variable rates 
at this time  the company does not have plans to enter into additional interest rate swap contracts  however  at a future point the company may decide to do so 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several major international currencies through its worldwide operations and is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates of such currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the company s sales  operating margins and retained earnings 
the functional currencies of the company s asian subsidiaries are the korean won  new taiwan dollar and singapore dollar 
the functional currencies of the company s european subsidiaries are the british pound and euro 
the company attempts to minimize its risk to foreign currency transaction losses by producing its products in the same country in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital 
however  there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant adverse movement in the value of any foreign currencies against the united states dollar 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
the company s primary net foreign currency exposures as of november  included the korean won and the singapore dollar 
as of november   a adverse movement in the value of these currencies against the united states dollar would have resulted in a net unrealized pre tax loss of million 
the company s exposure to other foreign currency risks include the japanese yen  euro  and british pound and the company does not believe that a change in the exchange rates of these currencies would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest rate risk the majority of the company s borrowings are in the form of its convertible subordinated notes  which bear interest at rates of and and certain foreign secured and unsecured notes payable which bear interest at rates between and 
in addition  the interest rate swap contract discussed above subjects the company to market risk as interest rates fluctuate and impacts the interest payments due on the million notional amount of the contract 
at november   the company had approximately million in variable rate financial instruments which were sensitive to interest rate risk 
the company does not believe a change in interest rates would have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
