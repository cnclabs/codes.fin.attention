introduction german american bancorp the company is a financial services holding company based in jasper  indiana 
the company s common stock is traded on nasdaq s national market system under the symbol gabc 
the company operates five affiliated community banks with retail banking offices in the eight contiguous southwestern indiana counties of daviess  dubois  gibson  knox  martin  perry  pike  and spencer and a business lending center in evansville  indiana

the information in this management s discussion and analysis is presented as an analysis of the major components of the company s operations for the years through and its financial condition as of december  and this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes contained elsewhere in this report  and with the description of business included in item of this report including the cautionary disclosure regarding forward looking statements 
financial and other information by segment is included in note segment information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and is incorporated into this item by reference 
management overview as is the case for many banking organizations  the company s largest source of revenue has historically been  and continues to be  derived from the spread earned between its interest income and interest expense 
as discussed in greater detail below  the company s continued dependence on its interest spread adversely affected operating results  due to the impact of a continuation of a year low in the level of interest rates 
the company s net interest income decreased by nearly million during  a decline of from that earned in  which continued a five year trend of declines in net interest income 
this period of historic low interest rates is dampening the current level of the company s financial performance  and this trend is expected to continue until such time as there is a significant sustained increase in interest rates 
further  the company s net interest income and margin are subject to further downward pressure should interest rates decline from current levels 
conversely  management believes that the company s net interest income and margins will improve if  and when  interest rates once again return to more normal levels in the coming years 
the statements in this paragraph regarding the sensitivity of the company s net interest income and margin to changes in interest rates are forward looking statements  which are subject to numerous uncertainties  actual changes in the company s net interest income and margin on account of interest rate changes may differ materially from the changes that are presently expected due to numerous factors 
as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios  but such computer simulation modeling is based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments  and do not reflect actions that management may take in response to interest rate changes 
in addition  the company s net interest income and margin are subject to change on account of factors unrelated to the relative levels of  or changes in  interest rates  as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in recent years  management has taken steps to enhance and grow its sources of non interest related revenue such as insurance  trust administration  securities brokerage and financial planning in an effort to reduce the company s dependency on its net interest income and net interest spread 
increased commissions and fees from the company s combined banking  insurance  and investment operations were principally responsible for the growth of million  or  in the company s non interest income in from that recorded in the company expects that these non interest related revenue sources will continue to significantly enhance its financial performance in the coming years 
the company also has devoted increased emphasis in recent years to expanding its offering of loans and other products and services to business customers 
measured on a year end basis  commercial agricultural loans grew by in  the fifth consecutive year of double digit growth within this component of the company s balance sheet 
the heightened management efforts to grow this component of the company s customer base is directly attributable to management s belief that business customers  particularly small business customers  will value the company s approach of providing a combination of highly qualified professional financial advisors  local decision making  and customer focused products and services 
management also has endeavored in recent years to improve the company s operating efficiency through enhanced employee productivity and the control of operating expenses  as evidenced by the reduction in the number of full time equivalent employees in and from earlier years 
in summary  management in expects to continue to reduce the company s reliance upon net interest income by increasing its emphasis on products and services that generate fees and commissions 
management also seeks to enhance the company s financial performance by increasing its offering of loans and other products and services to business customers  and operating more efficiently 
stock purchase on march   the company purchased  of its common shares approximately of the number of shares that were then outstanding at per share pursuant to its self tender offer at a total cost  including fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offer  of approximately million 
primarily due to this stock purchase  shareholders equity at december  declined by million  or  from shareholders equity at december   and book value shareholders equity per share declined by or from at december  to at december  the company funded  of the costs of purchasing these shares by borrowing under a revolving line of credit that the parent company established with a correspondent bank lender see sources of funds parent company funding sources below  and the balance by applying cash and investments held by the parent company including cash received in the form of dividend payments by the company from subsidiary companies during the first quarter of at december   the parent company s cash and marketable investments were  a decline of million or  from the parent company s cash and marketable investments at december  accordingly  the purchase of stock pursuant to the tender offer materially affected the liquidity of the parent company  and reduced its equity and increased its debt 
on a consolidated basis  however  the company continued at december   to remain well capitalized as that term is defined by federal banking regulations and its capital levels continued to significantly exceed the minimum required capital levels for each measure of capital adequacy 
see capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial condition and results of operations for german american bancorp presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  are to a large degree  dependent upon the company s accounting policies 
the selection of and application of these policies involve estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are subject to change 
the critical accounting policies and estimates that the company has determined to be the most susceptible to change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of the allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans  and consideration of past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of two components of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial  agricultural and poultry loans are subject to a standardized grading process administered by an internal loan review function 
the need for specific reserves is considered for credits when graded substandard or special mention  or when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 
specific allocations on impaired loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical averages  including those graded substandard or special mention and non performing consumer or residential real estate loans 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans  homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a five year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes a minor unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  lending staff quality  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  and broad portfolio quality trends 
therefore  the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period 
mortgage servicing rights valuation mortgage servicing rights msrs are recognized and included with other assets for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
servicing rights are expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using groupings of the underlying loans as to type and age 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
to determine the fair value of msrs  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
in using this valuation method  the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income  late fees  and float income 
the company periodically validates it valuation model by obtaining an independent valuation of its msrs 
the most significant assumption used to value msrs is prepayment rate 
in general  during periods of declining interest rates  the value of msrs decline due to increasing prepayment speeds attributable to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
prepayment rates are estimated based on published industry consensus prepayment rates 
prepayments will increase or decrease in correlation with market interest rates  and actual prepayments generally differ from initial estimates 
if actual prepayment rates are different than originally estimated  the company may receive less mortgage servicing income  which could reduce the value of the msrs 
other assumptions used in estimating the fair value of msrs do not generally fluctuate to the same degree as prepayment rates  and therefore the fair value of msrs is less sensitive to changes in these other assumptions 
on a quarterly basis  the company evaluates the possible impairment of msrs based on the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value of msrs 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment  the company stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and age 
if temporary impairment exists  a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value  by risk stratification  through a charge to income 
if the company later determines that all or a portion of the temporary impairment no longer exists for a particular strata  a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income 
the company annually reviews msrs for other than temporary impairment and recognizes a direct write down when the recoverability of a recorded valuation allowance is determined to be remote 
in determining whether other than temporary impairment has occurred  the company considers both historical and projected trends in interest rates  prepayment activity within the strata  and the potential for impairment recovery through interest rate increases 
unlike a valuation allowance  a direct write down permanently reduces the carrying value of the msrs and the valuation allowance  precluding subsequent recoveries 
as of december  the company analyzed the sensitivity of its msrs to changes in prepayment rates 
in estimating the changes in prepayment rates  market interest rates were assumed to be increased and decreased by 
at december  the company s msrs had a fair value of  using a weighted average prepayment rate of 
assuming a increase in market interest rates the estimated fair value of msrs was  with a weighted average prepayment rate of 
assuming a decline in market interest rates the estimated fair value of msrs was  with a weighted average prepayment rate of 
results of operations net income in  the company earned net income of  or per share 
earnings for declined by approximately from the  and approximately from the per share reported for a lower number of shares outstanding resulting from the tender offer completed in march produced the lower percentage decline in earnings per share than that experienced in reported net income 
the lower level of earnings during compared to was attributable principally to a decline in net interest income of  and a net loss of  incurred with the prepayment of  of fhlb borrowings 
these significant factors were partially offset by double digit percentage increases in each category of non interest income which totaled  the company s earnings increase compared with was generated primarily by the company s core banking segment 
the company s mortgage banking operations were adversely affected during the fourth quarter and throughout due to the impact of historic low levels of interest rates on the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and net interest income 
the mortgage banking segment experienced net losses of  during compared to nearly break even results in of  net income 
net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws 
net interest income declined during by  or  on a tax equivalent basis compared with net interest margin is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
for  the net interest margin remained relatively stable at compared with for the company s net interest income was adversely impacted by the historically low levels of interest rates during this historically low interest rate environment resulted in a decline in overall earning asset yields including both the loan and securities portfolios 
the decline in interest rates through most of the first three quarters of resulted in increased prepayment speeds in the company s mortgage related securities portfolio  causing increased purchase premium amortization within that portfolio and thereby driving yields lower 
in addition  due to the low level of interest rates  the company was unable to reinvest the proceeds of the mortgage related securities repayments and cash flows from securities issued by state and local subdivisions at comparable yields 
the low level of interest rates has also caused downward pressure on the yield in the company s loan portfolio 
the company s cost of funds has lowered significantly but has not sufficiently mitigated the decline in earning asset yield 
while management believes the current asset sensitive interest rate risk position will allow the company to reap long term benefits from sustained future increases in interest rates  a continuation of market interest rates at current or lower levels will likely result in continued pressure in the near future on the company s net interest income and net interest margin 
the statements in the preceding paragraph are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of readers are cautioned that  by their nature  forward looking statements are based on assumptions and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and other factors 
changes in the company s future net interest income and net interest margin may vary materially from those that are presently expected  due to such factors as the unknown future direction of  and timing and magnitude of  changes in interest rates  the effects of changes in competitive conditions  the introduction  withdrawal  success and timing of asset liability management strategies or of business initiatives and business strategies  changes in customer borrowing  repayment  investment and deposit practices  changes in fiscal  monetary and tax policies  changes in financial and capital markets  changes in general economic conditions  either nationally or regionally  capital management activities  actions of the federal reserve board  and legislative and regulatory actions and reforms 
earning assets declined during compared with and was largely attributable to a decreased residential mortgage loan portfolio and the repayment of fhlb advances within the mortgage banking segment 
the decline in interest earning assets was also attributable  to a lesser degree  to the previously discussed self tender offer and the purchase of company owned life insurance coli during mid the reduction in loans was attributable to the refinance activity in the residential loan industry that has been fueled by the historically low interest rate environment and the company s continued sale of a majority of residential loan production in the secondary markets 
overall  the average loan portfolio declined by million or approximately during compared with average residential mortgage loans declined million or during partially mitigating the decline in average residential mortgage loans was growth in the commercial loan portfolio 
average commercial loans increased by million or during compared with in the second quarter of  the company s mortgage banking segment repaid a maturing fhlb advance in the amount of million 
late in the third quarter of  the mortgage banking segment prepaid million of fhlb advances with an average rate of 
these advances had stated maturities in the third quarter of late in the fourth quarter of  the company s mortgage banking segment prepaid an additional million of fhlb advances with an average rate of 
these advances had stated maturities in the first quarter of over the second half of  these advances were carried at a negative interest rate spread of approximately compared to the short term investments that had been internally matched to the contractual repayment of these advances 
therefore  management believes that the extinguishment of these borrowings will positively impact the net interest margin in future periods 
in addition to the prepayment of the aforementioned borrowings  the mortgage banking segment repaid million of fhlb advances in december these advances matured in december or were scheduled to mature in january these advances were carried at a negative interest rate spread of approximately compared to the short term investments that had been internally matched to the contractual repayment of these advances 
the reduction of this level of earning assets had a positive impact on net interest income during the company purchased million of coli during july coli is an earning asset  however  for financial statement purposes is not considered an interest earning asset 
the increase in cash value on coli is reported in the non interest income section of the consolidated statements of income 
because this million consisted of funds that were previously invested in interest bearing assets  this purchase had a detrimental effect on net interest income  but not necessarily on net income 
net interest income declined modestly during by  or an increase of  on a tax equivalent basis compared with for  the net interest margin remained relatively stable at compared with for the improvement in net interest margin in was primarily attributable to the historically low interest rate environment that enabled the company to significantly lower its cost of funds 
the maturity of higher costing borrowed funds coupled with an increase in transaction deposits savings  money market  and demand deposit accounts were the most significant factors in the lower cost of funds 
an overall decline in interest earning assets primarily due to a lower level of residential mortgage loans and the effects of the low interest rate environment on loan and security yields tempered the effects of the lower cost of funds during the company s net interest income was negatively impacted during by the company s mortgage banking segment 
the mortgage banking segment s net interest income declined by million during compared with the decline resulted from the sale of sub prime residential real estate loans in combined with the prepayment of a significant amount of the segment s portfolio loans and the continued sale of a majority of the company s residential real estate production to the secondary market 
in contrast  the core banking segment s net interest income increased million during  primarily due to the decrease in the cost of funds discussed above 
average loans outstanding including loans held for sale declined million during compared with the decline in loans was attributable primarily to a significant reduction in the company s residential mortgage loan portfolio 
this reduction was attributable to the refinance activity in the residential loan industry due to a historically low interest rate environment and the company s continued sale of a majority of residential loan production to the secondary market 
residential loans declined million during growth in the commercial loan portfolio of million during mitigated the decline in residential loans

provision for loan losses the company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
the provision is affected by net charge offs on loans and changes in specific and general allocations required on the allowance 
provisions for loan losses totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
the provision declined by  during compared with the decline in provision was primarily due to a decline in net charge offs and a decline in the level of non performing assets 
net charge offs totaled  in compared with  in non performing assets declined to  at december  compared with  at year end the composition of the loan portfolio changed during  continuing a trend toward a greater concentration in higher risk commercial and agricultural loans and less concentration in residential mortgage loans 
however  these declines in net charge offs and non performing assets more than offset this change in loan portfolio composition 
the provision for loan losses increased  during primarily due to an increase in internally classified assets and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
the company s allowance for loan losses and subsequent provisions for loan losses are typically analyzed at the individual affiliate bank level  the segment level  and finally at the consolidated level 
during  the core banking segment s provisions for loan loss totaled  while the mortgage banking segment totaled a negative  provision for loan loss 
these totals compare to a provision of  for the core banking segment in and a negative  provision for the mortgage banking segment in during the core banking segment had provision for loan loss of  while the mortgage banking segment had no provision for loan loss 
the increase in and stabilization at approximately the same level during in the core banking segment was predominantly the result of a change in the overall loan portfolio composition to a more heavily concentrated commercial and agricultural mix as noted previously 
during those same periods non performing loans have declined  and during the effect of the decline in non performing loans and net charge offs offset the effect of changes in portfolio composition 
the level of provisions in the mortgage banking segment have been driven by a declining level of portfolio residential real estate loans held by the mortgage banking segment due in large part to a historically low interest rate environment that has caused significant refinancing within the residential loan portfolio 
these provisions were made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb estimated  probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
a detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is completed quarterly by management  the results of which are used to determine provisions for loan losses 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
refer also to the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates and lending and loan administration for further discussion of the provision and allowance for loan losses 
non interest income non interest income increased in all categories increased by double digit percentages 
non interest income declined in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in the company s insurance revenues 
non interest income dollars in thousands change from prior year trust and investment product fees    service charges on deposit accounts    insurance revenues    other operating income    subtotal    net gains on sales of loans and related assets   securities gains losses  net total non interest income    insurance revenues increased in the increased insurance revenues were primarily the result of insurance agency acquisitions completed in late and in september to a lesser degree  internal growth within the company s existing property and casualty insurance operations also contributed to the increase 
the most significant insurance agency acquisitions were completed september  on that date  the company acquired substantially all of the assets  net of certain assumed liabilities  of two property and casualty insurance agencies  hoosierland agency based in jasper  indiana and stafford williams agency based in washington  indiana 
these acquisitions significantly impacted the company s insurance revenues during the property and casualty insurance revenues and expenses associated with these acquisitions are anticipated to have a more significant effect on the company s operations in for more information on business combination  see note business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets 
insurance revenues decreased in the decline in insurance revenues resulted from a decline in contingency income from the company s property and casualty insurance operations and a decline in revenues generated by the company s credit reinsurance operations 
contingency income will fluctuate  as it represents amounts received from insurance companies based on claims experience 
the decline in credit insurance and reinsurance revenues is largely attributable to a decline in consumer loan production and credit insurance sales penetration 
service charges on deposit accounts increased and in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily attributable to the introduction of an overdraft protection service program during the second quarter of trust and investment product fees increased and in and  respectively  due to the formation of german american financial advisors trust company gafa 
gafa was formed mid year to provide expanded financial planning  full service brokerage  trust administration and other financial services 
the formation of gafa provides customers an enhanced ability to fulfill all their financial needs through the company s affiliate banks and associated financial services companies 
other operating income increased in the increase in other operating income is primarily attributable to reduced impairment charges in the mortgage banking segment s mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
rates stabilized during the latter part of facilitating the lower level of impairment charges 
the amount of impairment charged in was  as compared to  in other operating income decreased in the decline was primarily the result of increased impairment adjustments on the mortgage banking segment s mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
the increased impairment adjustments were due to the historically low levels of mortgage loan rates and the significant refinance activity in the residential mortgage loan industry during the gain on sale of loans and related assets increased in and in historically low interest rates fueled relatively strong mortgage loan sales during  and loan sales increased to million in compared with loan sales in of million 
loan sales were stable between and loan sales for were million excluding the sub prime sale discussed in the immediately following sentence 
in february  million of sub prime  out of market residential mortgage loans were sold at a loss of million 
the loans were reclassified as held for sale in december  therefore  the market loss was recognized in non interest expense non interest expense increased in the increase is primarily attributable to increased salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment expense  advertising and promotion and net loss on extinguishment of borrowings 
non interest expense decreased in the decline in resulted primarily from decreased other operating expenses and advertising expenses tempered by an increase in salaries and employee benefits 
non interest expense dollars in thousands change from prior year salaries and employee benefits    occupancy  furniture and equipment expense    fdic premiums data processing fees    professional fees   advertising and promotion  supplies net loss on extinguishment of borrowings  n m other operating expenses    total non interest expense    n m not meaningful salaries and employee benefits comprised approximately of total non interest expense in  in  and in salaries and employee benefits increased in and in in  the increase in salaries and employee benefits resulted from increased expenses associated with retirement benefits and sales related incentive compensation partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation based on overall financial performance 
increased trust and product fees  increased mortgage originations  and increased insurance revenues have contributed to increased sales related incentive pay 
in  the increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven by increases in salary and retirement expenses  incentive compensation and employee insurance benefits 
the increases in salary and retirement benefits were attributable to adjustments occurring in the normal course of operations 
significant earnings improvements in the company s core banking segment resulted in increased employee incentive compensation during occupancy  furniture and equipment expense increased in this increase was partially attributable to increased building depreciation resulting from remodeling at an affiliate bank s main office that was completed during the fourth quarter of increased furniture and equipment depreciation from computer network upgrades  additional workstations for employees through insurance company acquisitions  item processing equipment and other general additions to fixed assets also attributed to the increase in occupancy  furniture and equipment in in addition  software licenses and maintenance agreements increased during in  occupancy  furniture and equipment increased 
this increase resulted primarily from increased building depreciation related to the aforementioned remodeling and increased general expenses 
professional fees increased during and during the increase in is attributable to an increase in general audit and accounting fees 
a significant amount of increased professional fees in resulted from the formation of investment subsidiaries domiciled in the state of nevada by four of the company s subsidiary banks 
the increased professional fees expense was for investment portfolio management services and subsidiary management services provided by third parties 
advertising and promotion expense increased in the increase was partially attributable to the initiation of a television advertising campaign by the company during the increase was also due to general advertising expenses for gafa which was formed in july advertising and promotion expense decreased during this decline was attributable to the initiation of an image campaign by the company in and generally a lower level of advertising and promotional spending in the company s mortgage banking segment prepaid million of fhlb advances in the second half of at a cost of million and prepaid million of fhlb advances in december at a cost of  as previously mentioned in the net interest income section 
other operating expenses increased in  primarily in the company s insurance segment 
the increases were attributable to increased claims incurred and an increased level of insurance reserves at the company s credit reinsurance subsidiary 
in addition  the company s property and casualty acquisition activity during late and in the third quarter resulted in an increased level of intangible amortization during amortization expense for the insurance customer list intangible asset acquired in the third quarter of was  in and is expected to be  for each of the years through see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
other operating expenses decreased in this decrease was the result of several factors 
the company experienced a lower level of operating losses from its affordable housing tax credit limited partnership investments  reduced collection costs in the company s mortgage banking segment and a decreased allowance for insurance reserves required by the company s credit reinsurance subsidiary 
in addition  the company recognized a lower level of amortization expense for intangible assets in the decline in amortization expense for intangible assets resulted from the company s adoption of new accounting guidance in the company ceased amortizing goodwill as a result of this accounting change 
goodwill will be assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified 
provision for income taxes the company records a provision for current income taxes payable  along with a provision for deferred taxes payable in the future 
deferred taxes arise from temporary differences  which are items recorded for financial statement purposes in a different period than for income tax returns 
the company s effective tax rate was   and  respectively  in   and the effective tax rate in all periods is lower than the blended statutory rate of 
the lower effective rate in all periods primarily resulted from the company s tax exempt investment income on securities and loans  and from income tax credits generated by investments in affordable housing projects 
also contributing to the lower effective tax rate in and compared with was income generated by subsidiaries domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional details relative to the company s income tax provision 
capital resources the company and affiliate banks are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications  including well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
the company and all affiliate banks at year end were categorized as well capitalized

while there was an overall decline in the company s securities portfolio  there was significant repayment and purchase activity that occurred during this activity was largely driven by the company s significant allocation in its portfolio to mortgage related securities 
during  interest rates continued at historically low levels  thereby driving significant refinance activity in the residential real estate industry causing high levels of repayments within the company s mortgage related securities portfolio 
see net interest income for a discussion of the impact of this activity on net interest income 
despite the heavy repayment activity  the primary focus of the investment portfolio purchases during continued to be in mortgage related securities 
the mortgage related securities were purchased to provide structured cash flows in what continues to be a historically low interest rate environment 
the company continues to believe that at the proper time  investment in tax advantaged obligations of state and political subdivisions is prudent 
however  in the recent and continuing historically low interest rate environment  investments in these types of securities have not been undertaken 
the amortized cost of investment securities  exclusive of federal funds sold and short term investments  increased million to million at year end compared with million at year end the majority of this increase was the result of the significant decline in federal funds sold and short term investments 
the primary focus of the investment portfolio purchases during was in mortgage related securities  thereby significantly increasing the allocation of these types of securities in the overall portfolio

in addition to the other uses of funds discussed previously  the company had certain long term contractual obligations as of december  these contractual obligations primarily consisted of long term borrowings with the fhlb and bank one  na and lease commitments for certain office facilities

management does believe that core deposits continue to represent a stable and viable funding source for the company s operations  but expects  in large part due to the prolonged historically low interest rate environment that has been experienced  that a portion of non maturity deposits may be less stable for the company in a time of prolonged economic recovery and increased interest rates 
demand  savings and money market deposits have provided a growing source of funding for the company in each of the periods reported 
average demand  savings and money market deposits totaled million or of core deposits in compared with million or in and million or in other time deposits consist of certificates of deposits in denominations of less than  these deposits declined by in both and other time deposits comprised of core deposits in compared with in and in management believes a portion of the decline in other time deposits has migrated to non maturity deposit accounts assisting in the growth of that portion of the company s funding source 
it is believed this migration has been driven by the interest rate environment 
other funding sources federal home loan bank advances and other borrowings represent the company s most significant source of other funding for its bank subsidiaries 
average borrowed funds decreased million or during this decline followed a decline of million or in borrowings comprised   and of total funding sources in   and  respectively 
the decline in average borrowed funds during was primarily the result of repayment of fhlb advances  primarily by the company s mortgage banking segment  during the fourth quarter of and throughout during those periods the company s mortgage banking segment has repaid approximately million of fhlb advances 
in some instances these advances were paid prior to maturity 
see net interest income and non interest expense for a discussion of the impact of these prepayments on the company s results of operations 
certificates of deposits in denominations of  or more and brokered deposits are an additional source of other funding for the company s bank subsidiaries 
large denomination certificates and brokered deposits decreased million or during following a decline of million or in large certificates and brokered deposits comprised of total funding sources in   and the bank subsidiaries of the company also utilize short term funding sources from time to time 
these sources consist of overnight federal funds purchased from other financial institutions  secured repurchase agreements that generally mature within days  and secured overnight variable rate borrowings from the fhlb 
these borrowings represent an important source of short term liquidity for the bank subsidiaries of the company 
long term debt is in the form of fhlb advances  which are secured by the pledge of certain investment securities and residential mortgage loans

parent company funding sources the company is a corporation separate and distinct from its bank and other subsidiaries 
for information regarding the financial condition  result of operations  and cash flows of the company  presented on a parent company only basis  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the company does not have access at the parent company level to the sources of funds that are available to its bank subsidiaries to support their operations 
the company derives most of its parent company revenues from dividends  fees  and interest paid to the parent company by its bank subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to statutory restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
the frb possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries that enable it to prevent or remedy actions that in its view may represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
among these powers is the ability in appropriate cases to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies 
the fdic and dfi possess similar enforcement powers over the bank subsidiaries of the company 
the prompt corrective action provisions of federal banking law impose further restrictions on the payment of dividends by insured banks which fail to meet specified capital levels and  in some cases  their parent bank holding companies 
in conjunction with the self tender offer the company completed on march   the parent company entered into a borrowing agreement with a correspondent bank lender  bank one  na  chicago  illinois for the purpose of funding stock repurchases and parent company working capital needs 
the borrowing arrangement is a revolving line of credit for up to million with interest payable quarterly at a rate of day libor plus with an additional commitment fee for the unused portion of the line of credit 
the borrowing matures in march the company initially borrowed million under the terms of the loan at the time the tender offer was completed 
at december  the balance of the parent company borrowing remained million 
risk management the company is exposed to various types of business risk on an on going basis 
these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s affiliate banks to monitor and mitigate risk in their loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s affiliate banks 
loan personnel at each bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
executive and board loan committees active at each bank serve as vehicles for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
these committees provide valuable input to lending personnel  act as an approval body  and monitor the overall quality of the banks loan portfolios 
the corporate loan committee  comprised of members of the company s executive officers and board of directors  strive to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk weighting and loan review program for its affiliate banks  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable credit losses identified during its loan review process 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgement  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b general reserves for certain loan categories and industries  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on performance trends in the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors that influence the level of estimated probable losses 
the need for specific reserves are considered for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring

the increase in specific allocations resulted primarily from commercial and agricultural loan growth  which includes larger credits and the reclassification of individual loans identified in the company s comprehensive risk weighting and loan review program 
the trend in the decline in residential mortgage loan allocations has resulted from the trend of declining net charge offs and the lower concentration of this type of loans 
net charge offs declined over the past three years 
the improved trend has been primarily attributable to declines in residential mortgage and consumer loan charge offs 
commercial and industrial and agricultural and poultry charge offs have not varied significantly over the past three years 
the declining trend in net charge offs began during the increase in net charge offs in was primarily related to sub prime  out of market residential real estate loans at the company s mortgage banking division 
the company discontinued new sub prime  out of market residential real estate lending during  and the portfolio of these loans was sold in please see provision for loan losses in the discussion regarding the results of operations and allowance for loan losses in the discussion regarding critical accounting policies and estimates 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due ninety days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful 
uncollected interest accrued in the current year is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non accrual 
loans are charged off at days past due  or earlier if deemed uncollectible 
exceptions to the non accrual and charge off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table presents an analysis of the company s non performing assets 
non performing assets trended down in each of the past three years 
non performing loans have also trended downward in each of the past three years representing  and of total loans respectively in   and the decline in non accrual loans in and unfavorable trend in non accrual loans prior to was primarily attributable to sub prime  out of market residential real estate loans 
the repositioning of the balance sheet regarding these types of loans during the fourth quarter of and subsequent sale of this sub prime residential portfolio during the first quarter of reversed the upward trend in non accrual loans 
the level of non performing assets is considered relatively low and manageable within the company s normal course of business

accounting standards require recognition of loan impairment if a loan s full principal or interest payments are not expected to be received 
loans considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows or to the fair value of collateral  by allocating a portion of the allowance for loan losses to such loans 
the total dollar amount of impaired loans at december  was  for additional detail on impaired loans  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the ability of the company s subsidiary banks to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  as enhanced by its ability to draw upon a line of credit established by the parent company in march with a correspondent bank lender  as described under sources of funds parent company funding sources  above 
the affiliate banks source of funding is predominately core deposits  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
funds management committees at the holding company and each affiliate bank monitor compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy 
see the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk section for further discussion regarding interest rate risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and boards of directors of the holding company and its affiliate banks 
primary market risks  which impact the company s operations  are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to increase in the event of an increase in prevailing interest rates  and might be expected to decrease in the event of a decrease in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands
