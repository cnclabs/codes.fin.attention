item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business consists of four business segments magazine fulfillment  in store services  wood manufacturing and shared services 
our segment reporting is structured based on the reporting of senior management to the chief executive officer 
our magazine fulfillment group uses our proprietary order regulation technology to manage the distribution of magazines to over  retail outlets 
we assist retailers with the selection  logistical procurement and fulfillment of approximately  monthly and weekly magazine titles from over publishers 
the group was established in may with the acquisition of the interlink companies  inc or interlink  and its two operating subsidiaries international periodical distributors  inc and david e 
young  inc 
the scope of the group s operations was expanded via agreements giving us the right to export domestic titles for sale internationally and import foreign titles for sale domestically 
our in store services group assists retailers with the design and implementation of their front end area merchandise programs  which generally have a three year life cycle 
we provide other value added services to retailers  publishers and other vendors 
these services include assisting retailers with the filing of claims for publisher incentive payments  which are based on display location or total retail sales  and providing publishers with access to real time sales information on more than  magazine titles  thereby enabling them to make more informed decisions regarding their product placement  cover treatments and distribution efforts 
our wood manufacturing group designs and manufactures wood display and store fixtures for leading specialty retailers 
our shared services group consists of overhead functions not allocated to the other groups 
these functions include corporate finance  human resource  management information systems and executive management that are not allocated to the three operating groups 
upon completion of our consolidation of our administrative operations  we restructured our accounts to separately identify corporate expenses that are not attributable to any of our three main operating groups 
prior to fiscal year  these expenses were included within our in store services group 
comparable information is not available and is not presented for prior fiscal years 
revenues the magazine fulfillment group derives revenues from selling and distributing magazines  including domestic and foreign titles  to major specialty retailers and wholesalers throughout the united states and canada  exporting domestic titles internationally to foreign wholesalers or through domestic brokers  serving as a secondary national distributor  providing return processing services for major specialty retail book chains  and serving as an outsourced fulfillment agent and backroom operator for publishers 
the in store services group derives revenues from designing  manufacturing and invoicing participants in front end merchandising programs  providing claim filing services related to rebates owed retailers from publishers or their designated agents  shipping  installing and removing front end fixtures  and providing information and management services relating to magazine sales to retailers and publishers throughout the united states and canada 
the wood manufacturing group derives revenues from designing  manufacturing and installing custom wood fixtures primarily for retailers 
over the last three fiscal years  a majority of the growth of our revenues has come from our magazine fulfillment group 
we anticipate this trend to continue in the future 
the growth has been driven by the inception of our import and export businesses as well as the growth in our core domestic wholesale distribution business 
we see opportunities for growth in our in store services group being driven primarily by the expansion of our claim filing services business and expansion of our international operations  primarily in the united kingdom 
we see opportunities for growth in our wood manufacturing group from leveraging our relationships with the retailers we service in our other two operating groups 
cost of revenues our cost of revenues for the magazine fulfillment group consists of the costs of magazines purchased for resale less all applicable publisher discounts and rebates 
our cost of revenues for the in store services and the wood manufacturing groups includes raw materials consumed in the production of display fixtures  primarily steel  wood and plastic components  production labor  and manufacturing overhead 
cost of revenues has increased since the inception of our magazine fulfillment group 
as primarily a wholesale operation  the magazine fulfillment group traditionally has a lower gross profit margin than our in store services group  which provided the bulk of our revenues before the interlink acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for each of the operating groups include non production labor  rent and office overhead  insurance  professional fees  and management information systems 
expenses associated with corporate finance  human resources  management information systems and executive offices are included within the shared services group and are not allocated to the other groups 
selling  general and administrative expenses have increased since the inception of our magazine fulfillment group 
we believe we now have the infrastructure in place to support our existing operations as well as support a significant amount of domestic growth 
we continue to actively search for cost savings from consolidation to offset growth in other areas such as insurance  professional fees  and normal cost of living increases 
fulfillment freight fulfillment freight consists of our direct costs of distributing magazines by third party freight carriers  primarily federal express ground service 
freight rates are driven by the weight of the copies being shipped and the distance between origination and destination 
fulfillment freight is not disclosed as a component of cost of revenues  and  as a result  gross profit and gross profit margins are not comparable to other companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of revenues 
fulfillment freight has increased proportionately as the amount of product we distribute has increased 
we anticipate the continued growth in our magazine fulfillment group will result in an increase in fulfillment freight 
generally  as pounds shipped increase  the cost per pound charged by third party carriers decreases 
as a result  fulfillment freight as a percent of magazine fulfillment group revenue should decline slightly in the future 
relocation expenses relocation expenses consist primarily of the cost of transferring existing employees and offices from their former locations in high point  north carolina  st 
louis  missouri  and san diego  california  to our new offices in bonita springs  florida

operating cash flows in fiscal were primarily from net income million  plus non cash charges including depreciation and amortization million and provisions for losses on accounts receivable million  a decrease in accounts receivable million and a decrease in other current and non current assets million 
these cash providing activities were offset by an increase in inventory million  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses other current and non current liabilities million 
accounts receivable and accounts payable balances were impacted by the inception of the magazine export business  which had trade receivable of million and trade payables of million at january  the magazine export agreement allowed us to become a leading exporter of domestic titles to foreign wholesalers and domestic brokers who transport the product overseas 
the fiscal year includes eleven months of operations from this business and only eight months of cash collections due to standard payment terms of at least days  which is typical in the industry 
accounts receivable related to our domestic magazine distribution businesses decreased million primarily due to the increase in the sales return reserve partially offset by the growth in trade receivables as a result of higher distribution levels 
inventories for this business increased million primarily to support higher distribution levels 
accounts receivable in our front end fixture manufacturing and claim filing services decreased million due to both better collection procedures as well as the lower revenue base 
operating cash flow in fiscal was primarily from net income million  adding back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization million and provisions for losses on accounts receivable million and a significant decrease in accounts receivable million 
these cash providing activities were offset by a significant reduction in accounts payable million 
the decrease in accounts receivable relates primarily to a significant decrease in receivables related to front end fixture programs  which were at unusually high levels at january  and subsequently collected in the first quarter of fiscal the decrease in receivables related to front end fixture programs relates primarily to the timing of payments by significant participants of cost shared front end fixture programs 
our year end balance at january  was inflated by the significantly higher revenue in the third quarter of fiscal that was  for the most part  collected in the first quarter of fiscal improved cash flow and profits in our magazine distribution group allowed for a significant reduction in accounts payable million of the total decrease 
we believe that this decrease was necessary to bring us within payment terms with all our publishers  which has significantly improved our relationship with the publishing community and allowed us to expand our business with those publishers 
negative operating cash flow in fiscal was million despite a net loss of million 
the difference related to significant non cash charges including depreciation and amortization million  provisions for losses on accounts receivable million and an asset impairment charge million 
in addition to the non cash charges we also experienced a significant increase in accounts payable million  which increased cash flow from operations 
this increase related to our recently purchased interlink subsidiaries and an increase in the average days outstanding to our vendors 
these increases were offset by a significant increase in accounts receivable million and inventories million 
the increase in accounts receivable was attributable to both the purchase of the interlink companies and a significant amount of third quarter wire manufacturing revenues not collected until the first quarter of fiscal investing cash flow net cash used in investing activities was  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities related to capital expenditures of million  which primarily related to our relocation to florida and expansion of our distribution facility in harrisburg  pennsylvania  and million of payments related to acquisition of the customer lists under the import and export agreement 
our advance pay program generated net cash flow of million in fiscal the company also advanced to the prior operator of our export distribution business million 
the advances were made as part of the agreement to collect the prior operator s receivables and pay outstanding payables so as to create a seamless transition for both the customers and suppliers 
this balance had decreased to approximately million at march  in fiscal  cash used in investing activities related to capital expenditures of million  which related primarily to our relocation to florida  the acquisition of innovative metal fixtures million of a total purchase price of approximately million  the remaining portion consisting of a note payable to the former owner and a payment under a magazine import agreement million related to the domestic distribution of foreign titles 
our advance pay program used net cash flow of million 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities related to the acquisition of interlink totaling million and capital expenditures of million 
cash from investing activities included million from the sale of software 
our advance pay program provided net cash flow of million 
the unusually high cash flow from the advance pay program was due to improvement in the collection process 
the faster collection cycle for our claim receivables resulted from providing publishers with the claim information in an electronic format allowing for quicker processing 
as a result of this new process  claims outstanding related to our advance pay program decreased compared to the prior fiscal year end  without a significant decrease in either the number or amount of claims filed 
our borrowing agreements limit the amount of our capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
financing cash flow outstanding balances on our credit facility fluctuate partially due to the timing of the retailer rebate claiming process and our advance pay program  the seasonality of our wire manufacturing business  and the payment cycle of the magazine distribution business 
because the magazine distribution business and advance pay program cash requirement peak at our fiscal quarter ends  the reported bank debt levels usually are the maximum level outstanding during the quarter 
payments under our advance pay program generally occur just prior to our fiscal quarter end 
the related claims are not generally collected by us until days after the advance is made 
as a result  our funding requirements peak at the time of the initial advances and decrease over the next days as the cash is collected on the related claims 
the wire manufacturing business is seasonal because most retailers prefer initiating new programs before the holiday shopping season begins  which concentrates revenues in the second and third quarter 
receivables from these fixture programs are generally collected from all participants within days 
we are usually required to tender payment on the costs of these programs raw material and labor within a shorter period 
as a result  our funding requirements peak in the second and third fiscal quarters when we manufacture the wire fixtures and decrease significantly in the fourth and first fiscal quarters as the related receivable are collected and significantly less manufacturing activity is occurring 
within our magazine distribution business  our significant customers pay weekly  and we pay our suppliers monthly 
as a result  funding requirements peak at the end of the month when supplier payments are made and decrease over the course of the next month as our receivables are collected 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was   and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash used in financing activities related to our various credit facilities included net repayments under revolving credit facilities of million  payments of notes payable of million and proceeds from the issuance of notes payable of million

in addition  we repaid approximately million of various notes outstanding to the prior owners of acquired companies 
outstanding checks increased million relating to the timing of our payments to retailers under the advance pay program 
at january   we had completed the filing of the quarterly rebate claims and had just processed a large number of payments  which was not the case at the end of in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities related to borrowing under our revolving credit facility totaling million 
these borrowing were partially offset by a million reduction of checks issued and outstanding at january  compared to this amount is driven primarily by the timing of our advance pay program  which requires significant cash outflows near our fiscal year end 
debt at january   our total debt obligations were million  excluding outstanding letters of credit  a decrease of million from the prior year 
during fiscal  we replaced our two existing credit facilities with bank of america and congress financial with a new credit facility with wells fargo foothill and a subordinated note payable to hilco capital 
debt consists of our revolving credit facility with wells fargo foothill that we use to fund our short term financing needs  long term notes to wells fargo foothill and hilco capital  amounts owed related to the magazine import agreement  and a note payable to the former owners of an acquired company 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo foothill 
the credit agreement enables us to borrow up to million under a revolving credit facility and provides a million term note payable 
the credit agreement expires on october  borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the primate rate at january  plus up to based on an availability calculation and carries a facility fee of per annum on the difference between million and the average principal amount outstanding under the facility including advances under the revolving credit facility and letters of credit 
availability under the revolving facility is limited by a borrowing base calculation  as defined in the agreement 
the calculation resulted in excess availability of million at january  the term note payable bears interest at a rate equal to the prime rate at january  plus 
the note is payable in equal principal installments of thousand per month plus current interest 
the terms of the note require accelerated prepayment if certain events occur which generate cash outside of the normal course of business including such things as the sale of a significant asset or proceeds from stock sales 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement with hilco capital 
the note payable has a face value of million and has been recorded net of the original issuance discount related to the fair value of warrants issued concurrently with the note 
the note payable bears current interest at a rate equal to the greater of the prime rate at january  plus or and deferred interest of due at the termination of the agreement on october  under the credit agreements  we are required to maintain a specified minimum level of ebitda and compliance with specified fixed charge coverage and debt to ebitda ratios 
in addition  we are prohibited  without consent from our lenders  from incurring or suffering to exist additional indebtedness or liens on our assets  engaging in any merger  consolidation  acquisition or disposition of assets or other fundamental corporate change  permitting a change of control of our company  paying any dividends or making any other distribution on capital stock or other payments in connection with the purchase  redemption  retirement or acquisition of capital stock  changing our fiscal year or methods of accounting  and making capital expenditures in excess of million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year 
we were in compliance with each of these financial and operating covenants at january  amounts owed related to the magazine export agreement consist of quarterly payments of thousand beginning in january a note payable in the principal amount of million to the previous owner of an acquired company is past due and is being disputed under the conditions of the acquisition agreement 
we received a favorable arbitration ruling during the fourth quarter  which lowered the amount owed from the prior fiscal year 
subsequent to year end  we settled the remaining note payable and interest accrued thereon for million 
subsequent to year end  we completed a sale of million shares of our common stock 
the proceeds million after the underwriting discount but before related expenses from the sale were utilized to repay the term loan portion of the wells fargo foothill credit facility as well as pay off all but a nominal amount of the hilco capital note payable 
the remaining balance was utilized to pay down the outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility and increase our cash reserves by approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we record a reduction in revenue for estimated magazine sales returns and a reduction in cost of sales for estimated magazine purchase returns 
estimated sales returns are based on historical sales returns and daily point of sale data from significant customers 
the purchase return estimate is calculated from the sales return reserve based on historical gross profit 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future results  revenue and or cost of sales may be misstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on customer specific information and historical collection experience 
if market conditions decline  actual collection experience may not meet expectations and may result in increased bad debt expenses 
taxes on earnings the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expenses or benefits 
goodwill we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the determination of whether or not goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of the reporting units 
changes in our strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
we have adopted a policy to review each reporting unit for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach that uses forward looking information regarding market share  revenues and costs for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates 
as a result  changes in these assumptions and current working capital could materially change the outcome of each reporting unit s fair value determinations in future periods  which could require a permanent write down of goodwill 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the estimates that we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying business 
if we fail to achieve our estimates  we may incur a future charge for impairment of goodwill 
long lived assets with the exception of goodwill  long lived assets such as intangibles and property and equipment  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their eventual dispositions is less than their carry a mount 
impairment  if any  if assessed using discounted cash flows 
the determination of whether or not long lived assets have become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in developing the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of those assets 
changes in our strategy  assumptions and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of long lived assets
