item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read with our financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains trend analysis and might contain forward looking statements 
these statements are based on current expectations and actual results might differ materially 
among the factors that could cause actual results to vary are those described in this overview section and in business risk factors that might affect future results 
we provide central processing and supply chain management services to hospitals and surgery centers throughout the united states 
our revenue growth is primarily determined by our number of customers  the number and type of surgical procedures that we service for each customer  and pricing for our various types of surgical packs and procedures 
our revenue growth and efficiency in delivering products and services to customers primarily determine our profitability 
in  our revenues were consistent with the prior two years 
we experienced an adverse impact on our operating profit margins principally because of increased costs in several areas and pricing pressures from competitors offering disposable alternatives to our reusable products 
our successful efforts to add new customers and increase revenues at existing accounts were offset by customer losses in and consequently  we suffered an annual loss for the first time since becoming a public company in we responded last year with strategic measures designed to strengthen and build our customer relationships and upgrade our staff  facilities  and internal processes  efforts that we believe set the foundation for improved results in and coming years 
these include the following building existing customer relationships 
with our full case cart service  we have opportunities to expand the services that we furnish to existing customers so that we serve all of their surgical procedure needs 
in june  we joined with our strategic partner  aesculap  in entering into a new service and supply agreement with 
table of contents an existing customer rex healthcare  inc  a major healthcare system in raleigh  north carolina 
the agreement considerably increased the scope of our customer relationship with rex healthcare  especially with respect to instrument reprocessing 
we provide supply chain management services  including surgical instruments processing and physician specific procedure case cart delivery 
our case carts contain all medical supplies used during a surgical procedure including high quality surgical instruments 
processing of all surgical instruments  provided by aesculap  occurs at either our facility or in the central sterile processing department at rex healthcare  which our employees manage 
this agreement extends through june  we continue to seek and consider similar strategic relationships  including complementing our reusable surgical product offerings with instrument services and full case cart management at other existing customers 
improved processes 
in january  we completed the successful implementation of radio frequency identification rfid technology in our ten processing facilities  a process commenced in the fourth quarter of we believe that this is among the first full integration of rfid technology into class ii medical devices and among the largest uses to date of multi read applications of rfid technology 
rfid technology is a method for identifying and tracking objects in different environments based on the use of a small tag or transponder that stores a unique code  together with additional information that the user may specify 
a reader is used both to transmit a signal to a tag and retrieve stored information from it  no contact or line of sight is required  and long operating ranges are possible 
the incorporation of multi read rfid tags into over one million of our reusable surgical gowns and drapes allows us to eliminate the use of labor intensive bar code scanning to track product usage 
this technology offers us improved inventory control and monitoring of product quality 
we anticipate realizing productivity enhancements over our bar code scanning results 
facility consolidation 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we consolidated the operations of our detroit facility into our cincinnati facility 
we converted the detroit facility into a service center that distributes products to our customers in that market 
we recognized exit costs totaling approximately  for employee severance and benefit costs and equipment impairment during in this consolidation 
approximately production employees worked through the completion of the consolidation and received severance and benefits 
we expect the consolidation to provide labor and other operational savings starting in during the second quarter of  we closed our boston service center when we terminated service to our sole customer in that market  recognizing exit costs of approximately  for employee termination costs  contract termination costs  and inventory obsolescence to close this service center 
approximately eight production employees worked through the completion of the consolidation and received severance and benefits 
we subleased the building to an unrelated third party for the remaining lease term 
although we have no immediate plans to consolidate or close any other facilities  we continue to evaluate ways to upgrade and improve our operations and our facilities to better serve our customers service and product needs 
upgrade staff and facilities 
in  we determined that one of our most effective marketing programs would be to invite existing and potential customers to visit our operating facilities  review our production processes  and meet our employees 
we dedicated resources for a one time initiative to improve the appearance of our facilities  remove any poor quality gowns from our production process  and upgrade our personnel 
we also added new leadership in sales  marketing  and operations at corporate  as well as  in our processing facilities 
we believe that improvements to our sales and marketing organization in offer us good opportunities for revenue growth with new and existing customers in we believe that improvements to our operations organization will allow us to better leverage the capacity and functionality of our operating facilities 
we continue to seek staff and facility improvement opportunities to complement our existing resources and make our business more effective and efficient 
our principal strategic opportunity to improve our operating results is to leverage our considerable infrastructure by adding revenues from existing and new customers 
our existing facilities currently operate at approximately to of their aggregate annual revenue capacity and provide ample room for business growth without incremental capital investment 

table of contents we incur most of our cost of revenues from processing the reusable surgical products instruments and linens at our processing facilities 
we also amortize the cost of our reusable surgical products that we own and supply to customers over their expected useful life 
our instrument supply arrangements use instruments owned by aesculap  which receives an agreed upon fee for each procedure based on the number and kinds of procedures performed with its instruments and the number and combination of instruments used for each procedure 
this arrangement allows us to limit our cost of capital for instrument programs 
we substantially reduced the balance of our line of credit from million as of december  to million as of december   principally because of our management of accounts payable and inventory and unusually low expenditures for reusable surgical products 
our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were much lower than in previous years 
we do not expect to sustain this cash benefit at these levels as capital expenditures and expenditures for reusable surgical products will return to levels prior to see liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions 
note b to our financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods that we use in preparing our financial statements 
we identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparing our financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the overall aging of our accounts receivable 
if a major customer s creditworthiness deteriorates or actual defaults run at a rate higher than historical experience  we would be required to increase this allowance  which could adversely affect our results of operation 
amortization of reusable products 
we state our reusable surgical products at cost and compute amortization on a basis similar to the units of production method 
we estimate the useful lives for each product based on our estimate of the total number of uses for which the product will be available 
we estimate that our products using the three principal fabrics accounting for of the reusable surgical products will be available for   and uses  based on several factors  including our actual experience with these products 
if our actual use experience with these products is shorter than these assumptions  our amortization rates for reusable products would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operation 
reserves for shrinkage  obsolescence and scrap for reusable surgical products 
we determine our reserves for shrinkage  obsolescence and scrap of our reusable products by tracking those products with our bar coding system or recently implemented rfid system 
based on historical experience  we believe that any products not scanned by the system for a day period are lost 
if actual losses exceed our estimates  our reserve for shrinkage  obsolescence and scrap would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operation 
reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence for inventories 
we determine our reserves for shrinkage and obsolescence of our inventories based on historical results  including the results of cycle counts performed during the year and the evaluation of the aging of finished goods of reusable surgical products and disposable packs 
if actual losses exceed our estimates and assumptions  our inventory reserves would increase  which could adversely affect our results of operation 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we review our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise using the process prescribed in 
table of contents sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment analysis is based on assumptions of future results made by management  including revenues and cash flows 
circumstances that may lead to impairment of goodwill include unforeseen decreases in future performance or demand  or the restructuring of our operations as a result of a change in our strategy 
any impairment could adversely affect our results of operations

in  we dedicated resources to complete an initiative to remove worn and poor quality gowns from our production process  which negatively impacted amortization of reusable surgical products 
our net cash used in investing activities decreased million for the year ended december  to million from million in the year ended december  the decrease is due to a reduction in purchases of property  plant and equipment and reusable surgical products  because of sizable purchases of reusable surgical products in we spent million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  to purchase property  plant and equipment 
we spent million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  to purchase reusable surgical products 
we estimate that our expenditures for property  plant and equipment approximately to million and reusable surgical products approximately to million will increase to approximately to million for the next twelve months as we resume normal purchases of reusable surgical products and capital expenditures in our facilities 
this amount will fluctuate depending on the growth of our business  however
