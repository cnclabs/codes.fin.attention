general msc industrial direct co  inc together with its consolidated subsidiaries  msc or the company or we  incorporated in the state of new york in  is one of the largest direct marketers of a broad range of industrial products to industrial customers throughout the united states 
we distribute a full line of industrial products intended to satisfy our customers maintenance  repair and operations mro supplies requirements 
we offer over  stock keeping units skus through our master catalogs  weekly  monthly and quarterly specialty and promotional catalogs  newspapers and brochures and the internet  including our website mscdirect 
com  and service our customers from approximately branch offices and four distribution centers 
most of our products are carried in stock  and orders for these in stock products are typically fulfilled the day on which the order is received 
our business strategy is to provide an integrated  lower cost solution to the purchasing  management and administration of our customers mro needs 
we believe we add value to our customers purchasing process by reducing their total mro supplies costs  taking into account both the direct cost of products and the administrative  personnel and financial cost of obtaining and maintaining mro supplies 
we try to achieve this reduction in mro supplies costs in the following manner our extensive product offerings allow customers to reduce the administrative burden of dealing with many suppliers for their mro needs 
we guarantee same day shipping of our core business products  which enables our customers to reduce their inventory investment and carrying costs 
we consolidate multiple purchases into a single order  provide a single invoice relating to multiple purchases over varying periods of time and offer direct shipments to specific departments and personnel within a single facility or multiple facilities  allowing our customers to reduce administrative paperwork  costs of shipping and personnel costs related to internal distribution and purchase order management 
we have extensive e commerce abilities that enable our customers to lower their procurement costs 
this includes many features such as swift search and transaction abilities  access to real time inventory  customer specific pricing  workflow management tools  customized reporting and other features 
we can also interface directly with many purchasing portals such as ariba and i procure in addition to erp procurement solutions such as oracle and sap 
we offer inventory management solutions with our customer managed inventory cmi and vendor managed inventory vmi systems that can lower customers inventory investment  reduce sourcing costs and out of stock situations and increase business efficiency 
orders generated through these inventory management solutions are integrated directly with mscdirect 
com and many e procurement software solutions 
our customers include a wide range of purchasers of industrial supply products  from one person machine shops to fortune companies  to government agencies including the united states postal service usps 
our core business focuses on selling relatively higher margin  lower volume products and we had an average order size of approximately in fiscal as our national account and government programs sales grow  the company will face continued pressures on maintaining gross margin because these customers receive lower pricing due to their higher sales volumes 
we have in excess of  combined active customers companies that have purchased at least one item during the past months 
our customers select desired products from msc s various publications and place their orders by telephone  the internet  including mscdirect 
com  direct computer link or facsimile 
we operate primarily in the united states  with customers in all states  through a network of four regional distribution centers and approximately branch offices 
msc s distribution centers are located near harrisburg  pennsylvania  atlanta  georgia  elkhart  indiana and reno  nevada 
the strategic locations of msc s distribution centers allow for next day ground delivery via low cost ground carriers in states 
our experience has been that areas accessible by next day ground delivery generate significantly greater sales than areas where next day ground delivery is not available 
accordingly  our long term strategy is to expand our geographic coverage of next day ground delivery throughout the continental united states which at some point in the future may require the expansion of existing facilities or the opening of new facilities 
industry overview msc operates in a large  fragmented industry characterized by multiple channels of distribution 
we believe that there are numerous small retailers  dealerships and distributors  most of which have annual sales of less than million  that supply a majority of the market 
the distribution channels in the industrial products market include retail outlets  small distributorships  national  regional and local distributors  direct mail suppliers  large warehouse stores and manufacturers own sales forces 
almost every industrial  manufacturing and service business has an ongoing need for mro supplies 
we believe that  except in the largest industrial plants  mro supplies inventories generally are not effectively managed or monitored  resulting in higher purchasing costs and increased administrative burdens 
in addition  within larger facilities  such items are frequently stored in multiple locations  resulting in excess inventories and duplicate purchase orders 
mro items are also frequently purchased by multiple personnel in uneconomic quantities and a substantial portion of most facilities mro supplies are one time purchases  resulting in higher purchasing costs and time consuming administrative efforts by multiple plant personnel 
we believe that the administrative costs associated with manually placing a purchase order can be in excess of per order based on industry estimates 
awareness of these high costs and purchasing inefficiencies has been driving large companies to streamline the purchasing process by utilizing a limited number of suppliers which can provide a broad selection of products  prompt delivery and superior customer service 
customized billing practices and report generation capabilities tailored to customer objectives are also becoming increasingly important to customers seeking to reduce costs  allowing such customers to significantly reduce the need for purchasing agents and administrative personnel 
we believe that industry trends and economic pressures have caused customers to reduce their supplier base and move toward more efficient cost saving models  such as those offered by premier companies such as msc 
despite the inefficiencies of the traditional mro purchasing process  long standing relationships with local retailers and distributors have generally perpetuated the status quo 
due to limited capital availability  high operating cost structures and relatively small sales volumes  suppliers to the industrial market are experiencing increasing pressure to consolidate and curtail services and certain product lines in order to remain competitive 
even large suppliers with extensive field sales forces are finding it increasingly difficult to visit all buyers cost effectively and provide the support necessary to satisfy customer demands for control of costs and improved efficiency 
we believe that the relative inability of traditional distribution channels to respond to these changing industry dynamics has created a continuing opportunity for the growth of direct marketing organizations such as msc 
as a result of these dynamics  we have captured an increasing share of sales by providing lower total purchasing costs  broader product selection and a higher level of service 
we believe that we provide a low cost solution to the purchasing inefficiencies and high costs described above 
customers that purchase products from us will generally find that their total purchasing and shipping costs  inventory investment and carrying costs  internal distribution costs and administrative inefficiencies are reduced 
we try to achieve this through consolidation of multiple sources of supply into fewer suppliers  consolidation of multiple purchase orders into a single purchase order  consolidation of multiple invoices into a single invoice  significant reduction in tracking of invoices  significant reduction in stocking decisions  reduction of purchases for inventory  e commerce capabilities 
business strategy our business strategy is to reduce our customers total cost of procurement for obtaining and maintaining mro supplies 
the strategy includes the following key elements a broad selection of in stock products  offering both name brand and generic products  prompt response and same day shipping  superior  value added customer service  competitive pricing  targeted direct mail marketing  and a commitment to technological innovation 
broad selection of products 
we believe that our ability to offer customers a broad spectrum of brand name and generic mro products and a good better best product selection alternative has been critical to our success 
we offer similar products with varying degrees of name recognition  quality and price  thus permitting the customer to choose the appropriate product based on cost  quality and the customer s specific needs 
our customers are increasingly purchasing from fewer suppliers to reduce the administrative burden of ordering from multiple suppliers 
by offering for sale over  products  most of which generally are in stock and available for immediate shipment  we aim to provide a broad range of merchandise in order to become our customers preferred supplier of mro products 
same day shipping 
our guaranteed same day shipping of products results in delivery the next day or second day for customers in most of the continental united states 
this prompt delivery allows customers to reduce the administrative burden of dealing with many suppliers and reduces their inventory investment and carrying costs 
we fulfill our same day shipment guarantee more than of the time 
our experience has been that areas accessible by next day ground delivery will generate significantly greater sales than areas where next day ground delivery is not available 
the strategic locations of our distribution centers allow next day ground delivery via low cost ground carriers in states 
superior customer service 
customer service is a key element in becoming a customer s preferred provider of mro supplies 
our commitment to customer service is demonstrated by our investment in sophisticated information systems and extensive training of our associates 
utilizing our proprietary customer support software  our in bound sales representatives implement the one call does it all philosophy 
in bound sales representatives are able to inform customers on a real time basis of the availability of a product  recommend substitute products  verify credit information  receive special  custom or manufacturer direct orders  cross check inventory items using customer product codes previously entered into our information systems and arrange technical assistance 
we believe that our simple  one call method of fulfilling all purchasing needs of a customer through highly trained customer service representatives  supported by our proprietary information systems  results in greater efficiency for customers and increased customer satisfaction 
to complement our customer service  we seek to ease the administrative burdens on our customers by offering customized billing services  customer savings reports and other customized report features  electronic data interchange ordering  e commerce capabilities  bulk discounts and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by customers 
targeted direct mail marketing strategy 
our primary tools for marketing and product reference are the annual master catalogs used to showcase over  items 
in fiscal  our master catalogs were supplemented by specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures covering such specialty areas as cutting tools  measuring instruments  tooling components and maintenance and repair  industrial supply  and hose and tubing 
we use our database of approximately million companies with million individual contacts  and also purchase mailing lists of prospective customers  to target the distribution of these various publications to specific individuals within an organization whose purchasing history or other criteria suggest receptiveness to mailings of specific publication titles 
the use of specialty and promotional publications  which are produced in house  has resulted in increased productivity through lower costs  increased response rates and more efficient use of advertising space 
msc s publication circulation decreased from million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal this planned decrease in mailings is in line with our continuing strategy to increase the productivity of our direct marketing efforts and increase overall return on advertising dollars spent 
commitment to technological innovation 
we take advantage of technological innovations to support growth  improve customer service and to reduce our operating costs through more effective buying practices  automated inventory replenishment and efficient order fulfillment operations 
msc s proprietary software tracks all of the skus over  and enables the customer and the sales representatives to determine the availability of products in stock on a real time basis and to evaluate alternative products and pricing 
msc s website mscdirect 
com is a searchable on line catalog with electronic ordering capabilities designed to take advantage of the opportunities created by internet commerce 
the mscdirect 
com site offers a broad array of products  services  workflow management tools and related information to meet the needs of customers seeking to reduce process costs through internet e commerce enabled solutions 
our information systems have been designed to enhance inventory management and turnover  customer service and cost reduction for both msc and our customers 
in addition to internal and customer information systems  we continually upgrade our distribution methods and systems to improve productivity and efficiency 
we also provide a comprehensive edi ordering system to support our customer based purchase order processing 
we continue to invest in inventory management solutions with our recently introduced cmi program 
our customers can print barcode labels directly through mscdirect 
com and preset reorder quantities 
the customer monitors the inventory levels and replenishes any item simply by scanning the bar code 
the order is then electronically downloaded into a shopping cart on our website for the customer to review and submit  thereby enabling the customer to lower their overall procurement costs and maintain lower inventory levels 
growth strategy our objective is to become the preferred supplier of industrial products for companies throughout the united states 
we intend to increase sales to existing customers and diversify our customer base by expanding government and national account programs  expanding our direct sales force and increasing their productivity  increasing the number of product lines and skus offered including generic and imported products  targeting the circulation of the master catalog and our direct mail campaign  continually developing technological innovations employing modern technologies to reduce our customers costs and utilizing extensive e commerce capabilities  making it even easier and more appealing to do business with msc  expanding next day ground delivery into new markets  and maintaining excellent customer support service 
expand government and national account programs 
the company has developed internal government and national account programs to meet the specific needs of these types of customers 
we believe that significant growth opportunities exist within these segments and that they are an integral part of our customer diversification program 
this allocation of resources will allow the company to better support these customers  expand our customer acquisition activities and is a key component of our overall growth strategy 
increasing the size and improving the productivity of our direct sales force 
we believe that increasing the size of the sales force and improving sales force productivity can have a positive effect on our sales per customer 
the focus is to enable our sales force to spend more time with our customers and provide increased support during the mro purchasing process thereby capturing more of their mro spend 
increasing the number of product lines and skus 
we believe that continuing to increase the breadth of our product line and providing high levels of customer service are effective methods of increasing sales to current customers and attracting new customers 
by expanding the product lines and skus offered within existing product categories  we seek to satisfy an increasing percentage of the supplies purchases of our customers and to attract new customers 
to continue to provide a diverse product line and maintain profit margins in our competitive market place  the company has sought out vendors to supply higher margin generic and imported products 
in fiscal  we added approximately  skus  which is the net result of new sku additions reduced by deletions of older slow moving sku items  and currently have over  skus in total 
we generally add skus in response to the feedback we receive from our existing customers 
targeted circulation of our master catalog and direct mail campaign 
we have accumulated a buyer database of approximately million companies with million individual contacts  and industry expertise within specific markets 
we utilize empirical information from this database to prospect for new customers  thereby increasing the circulation of our master catalogs 
we supplement our master catalogs with direct mailings of specialty and promotional publications to further increase customer response and product purchases 
industry specific expertise is used to target customer growth areas and focus sales and marketing campaigns 
e commerce capabilities 
mscdirect 
com is a proprietary business to business horizontal marketplace serving the industrial market that offers customers full access to our catalog  and all orders placed online at mscdirect 
com are backed by our same day shipping guarantee 
mscdirect 
com utilizes the same highly trained sales force and support services as msc s traditional business  emphasizing msc s values of placing customers needs first 
it is available hours a day  seven days a week providing real time inventory availability  superior search capabilities  on line bill payment  delivery tracking status and a number of other enhancements including work flow management tools 
the user friendly search engine allows customers to order by description  vendor or brand 
we believe mscdirect 
com is a key component of our strategy to reduce customers mro transaction costs and internal requisition time 
the site also allows customers to control which of their staff are entitled to purchase products online  how much they are entitled to spend and which staff require secondary approval 
the process is fully automated and integrated into our back end systems 
most orders move directly from the customers desktop to the distribution center floor  removing human error  reducing handling costs and speeding up the transaction flow 
msc continues to evaluate our site and solicit customer feedback  making on going improvements targeted at allowing mscdirect 
com to remain one of the premier sites in its marketplace 
our mscdirect 
com marketing campaign continued in fiscal year to raise awareness and drive volume to the website 
mscdirect 
com generated revenue of more than million in fiscal year  a increase over the prior year 
e procurement solution providers sell a suite of e commerce products designed to meet the needs of businesses seeking reduced procurement costs and increased effectiveness of their mro direct materials process by using internet enabled solutions 
we have associations with many of these providers including  among others  ariba  perfect commerce  oracle  sap and i procure 
we continue to evaluate and expand our capabilities in these areas  when they can provide value for our customers 
expanding next day ground delivery 
our experience has been that sales in areas accessible by next day ground delivery are significantly greater than in areas with second day delivery 
accordingly  our long term goal is to expand our geographic coverage of next day ground delivery throughout the united states  which at some point in the future may require the expansion of existing facilities or the opening of new facilities 
maintain excellent customer support service 
our goal is to anticipate a customer s service needs 
we are continuing to proactively expand the services that we provide and respond and build programs at customer requests 
our one call does it all philosophy continues to be the cornerstone of our service model even as the complexity of the needs of our customers continues to grow 
this focus on our customers needs provide a market differentiator  which enables us to retain existing customers and grow our customer base 
products we currently offer over  skus  representing a broad range of mro including metal working product lines that include cutting tools  measuring instruments  tooling components  fasteners  flat stock  raw materials  abrasives  machinery hand and power tools  safety  janitorial  plumbing  material handling  power transmission  electrical supplies as well as other categories 
we attribute a portion of our sales growth to the total number of skus offered  which helps our customers reduce the number of suppliers they use to meet their mro needs 
in this regard  we intend to continue to add new products to our existing product categories 
our offering of specific products from multiple manufacturers at different prices and quality levels permits us to offer a good better best product selection alternative 
this alternative provides similar product offerings with varying degrees of name recognition  quality and price enabling the customer to choose the appropriate product for a specific task on the most cost effective basis 
msc seeks to distinguish itself from its competition through offering both name brand and generic products and significant depth in its core product lines while maintaining competitive pricing 
our in bound sales representatives and technical support personnel are trained to assist customers in making intelligent cost saving purchases 
we believe this approach results in significant amounts of repeat business and is an integral part of our strategy to reduce our customers industrial supply costs 
we purchase substantially all of our products directly from approximately  suppliers 
we are not materially dependent on any one supplier or small group of suppliers 
no one single supplier accounted for more than of our total purchases in fiscal generic products are manufactured by third parties to our specifications 
distribution centers a significant number of our products are carried in stock  and approximately of sales are fulfilled from the distribution centers or branch offices 
certain products  such as specialty or custom items and some very large orders  are shipped directly from the manufacturer 
our distribution centers are managed via computer based sku tracking systems and radio frequency devices that facilitate the location of specific stock items to make the picking process more efficient 
we have invested significant resources in technology and automation to increase efficiency and reduce costs  and continually monitor our order fulfillment process 
we currently utilize four distribution centers for product shipment located near harrisburg  pennsylvania  atlanta  georgia  elkhart  indiana and reno  nevada 
sales and marketing our customers include a broad range of purchasers of industrial supply products  from one man machine shops  to fortune companies  to government agencies including the usps 
our core business focuses on selling relatively higher margin  lower volume products and has an average order size of approximately in fiscal we market to small  medium and large companies in a wide range of sectors  including but not limited to durable and non durable goods manufacturing which accounted for of the company s revenue in fiscal  education  government and health care 
we also have government and national account programs designed to address the needs of these customers 
one focus area for our sales force is the execution of new contracts with both the general services administration gsa and the usps 
we believe that expanding our business with government agencies will assist us to better manage periodic downturns in the manufacturing industry 
these national relationships are for mro products and are well matched to msc s product breadth and depth 
gsa customers include military bases  veteran s hospitals  federal correctional facilities  army corps of engineers facilities  etc 
the usps contract connects msc to over  postal facilities nation wide  including bulk mail centers  processing centers  vehicle maintenance facilities  post offices and more 
we also plan to continue our successful strategy of growing national account sales through the acquisition of new accounts and the penetration of existing accounts 
the msc value proposition is consistent with the procurement strategies of large  fortune corporations as they attempt to reduce their supply base by partnering with companies that can serve their needs nationally and drive costs out of their supply chain by using msc s e procurement  vmi and cmi inventory solutions 
by adding national accounts we are able to diversify into new customer segments  strengthen our mro product lines and acquire the scale that helps the company achieve our purchasing goals 
we have identified hundreds of additional national account prospects and have given our sales team tools to ensure we are targeting and implementing programs with the companies that best fit the msc model 
one of our subsidiaries also offers wholesalers and other distributors the ability to create their own customized mail order catalog  by offering turnkey marketing programs and promotional mailers 
any resulting orders are serviced directly by msc  which stocks and ships the products under the customer s program 
another division of msc offers a line of lower priced products to the budget oriented customer 
we have in excess of  combined active customers companies which have purchased at least once during the past months 
typically  a customer s industrial supply purchases are managed by several buyers responsible for different categories of products 
we target these individual buyers within an organization and distribute publications corresponding to the product categories for which such buyers are responsible 
we are able to implement this direct marketing strategy because of the depth of customer information contained in our information systems databases 
our customers select desired products from our various publications and place their orders by telephone  facsimile  internet or direct computer link 
we have invested significant resources in developing an extensive customer and prospect database 
this database is a key component of our growth strategy 
the customer and prospect database includes detailed information  including company size  number of employees  industry  various demographic and geographic characteristics and personal purchase histories catalog preference  product preference  order value 
we believe that the variety and depth of information on our customers and prospects offers us a significant competitive advantage in increasing sales to existing customers and attracting new customers 
we rely on in bound sales representatives at our call centers  distribution centers and branch offices  who are responsible for substantially all customer contacts and order entries 
these sales representatives are highly trained individuals who build relationships with customers  assist customers in reducing costs  provide technical support  coordinate special orders and shipments with vendors and update customer account profiles in our information systems databases 
our one call does it all philosophy is predicated on the ability of the sales representative  utilizing our information systems comprehensive databases as a resource  to respond effectively to the customer s needs 
when a customer places a call to msc  the sales representative taking the call has immediate access to that customer s company and specific buyer profile  as well as inventory levels by distribution center on all of skus offered by msc 
the customer s profile includes historical and current billing information  historical purchasing information and plant and industry information 
msc s in bound sales representatives at our call centers undergo an intensive two week training course  are required to attend regular on site training seminars and workshops  and are monitored and evaluated at regular intervals 
additionally  the sales representatives are divided into teams that are evaluated monthly and monitored on a daily basis by team supervisors 
sales representatives receive technical training regarding various products from vendors and in house training specialists 
we also maintain a separate technical support group dedicated to answering specific customer inquiries and assisting customers with the operation of products and finding low cost solutions to manufacturing problems 
our direct sales representatives work out of the branches and generate a significant portion of our sales 
they are responsible for increasing sales per customer and servicing existing customers 
the sales representatives accomplish this by taking our product offering  distribution capabilities  customer service models and value added programs directly to the customer 
these associates are the touch point to the customer and provide the organization feedback on competitive landscape  purchasing trends and help to drive process and service improvement in order for msc to retain and increase our market position 
branch offices we currently operate approximately branch offices located in states 
we have experienced higher sales growth and market penetration in areas where we have established a branch office and believe our branch offices are important to the success of our business strategy of obtaining and penetrating new and existing accounts 
publications our primary reference tool is our annual  page master catalog  which is supported by specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures 
we use specialty and promotional publications to target customers in specific areas  such as metal fabrication  facilities management  safety and janitorial 
we distribute specialty and promotional catalogs and brochures based on information in our databases and purchased mailing lists to customers whose purchasing history or profile suggests that they are most likely to purchase according to specific product categories or product promotions 
consequently  specialty catalogs offer a more focused selection of products at a lower catalog production cost and more efficient use of advertising space 
msc s in house marketing staff designs and produces all of our catalogs  brochures and newspapers 
each publication is printed with photographs  contains detailed product descriptions and includes a toll free telephone number and website address to be used by customers to place a product order 
in house production helps reduce overall expense and shortens production time  allowing us the flexibility to alter our product offerings and pricing and refine our catalog  brochure more quickly 
the number of pieces mailed has decreased from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal the decrease in circulation and number of publications are a result of our ongoing strategy to increase direct mail productivity and increase overall return on advertising dollars spent 
fiscal year ended august  weeks august  weeks august  weeks number of publication titles number of publications mailed customer service one of our goals is to make purchasing our products as convenient as possible 
since a majority of customer orders are placed by telephone  the efficient handling of calls is an extremely important aspect of our business 
order entry and fulfillment occurs at each of our branches and main call centers located at our four distribution centers 
calls are received by customer service phone representatives who utilize on line terminals to enter customer orders into computerized order processing systems 
our telephone ordering system is flexible and  in the event of a local or regional breakdown  can be re routed to alternative locations 
when an order is entered into the system  a credit check is performed  and  if the credit is approved  the order is electronically transmitted to the distribution center closest to the customer and a packing slip is printed for order fulfillment 
we believe that our relationships with all our carriers are satisfactory 
we guarantee same day shipping of in stock products if the order is received prior to regional cut off times and most customers receive their orders other than custom items and large industrial items shipped directly by the manufacturer within one or two business days of the order date 
customers are invoiced for merchandise  shipping and handling promptly after shipment 
information systems our proprietary information systems allow centralized management of key functions  including communication links between distribution centers  inventory and accounts receivable management  purchasing  pricing  sales and distribution  and the preparation of daily operating control reports that provide concise and timely information regarding key aspects of our business 
these proprietary information systems enable us to ship to customers on a same day basis  respond quickly to order changes  provide a high level of customer service  achieve cost savings  deliver superior customer service and manage our operations centrally 
our proprietary information systems are also a key component of our e commerce capabilities 
most of our information systems operate over a wide area network and are real time information systems that allow each distribution center and branch office to share information and monitor daily progress relating to sales activity  credit approval  inventory levels  stock balancing  vendor returns  order fulfillment and other measures of performance 
we maintain a sophisticated buying and inventory management system that monitors substantially all of our skus and automatically purchases inventory from vendors for replenishment based on projected customer ordering models 
we also maintain an electronic data interchange edi purchasing program with our vendors with the objective of allowing us to place orders more efficiently  reduce order cycle processing time  and increase the accuracy of orders placed 
in addition to developing the proprietary computer software programs for use in the customer service and distribution operations  we also provide a comprehensive edi ordering system to support our customer based purchase order processing 
in addition  we have developed a windows based cd rom electronic catalog package and we provide product information and ordering capabilities on the internet 
msc also supports a proprietary hardware and software platform in support of its vmi initiative allows customers to integrate scanner accumulated orders directly into our sales order entry system 
in  we introduced our new cmi program  which allows our customers to simply and effectively bar code their own inventory  scan  and submit orders directly to our internet site 
in we have also expanded both our vmi and cmi capabilities to function directly as front end ordering systems for our e portal based customers 
we run our systems on an ibm iseries platform and utilize disaster recovery techniques and procedures  which we believe are adequate to fulfill our needs and are consistent with this type of equipment 
we believe that planned enhancements and upgrades to the next generation of our existing operating platforms will be sufficient to sustain our present operations and our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future 
competition the mro supply industry is a large  fragmented industry that is highly competitive 
we face competition from traditional channels of distribution such as retail outlets  small dealerships  regional or national distributors utilizing direct sales forces  manufacturers of mro supplies  large warehouse stores and larger direct mail distributors 
we believe that sales of mro supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years  which may make the industry more competitive 
our competitors challenge us with a greater variety of product offerings  financial resources  services or a combination of all of these factors 
in the industrial products market  customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on one or more of the following criteria price  product selection  product availability  level of service and convenience 
we believe we compete effectively on all such criteria 
seasonality we generally experience slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months our fourth fiscal quarter as a result of our industrial customers plant shutdowns during this period 
associates as of august   we employed  associates  including  full time and part time associates 
no associate is represented by a labor union 
we consider our relationships with associates to be good and have experienced no work stoppages 
available information we file annual  quarterly and current reports  information statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
the public may read and copy any materials we file with the sec at the sec s public reference room at fifth street  nw  washington  nw the public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the sec at sec the sec also maintains an internet site that contains reports  proxy and information statements  and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec

we make available on or through our investor relations page on our web site  free of charge  our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and beneficial ownership reports on forms   and and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after this material is electronically filed or furnished to the sec 
we also make available  on our website the charters of the committees of our board of directors and management s code of ethics  the code of business conduct and corporate governance guidelines pursuant to sec requirements and new york stock exchange listing standards 
risk factors in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be considered in evaluating the company and its business 
our future operating results depend upon many factors and are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the known material risks and uncertainties which may cause our operating results to vary from anticipated results or which may negatively affect our operating results and profitability are as follows changes in our customer and product mix could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate 
from time to time  since our formation  we have experienced changes in our customer mix and in our product mix 
changes in our customer mix have resulted from geographic expansion  daily selling activities within current geographic markets  and targeted selling activities to new customer segments 
changes in our product mix have resulted from marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers 
as our national accounts and government program sales grow  the company will face continued pressures on maintaining gross margin because these customers receive lower pricing due to their higher sales volumes 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our historical gross margins 
the company plans to continue its efforts to buy better in order to maintain current margin levels 
although we have been successful in incrementally increasing our gross margin percentage by varying our customer and product mix over the last several years and our strategy has emphasized higher margin  lower volume orders  changes in our customer and product mix  including increased sales to national account and government programs  could cause our gross margin percentage to fluctuate or decline from time to time in the future 
our industry is consolidating which could cause it to become more competitive 
the business of selling mro supplies in north america is currently undergoing some consolidation 
this consolidation is being driven by customer needs and supplier capabilities  which could cause the industry to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by suppliers 
traditional mro suppliers are attempting to consolidate the market through internal expansion  through acquisition or merger with other industrial and construction suppliers  or through a combination of both 
this consolidation allows suppliers to improve efficiency and spread fixed costs over a greater number of sales  and to achieve other benefits derived from economies of scale 
customers are increasingly aware of the total costs of fulfillment  and of their need to have consistent sources of supply at multiple locations 
consistent sources of supply provide not just reliable product quantities  but also consistent pricing  quality  services and engineering capabilities 
we believe these customer needs could result in fewer suppliers as the industry consolidates  and as the remaining suppliers become larger and capable of being a consistent source of supply 
the trend of our industry toward consolidation could make it more difficult for us to maintain our operating margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of the trend or that we can do so effectively 
in addition  as various sectors of the industrial and construction customer base face increased foreign competition  and in fact lose business to foreign competitors or shift their operations overseas in an effort to reduce expenses  we may face increased difficulty in growing and maintaining our market share and growth prospects 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the mro supply industry  although consolidating  still remains a large  fragmented industry that is highly competitive 
we face competition from traditional channels of distribution such as retail outlets  small dealerships  regional or national distributors utilizing direct sales forces  manufacturers of mro supplies  large warehouse stores and larger direct mail distributors 
we believe that sales of mro supplies will become more concentrated over the next few years  which may make the industry more competitive 
our competitors challenge us with a greater variety of product offerings  financial resources  services or a combination of all of these factors 
although we have recently had success in diversifying our customer base  which we believe will assist us to better manage periodic downturns in the manufacturing industry  there can be no assurance that sales to these additional customers will offset the adverse effects of other competitive trends in our industry  including those discussed above 
the risk of cancellation or rescheduling of orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the cancellation or rescheduling of orders may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers  there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers business needs or purchasing budgets 
additionally  although our customer base is diverse  ranging from one person machine shops to fortune companies and large government agencies  the cancellation or rescheduling of significant orders by larger customers may still have a material adverse effect on our operating results from time to time 
work stoppages and other disruptions at transportation centers or shipping ports may adversely affect our ability to obtain inventory and make deliveries to our customers 
our ability to provide same day shipping of our core business products is an integral component of our overall business strategy 
disruptions at transportation centers or shipping ports  such as the severe winter weather experienced during the third quarter of fiscal and the longshoreman s strike on the west coast in fiscal  affect both our ability to maintain core products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations 
the risks of war  terrorism  and similar hostilities may adversely affect our operating results 
in addition to having an impact on general economic conditions  events such as the attacks of september  and the recent conflict in iraq may adversely affect our revenues and our ability to service our customers 
we believe that both the events of september  and the iraq conflict had an adverse effect on our results of operations  although the impact of such events can be difficult to quantify 
disruptions of our information systems could adversely affect us 
we believe that our computer software programs are an integral part of our business and growth strategies 
we depend upon our information systems to help process orders  to manage inventory and accounts receivable collections  to purchase  sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis  to maintain cost effective operations  and to help provide superior service to our customers 
any disruption in the operation of our information systems  including widespread power outages such as those that affected the northeastern and midwest united states in august  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we utilize disaster recovery techniques and procedures  which we believe are adequate to fulfill our needs  and we believe that planned enhancements and upgrades to the next generation of our existing operating platforms will be sufficient to sustain our present operations and our anticipated growth for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that disruptions of our information systems will not occur 
our success is dependent on certain key personnel 
our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of certain key senior management 
the loss of the services of one or more of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we do not maintain any key man insurance policies with respect to any of our executive officers 
distribution center expansions in the future  as part of our long term strategic planning  we may open new distribution centers to improve our efficiency  geographic distribution and market penetration 
moving or opening distribution centers requires a substantial capital investment  including expenditures for real estate and construction  and a substantial investment in inventory 
in addition  new distribution centers will have an adverse impact on distribution expenses as a percentage of sales  inventory turnover and return on investment in the periods prior to and for some time following the commencement of operations of each new distribution center 
additionally  until sales volumes mature at new distribution centers  operating expenses as a percentage of sales may be adversely impacted 
further  substantial or unanticipated delays in the commencement of operations at new distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on our geographic expansion and may impact results of operations 
availability of and integration of prospective acquisitions acquisitions have played a limited role in our recent growth 
from time to time in the future  we may pursue selected acquisitions that either expand or complement our business in new or existing markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and to acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on terms favorable to us and in a timely manner 
the failure to complete or successfully integrate prospective acquisitions may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy 
we are not currently a party to any oral or written acquisition agreement or engaged in any negotiations with respect to any material acquisition candidate 
our common stock price may be volatile 
we believe factors such as fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors  changes in economic conditions in the market sectors in which our customers operate notably the durable and non durable goods manufacturing industry  which accounted for of our revenue in fiscal  and changes in general market conditions  could cause the market price of our class a common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our class a common stock 
our principal shareholders exercise significant control over us 
our chief executive officer  his sister  certain of their family members and related trusts collectively own of the outstanding shares of class b common stock 
consequently  such shareholders will be in a position to elect all of the directors of the company and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of the company s shareholders for approval 
shares eligible for future sale sales of a substantial number of shares of class a common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the class a common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of its equity securities 
as of august  there were  shares of class a common stock outstanding 
in addition   options to purchase shares of class a common stock granted under the company s   and stock option plans remain outstanding 
options to purchase an additional  shares of class a common stock may be granted under the company s stock option plan 
an additional  shares may be granted under the restricted stock plan  and approximately  shares may be sold through the company s associate stock purchase plan 
our class b common stock is convertible  on a one for one basis  into our class a common stock at any time 
as of august   there were  shares of class b common stock outstanding 
all of the shares of class b common stock and the shares of class a common stock into which such shares are convertible are restricted securities for purposes of the securities act 
subject to the volume and other limitations set forth in rule promulgated under the securities act  all of such restricted securities are eligible for public sale

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general our objective is to become the preferred supplier of industrial products for companies throughout the united states 
we intend to increase sales to existing customers and diversify our customer base by expanding government and national account programs  expanding our direct sales force and increasing their productivity  increasing the number of product lines and skus offered including generic and imported products  targeting the circulation of our master catalog and our direct mail campaign  continually developing technological innovations employing modern technologies to reduce our customers costs and utilizing extensive e commerce capabilities  making it even easier and more appealing to do business with msc  expanding next day ground delivery into new markets  and maintaining excellent customer support service 
in the future  we intend to take advantage of the additional products offered and our expanded distribution capabilities through our direct marketing efforts and by increasing the size of our sales force  however  the costs associated with the sales force expansion and our direct marketing program will be incurred in advance of increased sales and may negatively impact operating margins in the short term 
historically  the company has been able to acquire new customers and increase sales to existing customers through its direct marketing program  although there is no guarantee that this will continue in the future 
our fiscal year can be summarized as one of solid financial performance 
we achieved record net sales  gross profit  net income and net income per common share basic and diluted 
the company has been able to take advantage of the strengthening us economy as well as execute on its growth strategies to increase revenues during the company was successful in gaining market share in the national account and government program sectors  which have become important components of our overall customer mix  revenue base  recent growth and planned business expansion 
by expanding in these sectors  which involve customers with a large number of multiple locations and high volume mro needs  we have diversified our customer base beyond small and medium sized customers  thereby reducing the cyclical nature of our business 
we have also maintained our commitment to drive cost reduction throughout the business 
by holding gross profit margins steady  and realizing operating leverage from prior investments in our infrastructure we have been able to increase operating margins to of net sales  an improvement of as compared to fiscal the end result is that the company has been able to convert a million net sales increase into a million increase in net income during fiscal as part of our focus to lower costs throughout the business and increase the productivity of our direct marketing efforts  we have reduced our mailing levels over the last two fiscal years and reduction in fiscal and fiscal  respectively and expect to keep current mailing levels constant in fiscal the company continues to focus on discontinuing mailings to our smaller accounts that have made limited purchases over the last months 
in the past we would send mailings to these accounts and found that based on the net returns realized from these accounts this was not the most effective use of our advertising budget 
we are seeing the benefits of our reduction in mailings strategy as our sales per piece has grown each quarter of this fiscal year 
as expected  we did see some of these customers drop off our active customer count due to the decreased mailings  but these customers did not present significant future growth potential 
the institute for supply management ism index  which measures the economic activity of the us manufacturing sector  is important to our planning because it historically has been an indicator of our manufacturing customers activity approximately of our revenues come from sales in the manufacturing sector  including some national account customers 
the ism has come down from its peak during the year of for the month of may to for the month of october we believe that this is still a strong level and historically ism levels in the mid range or higher have been a good predictor of future sales growth for the company 
it is possible that the impact of rising energy prices and interest rates and raw material availability will have an adverse effect on customer order flow 
we believe that companies will be seeking cost reductions and shorter cycle times from their suppliers 
our business model focuses on providing an overall procurement cost reduction and just in time delivery to meet our customers needs 
to meet our customers needs and our business goals  we will seek to continue to drive cost reduction throughout our business through cost saving strategies and increased leverage from our existing infrastructure  and continue to provide additional procurement cost savings solutions to our customers through technology such as with our cmi and vmi programs 
results of operations the following table shows selected items of msc s consolidated statement of operations  percentages of sales and comparisons between the fiscal years ended august  and august  fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  fiscal year ended august  of sales august  of sales increase in dollars increase in percent net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses income from operations other income interest income  net other income  net total other income income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income net sales increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of an increase in sales to existing customers and the growth of our national accounts and government programs 
the primary reasons for the increase in sales to existing customers is a combination of the success of our sales force to penetrate the accounts as well as the strengthening of the us economy during fiscal these factors were the primary reason for the increase in average order size to approximately in fiscal from approximately in fiscal and the increase in average sales per customer to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal our national account and government programs sales initiative was successful in fiscal and contributed strongly to the company s total sales growth and the diversification of our customer mix and revenue base 
we delivered solid results as the growth in these sectors met our expectations and we expect this to continue into these large customers tend to require advanced e commerce capabilities 
we feel that our ability to transact with our customers through various portals and directly through our website  mscdirect 
com  give us a competitive advantage over smaller suppliers 
sales through mscdirect 
com increased to million in fiscal  an increase of approximately over fiscal as our national account and government programs continue to grow we will benefit from processing more sales through electronic transactions that carry lower operating costs than manual entries entered through our call centers and branches 
these cost savings may be offset by the lower margins on national accounts and government business 
we introduced approximately  new skus in fiscal and removed approximately  skus from our product lines 
we believe the new skus improve the overall quality of our offering and were important factors in our sales growth 
also  we increased our sales force approximately to associates at august  as part of our strategy to acquire new accounts and penetrate existing accounts across all customer types 
overall  net sales in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal grew adjusted for differences in number of days in prior year quarters  due to timing of holidays at   and  respectively as compared to the same quarters in fiscal manufacturing and non manufacturing sector sales grew and  respectively during fiscal as compared to fiscal sales 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased slightly from to 
increased efforts to buy better by employing competitive reverse auctions  the benefits of volume buying from our vendors  and expanding our selection of higher margin imported private label and generic products coupled with the strengthening us economy has enabled the company to maintain its gross margin 
as our national account and government programs sales grow  the company will face continued pressures on maintaining this gross margin because these customers receive lower pricing due to their higher sales volumes 
the company plans to continue its efforts to buy better in order to maintain current margin levels 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses in dollars was primarily the result of an increase in freight expense to support increased sales and an increase in payroll and payroll related costs offset by a decrease in  depreciation and advertising expenses 
payroll and payroll related costs continue to make up a significant portion of our operating expenses 
these costs increased in fiscal as a result of annual payroll increases as well as an increase in head count offset by lower medical costs related to the company s self insured medical plan 
the decrease in medical costs during fiscal is a result of an improvement in the company s loss experience as well as implementation of cost saving strategies such as a small increase to plan deductibles and a small increase to co payment amounts 
as we continue to increase our sales force during fiscal as part of our growth strategy to build sales we expect to see continued increases in payroll and payroll related costs 
advertising expense has decreased during fiscal primarily due to a planned reduction of the fiscal mailing levels 
this is a result of our strategy to increase the sales per piece mailed by discontinuing mailings to customers who have had few purchases from the company in the last months 
the company plans to maintain our current level of publications for fiscal as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses decreased from to  primarily as the result of productivity gains and the allocation of fixed expenses over a larger revenue base 
income from operations increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the gross profit  offset in part by the increase in operating expenses as described above 
interest income  net increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net interest income is a result of an increase in cash and investments during fiscal provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate was approximately and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of increased state taxes during fiscal net income 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and diluted earnings per share increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the factors  which affected net income and diluted earnings per share  have been discussed above

gross profit increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased from to 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was the result of modest price increases  vendor rebates  continued favorable product mix  favorable discounts obtained from vendors and the success of the company s efforts to increase gross profit margins with new and existing customers 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses in dollars was primarily the result of an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses due to annual salary increases  increased medical and other benefit related costs offset by a decrease in the number of associates and an increase in freight expense as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by a decrease in advertising expense primarily due to a planned reduction in the number of publications mailed

net income 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the factors which affected net income have been discussed above 
diluted earnings per share increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this is the result of the increase in net income in fiscal and a decrease in the diluted weighted average shares primarily due to the repurchase of the company s outstanding class a stock which is now reflected as treasury stock 
quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth unaudited financial data for each of msc s last eight fiscal quarters 
year ended august  year ended august  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in thousands unaudited consolidated income statement data net sales gross profit income from operations net income net income per share basic diluted we have generally experienced slightly lower sales volumes during the summer months  and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
as a result  net income in the fourth fiscal quarter is historically somewhat lower than in the third fiscal quarter  due largely to the continuation of our fixed costs during slower sales periods 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital needs have been to fund the working capital requirements necessitated by our sales growth  adding new products  and facilities expansions 
our primary source of financing has been cash generated from operations 
taken as a whole  cash  cash equivalents and all available for sale securities increased by approximately million to million at august  from million at august  the company allowed its former credit facility to expire on october  under the credit facility  the maximum permitted borrowings were million under an unsecured revolving credit agreement

the company expects borrowings to bear interest at the banks base prime rate in effect at august  or  at the company s option  above the reserve adjusted libor rates for loans with interest periods of thirty  sixty or ninety days 
there are no covenants associated with this line of credit and no funds have been drawn down to date 
we anticipate cash flows from operations  available cash resources and available lines of credit will be adequate to support our operations for the next months 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended august  and august  was million and million  respectively 
the decrease of approximately million in net cash provided from operations resulted primarily from a million investment in inventory and accounts receivable less accounts payable and accrued liabilities  offset by higher net income and income tax benefits related to stock option exercises 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal years ended august  and august  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in usage of cash in fiscal was primarily a result of the company s decision to invest approximately of its cash equivalents primarily in tax advantaged available for sale securities during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million and net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended august  was million 
the cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted primarily from the proceeds from exercise of class a common stock options offset by the quarterly cash dividend paid to shareholders and purchases of class a treasury stock

actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies described below are impacted by the company s critical accounting estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and collateral is generally not required 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on numerous factors  including past transaction history with customers and their credit worthiness 
the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience and adjusts it for changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable as well as specifically identified customers that are having difficulty meeting their financial obligations eg bankruptcy  eg due to the overall improvement in the accounts receivable aging  primarily the result of the strengthening us economy  the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased slightly in even though sales increased during fiscal historically there has not been significant volatility in our bad debt expense due to strict adherence to our credit policy 
inventory valuation reserve inventories consist of merchandise held for resale and are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments to reduce inventory to net realizable value on a quarterly basis 
the reserve is initially provided for based on a percentage of sales 
each quarter items to be liquidated are specifically identified and written down  using historical data and reasonable assumptions  to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
sales returns the company establishes a reserve for anticipated sales returns based on historical return rates 
the return rates are periodically analyzed for changes in current return trends 
historically  material adjustments to the estimated sales reserve have not been required based on actual returns

with the current inflation in medical costs  the ibnr reserve may increase 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company allowed its former credit facility to expire on october  under the credit facility  the maximum permitted borrowings were million under an unsecured revolving credit agreement 
as of august  the company had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement and was in compliance with all financial covenants 
the company has obtained an uncommitted million line of credit  up to million of this amount can be used for letters of credit  with a large financial institution the lender 
the company can draw funds on this line subject to future due diligence and negotiation with the lender 
borrowings will bear interest at rates mutually agreed to when a borrowing request is made 
the company expects borrowings to bear interest at the banks base prime rate in effect at august  or  at the company s option  above the reserve adjusted libor rates for loans with interest periods of thirty  sixty or ninety days 
there are no covenants associated with this line of credit and no funds have been drawn down to date 
the company also has a long term note payable in the amount of approximately million to the pennsylvania industrial development authority which is secured by the land on which the harrisburg  pennsylvania distribution center is located  which bears interest at per annum and is payable in monthly installments of approximately  includes principal and interest through september the company maintains an investment portfolio of municipal notes and bonds and corporate bonds of varying maturities 
these securities  which are held for purposes other than trading  are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
approximately of the investments are comprised of variable interest rate debt securities that reset to market prevailing rates at various intervals  thus limiting the exposure to fair value fluctuations for changes in interest rates 
the remaining of the investment portfolio is comprised of fixed interest rate debt securities 
for the fixed interest rate debt securities  a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair value of these securities  whereas  a decrease in interest rates could have a favorable impact on the fair value of these securities 
to estimate the impact of a potential change in interest rates on the valuation of the fixed rate debt securities held at august   a modeling technique was used that assumes that market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points 
based on this modeling technique  an increase in interest rates of basis points would reduce the estimated valuation of these securities by approximately conversely  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would increase the estimated valuation by approximately unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  that are considered to be temporary  are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of any related tax effect 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in interest income 
the cost of securities sold is based on the first in  first out method 
in addition  the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash equivalents and investments in available for sale securities
