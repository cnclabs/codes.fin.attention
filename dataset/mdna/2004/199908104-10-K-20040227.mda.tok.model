item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
also see forward looking statements discussion 
introduction and overview we are a national provider of comprehensive heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac installation  maintenance  repair and replacement services within the mechanical services industry 
the services we provide address a very broad need  as air is circulated through almost all commercial  industrial and institutional buildings virtually year round 
we operate primarily in the commercial  industrial and institutional hvac markets and perform most of our services within office buildings  retail centers  apartment complexes  manufacturing plants  and healthcare  education and government facilities 
in addition to standard hvac services  we provide specialized applications such as building automation control systems  fire protection  process cooling  electronic monitoring and process piping 
certain locations also perform related activities such as electrical service and plumbing 
nature and economics of our business approximately of our revenues are earned on a project basis for installation of hvac systems in newly constructed facilities or for replacement of hvac systems in existing facilities 
customers hire us to ensure such systems deliver specified or generally expected heating  cooling  conditioning and circulation of air in a facility 
this entails installing core system equipment such as packaged heating and air conditioning units  or in the case of larger facilities  separate core components such as chillers  boilers  air handlers  and cooling towers 
we also typically install connecting and distribution elements such as piping and ducting 
our responsibilities usually require conforming the systems to pre established engineering drawings and equipment and performance specifications  which we frequently participate in establishing 
our project management responsibilities include staging equipment and materials to project sites  deploying labor to perform the work  and coordinating with other service providers on the project  including any subcontractors we might use to deliver our portion of the work 
when competing for project business  we usually estimate the costs we will incur on a project  then propose a bid to the customer covering price and other performance and payment terms 
our bid price and terms are intended to cover our estimated costs on the project and provide a profit margin to us commensurate with the value of the installed system to the customer  the risk that project costs or duration will vary from estimate  the schedule on which we will be paid  the opportunities for other work that we might forego by committing capacity to this project  and other costs that we incur more broadly to support our operations but which are not specific to the project 
typically customers will seek bids from competitors for a given project 
while the criteria on which customers select the winning bid vary widely and include factors such as quality  technical expertise  on time performance  post project support and service  and company history and financial strength  we believe that price is the most influential factor for most customers in choosing an hvac installation and service provider 
after a customer accepts our bid  we generally enter into a contract with the customer that specifies what we will deliver on the project  what our related responsibilities are  and how much and when we will be paid 
our overall price for the project is typically set at a fixed amount in the contract  although changes in project specifications or work conditions that result in unexpected additional work are usually subject to additional payment from the customer via what are commonly known as change orders 
project contracts typically provide for periodic billings to the customer as we meet progress milestones or incur cost on the project 
project contracts in our industry also frequently allow for a small portion of progress billings or contract price to be withheld by the customer until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
labor and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service 
accordingly  labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance 
given the fixed price nature of much of our project work  if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders  we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work 
we also perform some project work on a cost plus or a time and materials basis  under which we are paid our costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit margin 
these margins are typically less than fixed price contract margins because there is less risk of unrecoverable cost overruns in cost plus or time and materials work 
as of december   we had  projects in process 
our average project takes three to six months to complete  with an average contract price of approximately  our projects generally require working capital funding of equipment and labor costs 
customer payments on periodic billings generally do not recover this investment until late in the job 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms as discussed above generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
because of the integral nature of hvac and related controls systems to most buildings  we have the legal right in almost all cases to attach liens to buildings or related funding sources when we have not been fully paid for installing systems  except with respect to some government buildings 
the service work that we do  which is discussed further below  usually does not give rise to lien rights 
we also perform larger hvac projects 
as of december   we had one project in process with a contract price of between and million  four projects between million and million  ten projects between million and million  and projects between million and million 
taken together  projects with contract prices of million or more totaled million of aggregate contract value as of december   out of a total contract value for all projects in progress of million 
generally  projects closer in size to million will be completed in a year or less 
it is unusual for us to work on a project that exceeds two years in length 
in addition to project work  we also provide maintenance and repair service on already installed hvac and controls systems 
this kind of work usually takes from a few hours to a few days to perform 
prices to the customer are usually based on the equipment and materials used in the service as well as technician labor time 
we usually bill the customer for service work when it is complete  typically with payment terms of up to thirty days 
we also provide maintenance and repair service under ongoing contracts 
under these contracts  we are paid regular monthly or quarterly amounts and provide specified service based on customer requirements 
these agreements typically cover periods ranging from one to three years and are cancelable on to days notice 
a relatively small but growing portion of our revenues comes from national and regional account customers 
these customers typically have multiple sites  and contract with us to perform maintenance and repair service 
these contracts may also provide for us to perform new or replacement systems installation 
we operate a national call center to dispatch technicians to sites requiring service 
we will also typically use proprietary information systems to maintain information on the customer s sites and equipment  including performance and service records  and related cost data 
these systems track the status of ongoing service and installation work  and may also monitor system performance data 
under these contractual relationships  we usually provide consolidated billing and credit payment terms to the customer 
profile and management of our operations our company was originally formed in through an initial public offering  or ipo  and simultaneous acquisition of companies engaged in our business 
from the time we completed our ipo through december  we acquired hvac and complementary businesses  of which were tuck in operations that were integrated upon acquisition with existing operations 
since we suspended our acquisition program in late  we have sold or ceased operations at companies through we have consolidated another companies into other operations  such that today we have operating units 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we shifted our strategy from an emphasis on acquisition based growth to a focus on improving the performance of our existing operations 
significantly  on march   we sold operations to emcor group  inc for million  including emcor s assumption of approximately million of subordinated notes to former owners of certain of the divested companies 
these operations provided million of our revenue in we used the proceeds from this sale to reduce debt 
the operating results of companies sold to emcor have been reported under discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we recognized a loss of million and a goodwill impairment charge prior to the sale of million  net of taxes  related to the sold operations 
for a further discussion of this sale  see item financial statements and supplemental data notes and we manage our operations based on a variety of factors 
financial measures we emphasize include profitability  and use of capital as indicated by cash flow and by other measures of working capital principally involving project cost  billings and receivables 
we also monitor selling  general  administrative and indirect project support expense  backlog  workforce size and mix  growth in revenues and profits  variation of actual project cost from original estimate  and overall financial performance in comparison to budget and updated forecasts 
operational factors we emphasize include project selection  estimating  pricing  management and execution practices  labor utilization  safety  training  and the make up of both existing backlog as well as the business being pursued  in terms of project size  technical application and facility type  end use customers and industries  and location of the work 
most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis 
attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business  particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation  the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants such as architects and consulting engineers  and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets 
accordingly  we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality  stability  and contingency planning  including related considerations of compensation  and non competition protection where applicable 
economic and industry factors as an hvac and building controls services provider  we operate in the broader nonresidential construction services industry and are affected by trends in this sector 
while we do not have operations in all major cities of the us  we believe our national presence is sufficiently large that we experience trends in demand for and pricing of our services that are consistent with trends in the national nonresidential construction sector 
as a result  we monitor the views of major construction sector forecasters along with macroeconomic factors they believe drive the sector  including trends in gross domestic product  interest rates  business investment  employment  demographics  and the general fiscal condition of federal  state and local governments 
although nonresidential construction activity has demonstrated periods of both significant growth and decline  it has grown at a compound annual rate of approximately over the last two decades 
spending decisions for building construction  renovation and system replacement are generally made on a project basis  usually with some degree of discretion as to when and if projects proceed 
with larger amounts of capital  time  and discretion involved  spending decisions are affected to a greater degree by uncertainty  particularly concerns about macroeconomic and geopolitical trends 
we have experienced periods of time  such as after the terrorist incidents on september  in the us  and prior to and during the war in iraq that occurred in early  when uncertainty caused a significant slowdown in decisions to proceed with installation or replacement project work 
most of the hvac equipment we install is provided by four large manufacturers 
we regularly seek the views of these manufacturers about trends in the commercial hvac sector 
we also evaluate hvac equipment shipment statistics reported monthly by the air conditioning and refrigeration institute  which is the principal industry organization of hvac equipment manufacturers 
we believe that many owners of installed hvac equipment have deferred maintenance and replacement activity during the very challenging economic conditions of the last several years 
we also believe that this trend will not continue indefinitely due to the fundamental operating needs of the equipment 
the large hvac manufacturers have each made public statements supporting this view 
however  there can be no assurance of whether or when we might actually experience increased demand for hvac service and replacement 
operating environment and management emphasis nonresidential building construction and renovation activity  as reported by the federal government  has declined over the last three years in response to the broader us recession as well as uncertainty relating to international events 
this has been a more extended period of contraction than the sector has experienced in other recent recessions  with particularly steep declines in the commercial and industrial portions of the industry 
as a result  like most nonresidential hvac service providers  we have experienced decreasing volume  prices  and therefore gross profits during this period 
we have responded to these market challenges by pursuing work in sectors less affected by this downturn  such as government  educational  and health care facilities  and by establishing marketing initiatives that take advantage of our size and range of expertise 
these initiatives include our regional and national multi location service efforts  our energy efficiency capabilities  and collaboration among our operating units to seek joint project opportunities 
as a result of these responses  the decreases we have seen in revenues over the last three years have been less than the overall decline in activity experienced by the broader nonresidential sector 
we also responded to declining gross profits over recent years by reducing our selling  general  and administrative expenses  and our indirect project and service overhead costs 
we believe our efforts in these areas have partially offset the decline in our profitability over this period 
in addition to addressing revenues and costs more broadly  we also evaluate our operations on a by unit and by market basis 
a number of our units have experienced significantly lower results at various points over the last three years  including ten units that incurred operating losses in while the difficult market conditions over this period of time certainly influenced the performance of these units  we also experienced operational execution shortfalls that contributed to lower results 
the majority of such underperforming operations have been closed  sold  merged with stronger operations  or reduced in size or operating scope 
we also replaced management at most ongoing operations in this group 
we currently have operating units 
while it would be unusual in a group of this size to have no underperforming units even in better market conditions  we expect to have fewer units with significantly decreased operating results or losses in than we had in with the difficult market conditions in our industry over recent years along with the integration challenges we encountered following our substantial acquisition growth of the late s  we also operated in an environment of relatively tight credit restrictions from our lenders 
in addition  we have had to more actively manage our relationships with the surety market  through which we procure payment and performance bonds required for approximately of our work 
accordingly  cash flow and debt reduction have been particularly high priorities for us over this period of time 
as a result of our sale of certain operations to emcor in early as well as our continued strong emphasis on cash flow  our debt outstanding  net of cash  as of yearend was virtually zero 
at the end of  we put a new credit facility in place with considerably less restrictive and more traditional terms than those of our previous facilities 
further  our surety relationships  while generally strong in the past  have improved 
we have generated positive free cash flow in twelve of the last fifteen quarters  and will continue our emphasis in this area 
however  we expect that we will have to devote noticeably fewer management and organizational resources to debt and capital structure matters in than we have in recent years 
as discussed at greater length in results of operations below  we see some signs of increased activity levels in our industry in we expect price competition to continue to be strong  as local and regional competitors respond cautiously to changing conditions 
we will continue our efforts to find the more active sectors in our markets  and to increase our regional and national account business 
however  our primary emphasis for will be on internal execution and margin improvement  rather than on revenue growth 
in addition to the work we have done on our underperforming units as described above  we have increased our focus on project qualification  estimating  pricing and management  and on service performance 
this focus includes significant increases in unit level training 
based on indications of stabilizing industry conditions and on our emphasis on internal execution and margin improvement  we expect that our results will be significantly better than our results 
over the longer term  if industry conditions are stable to improving  we believe we will experience more periods of increased revenues 
in addition  while we would not rule out growth by acquisition  particularly in view of how fragmented our industry is  we have no current acquisition plans  and believe it is likely that any acquisitions we might consider during would be relatively modest 
critical accounting policies in response to the securities and exchange commission s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we identified our critical accounting policies based upon the significance of the accounting policy to our overall financial statement presentation  as well as the complexity of the accounting policy and our use of estimates and subjective assessments 
we have concluded that our most critical accounting policy is our revenue recognition policy 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  our business has two service functions i installation  which we account for under the percentage of completion method  and ii maintenance  repair and replacement  which we account for as the services are performed  or in the case of replacement  under the percentage of completion method 
in addition  we identified other critical accounting policies related to our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the recording of our self insurance liabilities  valuation of deferred tax assets and the assessment of goodwill impairment 
these accounting policies  as well as others  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
percentage of completion method of accounting approximately of our revenues were earned on a project basis and recognized through the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method as provided by american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  contract revenue recognizable at any time during the life of a contract is determined by multiplying expected total contract revenue by the percentage of contract costs incurred at any time to total estimated contract costs 
more specifically  as part of the negotiation and bidding process in which we engage in connection with obtaining installation contracts  we estimate our contract costs  which include all direct materials net of estimated rebates  labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation costs 
then  as we perform under those contracts  we measure such costs incurred  compare them to total estimated costs to complete the contract  and recognize a corresponding proportion of contract revenue 
this measurement and comparison process requires updates to the estimate of total costs to complete the contract  and these updates may include subjective assessments 
our contracts typically provide for a schedule of billings or invoices to the customer based on reaching agreed upon milestones or as we incur costs  although the billing schedule usually does not precisely match the schedule on which we incur costs 
as a result  contract revenues recognized in the statement of operations can and usually do differ from amounts that can be billed or invoiced to the customer at any point during the contract 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is also affected by changes in job performance  job conditions  and final contract settlements 
these factors may result in revisions to estimated costs and  therefore  revenues 
such revisions are frequently based on further estimates and subjective assessments 
we recognize these revisions in the period in which they are determined 
if such revisions lead us to conclude that we will recognize a loss on a contract  the full amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the period we reach that conclusion  regardless of the percentage of completion of the contract 
revisions to project costs and conditions can give rise to change orders under which the customer agrees to pay additional contract price 
revisions can also result in claims we might make against the customer to recover project variances that have not been satisfactorily addressed through change orders with the customer 
we do not recognize revenues or margin based on change orders or claims until they have been agreed upon with the customer  with immaterial exceptions 
variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results  depending on project size  and the recoverability of the variation via additional customer payments 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable 
inherent in the assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts are certain judgments and estimates including  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  our prior collection history with the customer  the ongoing relationships with the customer  the aging of past due balances  our lien rights  if any  in the property where we performed the work  and the availability  if any  of payment bonds applicable to our contract 
these estimates are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
accounting for self insurance liabilities we are substantially self insured for worker s compensation  employer s liability  auto liability  general liability and employee group health claims in view of the relatively high per incident deductibles we absorb under our insurance arrangements for these risks 
losses up to deductible amounts are estimated and accrued based upon known facts  historical trends and industry averages 
a third party actuary reviews these estimates annually 
we believe such accruals to be adequate 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  timely reporting of occurrences  ongoing treatment or loss mitigation  general trends in litigation recovery outcomes and the effectiveness of safety and risk management programs 
therefore  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities  adjustments may be required and would be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known 
accounting for deferred tax assets we regularly evaluate valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
we perform this evaluation at least annually at the end of each fiscal year 
the estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the activity underlying these assets becomes deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if actual future taxable income differs from our estimates  we may not realize deferred tax assets to the extent we have estimated 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in most businesses we have acquired  the value we paid to buy the business was greater than the value of specifically identifiable net assets in the business 
under generally accepted accounting principles  this excess is termed goodwill and is recognized as an asset at the time the business is acquired 
it is generally expected that future net earnings from an acquired business will exceed the goodwill asset recognized at the time the business is bought 
under previous generally accepted accounting principles  goodwill was required to be amortized  or regularly charged to our operating results in our statement of operations 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  went into effect in we adopted it as of january  this new standard has two effects 
first  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill against our operating results 
second  we are required to regularly test the goodwill on our books to determine whether its value has been impaired  and if it has  to immediately write off  as a component of operating income  the amount of the goodwill that is impaired 
more specifically  we are required to assess our goodwill asset amounts for impairment each year  and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred 
the new requirements for assessing whether goodwill assets have been impaired involve market based information 
this information  and its use in assessing goodwill  entails some degree of subjective assessment 
as part of the adoption of sfas no 
 we were required to make a one time determination of any transitional impairment loss by applying the standard s new  more rigorous valuation methodology 
the result of this transitional analysis was a million charge  net of tax benefit  reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our statement of operations in the first quarter of additional impairment charges of million and million were recorded in operating results during the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
the impairment charge during primarily resulted from changes in operating plans that were identified in the fourth quarter for certain of our reporting units as part of our annual budgeting and business planning process 
results of operations in thousands table historical results year ended december  revenues    cost of services    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses   goodwill amortization and impairment   restructuring charges   operating income    interest expense  net    other income expense  write off of debt costs and discount  net income loss before income taxes    income tax expense benefit    income loss from continuing operations   discontinued operations operating results  net of tax  estimated loss on disposition  including tax  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss    table supplemental disclosure operating income of ongoing operations excluding certain items the following table presents operating income excluding operations we have sold or shut down that did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations under generally accepted accounting principles in our historical income statement 
this table also excludes from operating income a restructuring charges  b amounts relating to the resolution of our receivables with kmart in connection with that company s bankruptcy  and c goodwill impairment charges in and  and goodwill amortization for prior to the change in accounting rules that eliminated regular goodwill amortization 
we have included this table because we believe it offers an additional view of the core results of our ongoing operations in a way we find useful in managing these operations  and in a way which also responds to frequent questions we receive about the company from third parties 
however  this presentation of operating income is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and should not be considered an alternative to operating income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles and presented above in table historical results 
in particular  while this table excludes restructuring charges  we have recorded them in each of the last three years 
in addition  impairment charges under the recently changed goodwill accounting rules are generally expected to occur periodically as goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition of businesses responds over time to changes in those businesses markets and operations 
year ended december  revenues    divested units not reflected in discontinued operations  revenues from ongoing operations   cost of services divested units not reflected in discontinued operations  cost of services from ongoing operations   gross profit from ongoing operations selling  general and administrative expenses divested units not reflected in discontinued operations  kmart reserves and settlement  selling  general and administrative expenses from ongoing operations  excluding kmart items    operating income from ongoing operations  excluding kmart items  goodwill amortization and impairment and restructuring charges  compared to revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in compared to the decline in revenue was comprised of a increase in revenue at ongoing operations and a decline in revenue related to operations that were sold during the modest increase in year to date revenues at ongoing operations in resulted primarily from a continuation of mixed economic conditions in numerous markets 
these conditions originated with the general economic slowdown in the us which began in this slowdown led to deferral of both new and replacement project activity  and has also resulted in a more competitive pricing environment 
activity levels in our industry worsened in late and early based on renewed uncertainty about the economy and international events 
we have seen some stabilization in the second half of as revenue at ongoing operations showed small year over year increases in the third and fourth quarters 
we have seen some signs that activity levels in our industry may increase over the next year as compared to current levels 
these observations are based on nonresidential construction spending trends  shipment data from hvac equipment manufacturers  and anecdotal indications of renewed project consideration 
in addition  we and other industry participants believe that there has been a general deferral of maintenance and replacement activity in the installed base of commercial  industrial  and institutional hvac equipment  in response to the more difficult economy 
we and other industry participants believe this trend will not continue indefinitely due to the fundamental operating needs of the equipment  but it is not clear when maintenance and replacement activity might increase 
while we believe these trends and expectations are positive  there can be no assurance that industry activity levels will actually increase over the coming year 
in view of the challenging economic environment and price competition affecting our industry  we may continue to experience only modest revenue growth or revenue declines in upcoming periods 
in addition  if general economic activity in the us slows significantly from current levels  we may realize further decreases in revenue and lower operating margins 
backlog primarily contains installation and replacement project work  and maintenance agreements 
these projects generally last less than a year 
service work and short duration projects are generally billed as performed and therefore do not flow through backlog 
accordingly  backlog represents only a portion of our revenues for any given future period  and it represents revenues that are likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months 
as a result  we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term  and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters 
backlog associated with continuing operations as of december  was million  a decrease from december  backlog of million 
backlog has increased modestly in january and early february from yearend levels 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  historical gross profit decreased from in to in  and posted a similar decline in ongoing operations 
the decline in gross profit in as compared to is primarily due to lower industry activity levels  increased price competition  and moderate execution shortfalls in five of our operations  offset to a lesser degree by improved efficiency at three of our operations 
two of the operations with shortfalls this year are being combined with other units 
the other three are more established operations at which such shortfalls are expected to be temporary 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased from in to in during the second quarter of  we reversed million of the bad debt reserves that were established in the fourth quarter of related to our receivables with kmart as a result of a bankruptcy related settlement with kmart 
accordingly  the decrease in normal sg a from to was greater by this amount 
the decrease in sg a resulted from the following a the sale or closure of certain units that did not qualify for discontinued operations presentation  b the substantial downsizing in the first quarter of of our marketing initiative emphasizing energy efficiency  c decreased outlays for medical costs  and d a concerted effort to reduce sg a throughout our company 
goodwill amortization and impairment we no longer amortize goodwill via regular charges to our income statement due to our adoption of sfas see cumulative effect of change in accounting principle below for further discussion 
additional goodwill impairment charges of million and million were recorded during the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
the impairment charge in primarily resulted from changes in operating plans that were identified for certain of our reporting units in the fourth quarter as part of our annual budgeting and business planning process 
restructuring charges during the first three quarters of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million pre tax 
these charges included approximately million for severance costs and retention bonuses primarily associated with the curtailment of our energy efficiency marketing activities  a reorganization of our national accounts operations as well as a reduction in corporate personnel 
the severance costs and retention bonuses related to the termination of employees  all of whom had left the company by december  the restructuring charges for this period also included approximately million for remaining lease obligations and million of other costs recorded in connection with the actions described above 
during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
these charges included approximately million for severance costs primarily associated with the reduction in corporate office overhead in light of our smaller size following the emcor transaction described below under discontinued operations 
the severance costs related to the termination of employees  all of whom had left the company by march  these restructuring charges also included approximately million for costs associated with decisions to merge or close three smaller divisions and realign regional operating management 
interest expense  net interest expense  net  decreased million to million in this decline resulted from lower average borrowing levels and market interest rates in  offset to a lesser degree by increased letter of credit fees and mark to market adjustments associated with a warrant and put that were issued in connection with the original establishment of the credit facility we had in effect in interest expense for and included the following primary elements in thousands interest expense on borrowings and unused commitment fees  letter of credit fees a amortization of deferred debt arrangement costs   mark to market adjustments on derivatives interest income total   a in  letter of credit amounts outstanding and related fees were significantly lower 
these fees were treated as an element of bank service charges in selling  general and administrative expenses during this period 
other income expense other expense was million for  and other income was million for first quarter includes a loss of million on the disposition of a division of one of our operations 
other income for includes a gain of million on the sale of the residential portion of one of our operations in the second quarter of  and a gain of million related to the extinguishment of subordinated debt in the fourth quarter of write off of debt costs and discount  net in the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash write off of million of deferred debt arrangement costs and discount when we terminated our previous credit facility 
these amounts were partially offset by a million gain associated with the reduction in the value of a warrant and put obligation that arose when the facility terminated in the fourth quarter was originally established 
this reduction in the value of the warrant and put obligation resulted from a significant restriction in the holder s ability to exercise the put provision 
this restriction was agreed to by the holder in connection with terminating the related facility 
we also reflected a non cash charge of million in the first quarter of for deferred debt costs that were associated with previously higher levels of capacity under this credit facility 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash write off of million of debt costs when we terminated a preceding credit facility 
the first quarter of includes a non cash writedown of million of debt costs in connection with the reduction in our borrowing capacity following the emcor transaction 
the following table recaps these writeoffs in thousands write off of deferred financing fees and transaction costs  write off of discount originally arising from issue of warrant and put to credit facility lender  reduction in valuation of warrant and put obligation  total  income tax expense benefit our effective tax rates associated with results from continuing operations for and were and  respectively 
our effective rates in and in the first three quarters of were higher than statutory rates because of the effect of certain expenses that we incur that are not deductible for tax purposes  and due to reserves that we have established against certain deferred tax assets based on the possibility that we will not be able to ultimately realize the tax benefit for certain losses we have incurred  primarily at the state income tax level 
in addition  since our recent pre tax profit margins have been relatively low on a historical and an absolute basis  the impact of non deductible expenses on our effective rate is magnified 
in the fourth quarter of  our year to date pre tax income from continuing operations turned negative as we recognized significant charges for the write off of deferred debt arrangement costs and for goodwill impairment 
the effective benefit rate on our full year pre tax loss further increased over statutory rates to as a result of additional tax adjustments in the fourth quarter 
these adjustments included benefit for the reversal of tax contingency reserves no longer deemed necessary as a result of an updated review of our tax positions across the jurisdictions in which we do business  offset to a lesser degree by additional reserves against state level deferred tax assets that may be not fully realized  and recognition of the effect of the nondeductible portion of the goodwill impairment we recorded in the fourth quarter 
we currently expect our effective rate to be in the mid range 
discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  we sold a small operating company 
this unit s after tax income of million and million for and  respectively  has been reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax 
as a result of the sale of this unit  we recorded a loss of million  net of tax benefit  in discontinued operations under estimated loss on disposition  including tax 
the loss resulted from the non cash write off of nondeductible goodwill 
during the third quarter of  we committed to a plan to divest of a small operating company 
this unit s after tax income of million in and million for the first three quarters of has been reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax 
as a result of the decision in the third quarter of to sell this unit  we recorded an estimated loss of million  including taxes  related to this planned disposition in estimated loss on disposition  including tax based upon an estimated sales price 
the final loss as measured at the closing of this sale in the fourth quarter of was not materially different than the estimate recorded in the preceding quarter 
the estimated loss resulted from the non cash write off of nondeductible goodwill 
during the second quarter of  we sold a small operating company 
this unit s after tax income of million for each of and the first six months of has been reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax 
as a result of the decision in the first quarter of to sell this unit  we recorded an estimated loss in the first quarter of of million  including taxes  related to this transaction in estimated loss on disposition  including tax 
the final loss as measured at the closing of this sale in the second quarter of was not materially different than the estimate recorded in the preceding quarter 
the loss resulted from the non cash write off of nondeductible goodwill 
on march   we sold operations to emcor group 
the total purchase price was million  including the assumption by emcor of approximately million of subordinated notes to former owners of certain of the divested companies 
the transaction with emcor provided for a post closing adjustment based on a final accounting  done after the closing of the transaction  of the net assets of the operations that were sold to emcor 
that accounting indicated that the net assets transferred to emcor were approximately million greater than a target amount that had been agreed to with emcor 
in the second quarter of  emcor paid us that amount  and released million that had been escrowed in connection with this element of the transaction 
of emcor s purchase price  million was deposited into an escrow account to secure potential obligations on our part to indemnify emcor for future claims and contingencies arising from events and circumstances prior to closing  all as specified in the transaction documents 
of this escrow  million has been applied in determining the company s liability to emcor in connection with the settlement of certain claims as described subsequently in this section 
the remaining million of escrow is available for book purposes to apply to any future claims and contingencies in connection with this transaction  and has not been recognized as part of the emcor transaction purchase price 
the net cash proceeds of approximately million received to date from the emcor transaction were used to reduce our debt 
we paid million of taxes related to this transaction in march in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a charge of million  net of tax benefit of million  in discontinued operations under estimated loss on disposition  including tax in connection with the emcor transaction 
this charge primarily related to a settlement with emcor for reimbursement of impaired assets and additional liabilities associated with the operations acquired from us 
under this settlement  we were released from liability on all other outstanding receivables and issues relating to the profitability of projects that were in process at the time emcor acquired these operations from us 
during may  we paid million in cash to emcor associated with this settlement 
the settlement agreement also includes the use of million of the million escrow described above to fund settled claims 
we further recognized an additional million of the remaining escrow applicable to elements of the settlement still to be funded  of which million was paid from escrow in september accordingly  for book purposes  million of escrow remains available to apply against future claims that may arise from emcor in connection with this transaction 
we recorded a tax benefit of million related to this additional charge 
in addition  the million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of is also net of a tax credit of million as a result of lower final tax liabilities in connection with the overall emcor transaction than we estimated when the transaction originally closed in the first quarter of under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which took effect for us on january   the operating results of the companies sold to emcor for all periods presented through the sale  as well as the loss on the sale of these operations  have been presented under discontinued operations 
we realized an aggregate loss of million  including related tax expense  in connection with the sale of these operations 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we also recognized a goodwill impairment charge related to these operations of million  net of tax benefit  as of january  the reporting of our aggregate initial goodwill impairment charge in connection with adopting sfas no 
is discussed further below under cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in march  we decided to divest of a small operating company 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an estimated loss of million  net of tax benefit  from this planned disposition in discontinued operations under estimated loss on disposition  including tax 
in the fourth quarter of  we reversed this estimated loss because we decided not to sell this unit 
during the second quarter of  we sold a division of one of our operations 
the after tax loss for this division for the first two quarters of of million has been reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax 
we realized a loss of million  net of tax benefit  on the sale of this division 
this loss was included in discontinued operations under estimated loss on disposition  including tax during the second quarter of cumulative effect of change in accounting principle sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required a transitional assessment of our goodwill assets went into effect in we adopted it as of january  to perform the transitional impairment testing required by sfas no 
under its new  more rigorous impairment criteria  we broke our operations into reporting units  as prescribed by the new standard  and tested each of these reporting units for impairment by comparing the unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model combined with market valuation approaches 
significant estimates and assumptions were used in assessing the fair value of reporting units 
these estimates and assumptions involved future cash flows  growth rates  discount rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market valuations for each of the reporting units 
as provided by sfas no 
 the transitional impairment loss identified by applying the standard s new  more rigorous valuation methodology upon initial adoption of the standard was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our results of operations 
the resulting non cash charge was million  net of tax benefit  and was recorded during the first quarter of outlook as noted above  we have reported lower earnings in than in we have experienced reduced activity levels and increased price competition stemming from the general economic slowdown which began in and which worsened in late and early based on renewed uncertainty about the economy and international events 
in addition  we had adverse cost developments in certain projects in two of our operations early in the current year 
further  we realized operating losses at a number of our units as a result of poor execution and challenging market conditions 
in the third quarter of  our revenues at ongoing operations increased as compared to  and operating income and margin  excluding restructuring charges  were essentially unchanged 
in the fourth quarter of  revenues at ongoing operations increased as compared to operating income excluding restructuring charges and goodwill impairment increased over a difficult fourth quarter of  while operating margin determined on the same basis increased from in to in these are the first favorable year over year increases we have posted in some time  as we have continued to contend with difficult industry and economic conditions 
while there can be no assurance of similar increases in  they contribute to our expectation  as discussed further below  that we will produce improved operating results in as compared to as noted earlier in this review  while we see signs that industry activity levels may increase in  our primary emphasis for the upcoming year is on margin improvement rather than revenue growth 
margin indications in backlog as of yearend reflected slightly higher levels than at recent quarterends 
in addition  our ongoing margin improvement efforts include a focus on reducing the number of our units with significantly decreased operating results or losses in as compared to  and intensified project and service performance training at the unit level 
based on these efforts and on our expectation that industry and economic conditions will improve in  we believe that our results will be significantly better than our results  although there can be no assurance that we will achieve this outcome 
compared to revenues revenues decreased million  or  to million in compared to the decline in revenues was comprised of a decline in revenues at ongoing operations and a decline in revenues related to operations that were sold or shut down during the decline in revenues at ongoing operations in resulted primarily from the effect of the general economic slowdown that began in this slowdown led to widespread delays in facility owners decisions to proceed on both new and replacement projects  and also resulted in a more competitive pricing environment 
the decline in revenue was also consistent with management s decreased emphasis on revenue growth in favor of improvement in profit margins  operating efficiency  and cash flow 
backlog primarily contains installation and replacement project work  and maintenance agreements 
these projects generally last less than a year 
service work and short duration projects are generally billed as performed and therefore do not flow through backlog 
accordingly  backlog represents only a portion of our revenues for any given future period  and it represents revenues that are likely to be reflected in our operating results over the next six to twelve months 
as a result  we believe the predictive value of backlog information is limited to indications of general revenue direction over the near term  and should not be interpreted as indicative of ongoing revenue performance over several quarters 
backlog associated with continuing operations as of december  was million  an increase from december  backlog of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we removed million from backlog that related to a project that we concluded was not going to proceed 
this project was first reflected in backlog in the third quarter of if this project is excluded from all applicable periods  our backlog reflected an increase of from an adjusted december  backlog of million 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased from in to in  and posted a similar decline in ongoing operations 
the decline in gross profit for the year as a whole was primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment as a result of the general economic slowdown which began in this slowdown also resulted in project delays at a number of our operations as decisions to start new construction activities as well as retrofit projects were delayed in the fourth quarter of these delays significantly affected our revenue volume and profitability during the first part of in the fourth quarter of  we experienced cost overruns in certain operations as well as reduced activity levels in connection with renewed uncertainty about the economy and international events 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased million  or  to million in compared to as a percentage of revenues  sg a decreased from in to in during the fourth quarter of  we estimated and recorded bad debt expense of approximately million related to our receivables with kmart  in light of that company s bankruptcy filing in january during the second quarter of  we reversed million of the bad debt reserves that were established in the fourth quarter of related to the kmart receivables as a result of a settlement with kmart 
excluding the kmart charge in and reversal in  as well as the effects of operations we have sold that did not quality for separate classification as discontinued operations  sg a declined million  or  to million  and as a percentage of revenue  from in to in the decrease in sg a was primarily due to a concerted effort to reduce sg a throughout our company 
this effort included a reduction in corporate overhead at the end of the first quarter of in response to our smaller size following the sale of units to emcor as discussed further below under discontinued operations 
costs associated with this particular reduction were reflected as restructuring charges in march sg a as a percentage of revenues for periods prior to the emcor transaction is also higher because the financial statements do not allocate any corporate overhead to the discontinued operations 
as a result  sg a for continuing operations in those periods includes substantially the full amount of corporate office overhead that was in place to support our larger size prior to the sale of operations to emcor 
goodwill amortization and impairment as discussed above  we no longer amortize goodwill via regular charges to our income statement due to our adoption of sfas see cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for further discussion 
we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of restructuring charges during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
these charges included approximately million for severance costs primarily associated with the reduction in corporate office overhead in light of our smaller size following the emcor transaction 
the severance costs related to the termination of employees  all of whom had left the company by march  the restructuring charges for the quarter also included approximately million for costs associated with decisions to merge or close three smaller divisions and realign regional operating management 
during the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  primarily related to contractual severance obligations of two operating presidents in connection with our significant restructuring program in the second half of these restructuring charges were net of a gain of approximately million related to our decision to sell a small operation during the first quarter of interest expense  net interest expense  net  decreased million to million in a portion of our actual interest expense in both years has been allocated to the discontinued operations caption based upon our net investment in these operations 
therefore  interest expense relating to continuing operations does not reflect the pro forma reduction of interest expense from applying the proceeds from the sale of these operations to reduce debt in any earlier period 
interest expense allocated to the discontinued operations in and was million and million  respectively 
other income expense other income was million for and million for other income for the second quarter of includes a gain of million on the sale of the residential portion of one of our operations 
in addition  a gain of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the extinguishment of subordinated debt 
write off of debt costs and discount  net the fourth quarter of includes a non cash write off of million of deferred financing costs resulting from the replacement of our previous credit facility 
the first quarter of includes a non cash writedown of million of loan arrangement costs in connection with the reduction in our borrowing capacity following the emcor transaction 
income tax expense benefit our effective tax rates associated with results from continuing operations for and were and  respectively 
as a result of the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
effective january   our effective tax rate no longer reflects a permanent difference between book income and tax income for goodwill amortization that is not deductible for tax purposes 
discontinued operations on march   we sold operations to emcor group 
the total purchase price was million  including the assumption by emcor of approximately million of subordinated notes to former owners of certain of the divested companies 
the transaction with emcor provided for a post closing adjustment based on a final accounting  done after the closing of the transaction  of the net assets of the operations that were sold to emcor 
that accounting indicated that the net assets transferred to emcor were approximately million greater than a target amount that had been agreed to with emcor 
in the second quarter of  emcor paid us that amount  and released million that had been escrowed in connection with this element of the transaction 
of emcor s purchase price  million was deposited into an escrow account to secure potential obligations on our part to indemnify emcor for future claims and contingencies arising from events and circumstances prior to closing  all as specified in the transaction documents

the remaining million of escrow is available for book purposes to apply to any future claims and contingencies in connection with this transaction  and has not been recognized as part of the emcor transaction purchase price 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a charge of million  net of tax benefit of million  in discontinued operations under estimated loss on disposition  including tax in connection with the emcor transaction 
this charge primarily related to a settlement with emcor for reimbursement of impaired assets and additional liabilities associated with the operations acquired from us 
under this settlement  we were released from liability on all other outstanding receivables and issues relating to the profitability of projects that were in process at the time emcor acquired these operations from us 
the settlement agreement also included the use of million of the million escrow described above to fund settled claims 
we further recognized an additional million of the remaining escrow applicable to elements of the settlement still to be funded 
accordingly  for book purposes  million of escrow remains available to apply against future claims that may arise from emcor in connection with this transaction 
we recorded a tax benefit of million related to this additional charge 
in addition  the million charge recognized during the fourth quarter is also net of a tax credit of million as a result of lower final tax liabilities in connection with the overall emcor transaction than we estimated when the transaction originally closed in the first quarter of under sfas no

we realized a total loss of million  including related tax expense  in connection with the sale of these operations 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we also recognized a goodwill impairment charge related to these operations of million  net of taxes  as of january  the reporting of our aggregate initial goodwill impairment charge in connection with adopting sfas no

in march  we also decided to divest of an additional operating company

in the fourth quarter of  we reversed this estimated loss because we decided not to sell this unit 
during the second quarter of  we sold a division of one of our operations 
the after tax loss for this division for the first two quarters of of million has been reported in discontinued operations under operating results  net of tax in our results of operations 
we realized a loss of million  net of tax benefit  on the sale of this division 
this loss is included in estimated loss on disposition  including tax during the second quarter of in our results of operations 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required a transitional assessment of our goodwill assets 
to perform the transitional impairment testing required by sfas no 
under its new  more rigorous impairment criteria  we broke our operations into reporting units  as prescribed by the new standard  and tested each of these reporting units for impairment by comparing the unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using a discounted cash flow model combined with market valuation approaches 
significant estimates and assumptions were used in assessing the fair value of reporting units 
these estimates and assumptions involved future cash flows  growth rates  discount rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market valuations for each of the reporting units 
as provided by sfas no 
 the transitional impairment loss identified by applying the standard s new  more rigorous valuation methodology upon initial adoption of the standard was reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our results of operations 
the resulting non cash charge was million  net of tax benefit  and was recorded during the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    free cash flow cash provided by operating activities    taxes paid related to the sale of businesses  purchases of property and equipment    proceeds from sales of property and equipment   free cash flow    cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities excluding items related to sales of businesses  less customary capital expenditures  plus the proceeds from asset sales 
positive free cash flow represents funds available to invest in significant operating initiatives  to acquire other companies or to reduce a company s outstanding debt or equity 
if free cash flow is negative  additional debt or equity is generally required to fund the outflow of cash 
free cash flow may be defined differently by other companies 
our business does not require significant amounts of investment in long term fixed assets 
the substantial majority of the capital used in our business is working capital that funds our costs of labor and installed equipment deployed in project work until our customers pay us 
customary terms in our industry allow customers to withhold a small portion of the contract price until after we have completed the work  typically for six months 
amounts withheld under this practice are known as retention or retainage 
our average project duration together with typical retention terms generally allow us to complete the realization of revenue and earnings in cash within one year 
accordingly  we believe free cash flow  by encompassing both profit margins and the use of working capital over our approximately one year working capital cycle  is an effective measure of operating effectiveness and efficiency 
we have included free cash flow information here for this reason  and because we are often asked about it by third parties evaluating the company 
however  free cash flow is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles to be a primary measure of an entity s financial results  and accordingly free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to operating income  net income  or amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles 
for the year ended december   we had free cash flow of million as compared to million in this increase resulted primarily from using about million less in working capital to support our operations in as compared to when we increased our working capital investment by million 
during the first quarter of  free cash flow as well as borrowings from our credit facility were used to pay final tax payments of million associated with the sale of the operations to emcor 
the net proceeds received at the closing of the emcor transaction in the first quarter of were all used to reduce debt 
credit facility on december   we entered into a million senior credit facility the facility provided by a syndicate of four banks 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the capital stock of all our current and future subsidiaries and substantially all of their assets 
amounts due under the facility are also guaranteed by our current and future subsidiaries 
the facility consists of two parts a term loan and a revolving credit facility 
the term loan under the facility the term loan is million  which the company borrowed upon the closing of the facility 
the term loan must be repaid in quarterly installments over five years 
the facility requires prepayments of the term loan in certain circumstances 
proceeds in excess of million from the sale of an asset  or from a related series of asset sales  must be used to pay down the term loan 
asset sale proceeds of less than million must also be used to pay down the term loan unless they are reinvested in long term assets within six months of being received 
all principal payments under the term loan permanently reduce the original million capacity under this portion of the facility 
the facility also includes a three year million revolving credit facility the revolving loan available for borrowings or letters of credit 
letters of credit are discussed at greater length below under other commitments 
the facility requires that borrowings outstanding under the revolving loan must be less than million for ten consecutive business days at least once during each year 
we have already satisfied this condition for our borrowings and letters of credit outstanding under the facility at each monthend must be less than a borrowing base measured as of the same monthend 
the borrowing base is defined under the facility as of the following total trade receivables  less allowances for doubtful accounts  less receivables related to projects that are subject to payment or performance bonds 
the borrowing base as of december  was million 
we expect that our borrowing base will continue to exceed the million stated limit of the facility by significant amounts 
our borrowing and letter of credit capacity under the revolving loan portion of the facility at any given time is million less borrowings and letters of credit outstanding  subject to the borrowing base described above 
the facility contains financial covenants defining various financial measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply  as discussed further below 
covenant compliance is measured as of each quarterend 
while the facility s financial covenants do not specifically govern capacity under the facility  if our debt level under the facility at a quarterend covenant compliance measurement date caused us to violate the facility s debt to ebitda covenant described in more detail below our borrowing capacity under the facility could be restricted by the lenders 
accordingly  available capacity amounts shown below are presented both on a financial covenant basis and on a facility face value basis 
as of dec 
 as of feb 
 in thousands amounts outstanding revolving loan  term loan   other debt total debt   letters of credit available capacity unused revolving loan and letter of credit capacity based on revolving loan face value of million   unused revolving loan and letter of credit capacity based on quarterend debt to ebitda covenant  n a the facility contains financial covenants defining various financial measures and the levels of these measures with which we must comply 
covenant compliance is assessed as of each quarterend 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is defined under the facility for financial covenant purposes as net earnings for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date  plus the corresponding amounts for a interest expense  b income taxes  c depreciation and amortization  and d other non cash charges 
the facility also stipulates that ebitda for the first three quarters of was million for the first quarter  million for the second quarter  and million for the third quarter 
the facility s principal financial covenants include debt service coverage ratio the facility requires that the ratio of ebitda to the sum of interest expense and scheduled principal payments be at least 
interest expense is defined under the facility for purposes of this covenant as interest expense for the four quarters ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date  excluding corresponding twelve month amounts for a amortization of deferred debt arrangement costs  and b mark to market interest expense 
scheduled principal payments for this ratio are also measured for the twelve months ending as of any given quarterly covenant compliance measurement date 
the facility provides  however  that during the first three quarters of interest expense and scheduled principal payments used in this ratio will be the annualized amounts of actual year to date interest expense and scheduled principal payments  instead of actual amounts for these items for the twelve months then ended 
the company s debt service coverage ratio as of december  as measured under this covenant was 
tangible net worth the facility requires that our tangible net worth not be less than the sum of a million  b of net income earned beginning october   and c the net proceeds of any equity transactions 
for purposes of this ratio  the facility defines tangible net worth as stockholders equity less the book value of the following intangible assets goodwill  patents  copyrights  licenses  franchises  trade names  trade secrets  and operating leases 
the facility also provides that for purposes of this ratio  net income excludes any goodwill impairment charges 
the company s tangible net worth as of december  as measured under this covenant was million  as compared to a covenant requirement of million 
debt to ebitda the facility requires that our ratio of debt to ebitda not exceed our debt to ebitda ratio as of december  as measured under this covenant was capital expenditures the facility limits capital expenditures to million per year 
our capital expenditures during were million 
other restrictions the facility prohibits payment of dividends and repurchase of shares by the company  and limits non facility debt  capital lease obligations  acquisitions  investments  and sales of assets 
the facility also includes a customary provision under which the lenders may demand immediate repayment of borrowings and disposition of letters of credit if they conclude that our business or financial position has suffered a material adverse change 
however  the facility does not include any mechanisms allowing the lenders immediate access to our ongoing cash flow in the event of a default or an immediate repayment demand by the lenders 
in view of our financial position  and what we believe are our prospects for profitability and positive cash flow in the future  we believe that the probability that our lenders will invoke the material adverse change provision of the facility in the foreseeable future is remote 
as a result  debt under the facility is classified as long term  other than amounts due within one year 
off balance sheet arrangements and other commitments as is common in our industry  we have entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
our most significant off balance sheet transactions include liabilities associated with noncancelable operating leases 
we also have other off balance sheet obligations involving letters of credit and surety guarantees 
we enter into noncancelable operating leases for many of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
certain of our vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on our behalf  such as to beneficiaries under our self funded insurance programs 
we have also occasionally used letters of credit to guarantee performance under our contracts and to ensure payment to our subcontractors and vendors under those contracts 
the letters of credit we provide are actually issued by our lenders through our credit facility as described above 
a letter of credit commits the lenders to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to perform specified actions 
if this were to occur  we would be required to reimburse the lenders 
depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement  we may also have to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement 
absent a claim  there is no payment or reserving of funds by the company in connection with a letter of credit 
however  because a claim on a letter of credit would require immediate reimbursement by us to our lenders  letters of credit are treated as a use of credit facility capacity just the same as actual borrowings 
claims against letters of credit are rare in our industry 
to date we have not had a claim made against a letter of credit that resulted in payments by our lenders or by us 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under a letter of credit in the foreseeable future 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors who provided goods and services under a contract 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs 
to date  we are not aware of any losses to our surety in connection with bonds the surety has posted on our behalf  and we do not expect such losses to be incurred in the foreseeable future 
surety market conditions are currently difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately of our business has required bonds 
while we have enjoyed a longstanding relationship with our surety  current market conditions as well as changes in our surety s assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our surety to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
we would likely also encounter concerns from customers  suppliers and other market participants as to our creditworthiness 
while we believe our general operating and financial performance would enable us to ultimately respond effectively to an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  such an interruption would likely cause our revenues and profits to decline in the near term 
the following recaps the future maturities of our debt along with other contractual obligations 
debt maturities in this recap are based on amounts outstanding as of february  while operating lease maturities are based on amounts outstanding as of december  in thousands twelve months ended december  thereafter total revolving loan   term loan       other debt total debt      operating lease obligations as of december  we also have million of letter of credit commitments 
while these commitments all expire in  we expect the majority of them  primarily those supporting our property and casualty insurance programs  will be renewed annually 
other than the operating lease obligations noted above  we have no significant purchase or operating commitments outside of commitments to deliver equipment and provide labor in the ordinary course of performing project work 
in addition  the million value of the warrant and put obligation included in other long term liabilities on our balance sheet substantially reflects the value of the warrant portion of the obligation that can be converted into equity by the holder 
because this conversion would not require a cash disbursement  we have not included this obligation in the table of commitments above 
outlook we have generated positive net free cash flow for each of the last three years in challenging economic and industry conditions  and we currently have a relatively low level of debt 
we anticipate that free cash flow from operations and credit capacity under the facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
seasonality and cyclicality the hvac industry is subject to seasonal variations 
specifically  the demand for new installation and replacement is generally lower during the winter months the first quarter of the year due to reduced construction activity during inclement weather and less use of air conditioning during the colder months 
demand for hvac services is generally higher in the second and third calendar quarters due to increased construction activity and increased use of air conditioning during the warmer months 
accordingly  we expect our revenues and operating results generally will be lower in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
historically  the construction industry has been highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines in new installation and replacement projects in various geographic regions of the united states 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as restructurings  involuntarily terminating employees  and consolidating facilities  where those activities were initiated after december  the implementation of sfas no 
does not require the restatement of previously issued financial statements 
see note  restructuring charges  of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of restructuring charges recorded during in accordance with sfas no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 

fin no 
defines a variable interest entity as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity if that entity will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the variable interest entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
fin no 
is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of the pronouncement were initially to be effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  however  in october  the fasb delayed the effective date of fin no 
on these entities to the first period beginning after december  we determined that we do not have any variable interest entities at december  as defined by the pronouncement 
factors which may affect future results our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors  including the lack of a combined operating history and the difficulty of integrating formerly separate businesses  retention of key management  national or regional declines in non residential construction activity  difficulty in obtaining or increased costs associated with debt financing or bonding  shortages of labor and specialty building materials  seasonal fluctuations in the demand for hvac systems and the use of incorrect estimates for bidding fixed price contracts 
as a result of these and other factors  there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results or cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis 
labor and overhead costs account for the majority of our cost of service 
accordingly  labor management and utilization have the most impact on our project performance 
given the fixed price nature of much of our project work  if our initial estimate of project costs is wrong or we incur cost overruns that cannot be recovered in change orders  we can experience reduced profits or even significant losses on fixed price project work 
our success depends in part on our ability to integrate and further consolidate the companies we acquired from in building the company 
these businesses operated as separate  independent entities prior to their affiliation with us  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate the operations of these businesses successfully or institute the necessary systems and procedures  including accounting and financial reporting systems  to effectively manage the combined enterprise on a profitable basis 
historical results of such businesses are not necessarily indicative of our future results because  among other reasons  our subsidiary operations were not under common control or management prior to their acquisition 
there are also risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities resulting from the acquired businesses operations prior to the acquisition 
many customers  particularly in connection with new construction  require us to post performance and payment bonds issued by a financial institution known as a surety 
these bonds provide a guarantee to the customer that we will perform under the terms of a contract and that we will pay subcontractors and vendors 
if we fail to perform under a contract or to pay subcontractors and vendors  the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond 
we must reimburse the surety for any expense or outlays it incurs 
to date  we have not had any significant reimbursements to our surety for bond related costs 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will have to fund claims under our surety arrangements in the foreseeable future 
surety markets conditions are currently difficult as a result of significant losses incurred by many sureties in recent periods  both in the construction industry as well as in certain larger corporate bankruptcies 
as a result  less bonding capacity is available in the market and terms have become more restrictive 
further  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue bonds on a project by project basis  and can decline to issue bonds at any time 
historically  approximately of our business has required bonds 
while we have enjoyed a longstanding relationship with our surety  current market conditions as well as changes in our surety s assessment of our operating and financial risk could cause our surety to decline to issue bonds for our work 
if that were to occur  our alternatives would include doing more business that does not require bonds  posting other forms of collateral for project performance such as letters of credit or cash  and seeking bonding capacity from other sureties 
there can be no assurance that we could easily achieve these alternatives 
accordingly  if we were to experience an interruption in the availability of bonding capacity  our revenues and profits could decline 
key elements of our strategy are to both maintain and improve the profitability and cash flow of the individual businesses 
our level of success in this strategy  if any  will be affected by demand for new or replacement hvac systems 
in part  such demand will be contingent upon factors outside our control  such as the level of new construction or the potential for slower replacement based upon the overall level of activity in the economy 
the hvac industry is subject to both seasonal and cyclical variations  meaning that temperate weather and downturns in the domestic or regional economies will negatively affect overall demand for our services 
the timely provision of high quality installation service and maintenance  repair and replacement of hvac systems requires an adequate supply of skilled hvac technicians 
accordingly  our ability to maintain and increase our productivity and profitability is affected by our ability to employ  train and retain the skilled technicians necessary to meet our service requirements 
most of our operations compete on a local or regional basis 
attracting and retaining effective operating unit managers is an important factor in our business  particularly in view of the relative uniqueness of each market and operation  the importance of relationships with customers and other market participants such as architects and consulting engineers  and the high degree of competition and low barriers to entry in most of our markets 
accordingly  we devote considerable attention to operating unit management quality  stability  and contingency planning  including related considerations of compensation  and non competition protection where applicable 
the existing senior management at certain subsidiary operations is comprised of former owners who committed to stay with their operations after acquisition 
certain of these individuals have suffered losses in the value of our common stock or have lower incomes than they averaged when they owned their former businesses 
further  former owners generally have noncompete obligations that expire on the fifth anniversary of their date of acquisition  and thus these obligations have largely expired 
there is no assurance that we will be able to retain these individuals or find suitable replacements if such individuals leave the company 
the failure to retain or replace such management on a timely basis could negatively impact results from operations at such locations 
hvac systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations  including the clean air act and those regulating the production  servicing and disposal of certain ozone depleting refrigerants used in hvac systems 
there can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future 
our failure to comply  or the costs of compliance  with such laws and regulations could adversely affect our future results 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not necessarily be considered an indicator of future performance 
investors should not rely solely on historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  general conditions in the hvac industry  changes in analysts earnings estimates  recommendations by analysts  or other events
