item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cass information systems  inc provides payment and information processing services to national manufacturing  distribution and retail enterprises from its processing centers in st 
louis  missouri  columbus  ohio  and boston  massachusetts 
the company s services include freight invoice rating  payment processing  auditing  and the generation of cost accounting and transportation information 
cass also processes and pays utility invoices  including electricity  gas and telecommunications 
cass extracts  stores and presents information from freight and utility invoices  assisting our customers transportation and energy managers in making decisions that will enable them to improve their operating performance 
the company receives data from multiple sources  electronic and otherwise  and processes the data to accomplish the specific operating requirements of its customers 
it then provides the data in a central repository for access and archiving 
the data is finally transformed into information through the company s databases that allow client interaction as required and provide internet based tools for analytical processing 
the company also  through its st louis  missouri based bank subsidiary  provides banking services in the st louis metropolitan area and other selected cities in the united states 
in addition to supporting the company s payment operations  it also provides banking services to its target markets  which include privately owned businesses and churches and church related ministries 
the company  through the bank s subsidiary  gems  also develops and licenses integrated financial  property and human resource management systems to the public sector 
the specific payment and information processing services provided to each customer are developed individually to meet each customer s specific requirements 
these requirements can vary greatly from customer to customer 
in addition  the degree of automation such as electronic data interchange edi  imaging  and web enhanced solutions varies greatly among customers and industries 
these factors combine so that pricing varies greatly among the customer base 
in general however  cass is compensated for its processing services through service fees and account balances that are generated during the payment process 
the amount  type and calculation of service fees vary greatly by service offering  but generally follow the volume of transactions processed 
interest income from the balances generated during the payment processing cycle is affected by the amount of time cass holds the funds prior to payment and the dollar volume processed 
both the number of transactions processed and the dollar volume processed are therefore key metrics followed by management 
other factors will influence revenue and profitability however  such as changes in the general level of interest rates which has a significant affect on net interest income 
the funds generated by these processing activities are invested in overnight investments  investment grade securities and loans generated by the bank 
the bank earns most of its revenue from net interest income  or the difference between the interest earned on its loans and investments and the interest expense on its deposits 
the bank also assesses fees on other services such as cash management services 
gems earns most of its revenue from the license of its enterprise software solutions and its installation and maintenance services 
industry wide factors that impact the company include the acceptance by large corporations of the outsourcing of key business functions such as freight and utility payment 
the benefits that can be achieved by outsourcing transaction processing and the management information generated by cass systems can be influenced by factors such as the competitive pressures within industries to improve profitability  the general level of transportation costs and the deregulation of energy costs 
economic factors that impact the company include the general level of economic activity that can affect the volume and size of invoices processed  the ability to hire and retain qualified staff and the growth and quality of our loan portfolio 
the general level of interest rates has a significant effect on the revenue of the company 
finally  the general fiscal condition of the counties and municipalities that can benefit from gems enterprise software can impact licenses sold and related revenue 
currently  management views cass major opportunity and challenge as the continued expansion of its payment and information processing service offerings and customer base 
management intends to accomplish this by maintaining our lead in applied technology  which  when combined with the security and processing controls of the company s bank  makes cass unique in the industry 
this trend has been positive over the past years and management anticipates that this should continue in the low level of interest rates has had a significant negative impact on net income over the past few years 
while management doesn t anticipate that these rates will rise in the near term  the company is well positioned to take advantage of rising rates when they occur 
management is pleased with the growth in software revenue generated by gems and is making additional investments to continue this trend 
management intends to continue to refine risk management practices  monitor and manage the quality of the loan portfolio and maintain a strong financial and liquidity position 
critical accounting policies the company has prepared all of the consolidated financial information in this report in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates have been generally accurate in the past  they have been consistent and have not required any material changes 
there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and are described below 
allowance for loan losses 
the company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
although these estimates are based on established methodologies for determining allowance requirements  actual results can differ significantly from estimated results 
these policies affect all segments of the company with the exception of governmental software services 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed in the allowance and provision for loan losses section of this report 
impairment of assets 
management periodically evaluates certain long term assets such as intangible assets including goodwill  foreclosed assets  internally developed software and investments in private equity securities for impairment 
generally  these assets are initially recorded at cost  and recognition of impairment is required when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets will not be recoverable in the future 
if impairment occurs  various methods of measuring impairment may be called for depending on the circumstances and type of asset  including quoted market prices  estimates based on similar assets  and estimates based on valuation techniques such as discounted projected cash flows 
assets held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
these policies affect all segments of the company and require significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different results if conditions or underlying circumstances change 
results of operations the results of compared to include the following significant items payment and processing fees increased  or to  as the number of transactions processed increased  or to  this increase was driven by the expansion of the company s customer base and number of services provided as well as an increase in national freight activity during the second half of the year 
net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased  or to  due to the dramatic decline in interest rates during the past few years 
this decline occurred despite the fact that total loans  typically our highest yielding asset for any given maturity  grew  or to  and average earning assets grew  or to  the growth in average earning assets was derived from both increases in deposits and accounts and drafts payable 
gains from the sale of securities were comparable to last year   in and  in on january   the company reclassified the foreclosed assets relating to its software subsidiary  gems  from held for sale to held and used and consolidated its operations into those of the bank subsidiary 
on january   the company s bank subsidiary foreclosed on these operating assets in order to protect its financial interests 
the bank sold these assets to a wholly owned subsidiary  and invested in and stabilized this business 
from the date of foreclosure through december   these assets were accounted for as a foreclosed asset held for sale 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  adopted by the company on january   requires that if certain criteria are not met for long lived asset disposal groups classified as held for sale by the end of the fiscal year in which sfas is initially applied  the related long lived assets shall be reclassified as held and used 
in revenues for this segment were  and operating profits were  bank service fees increased  or to  due primarily to the fact that as the earnings credit rate granted customers on their account balances decreases with the general level of interest rates  the amount of service fees charged increases 
other income increased  or to  due mainly to an investment in bank owned life insurance during operating expenses  excluding the effects of the gems consolidation  increased a modest  or to  due mainly to increases in salaries and health and worker s compensation insurance expenses 
the results of compared to include the following significant items payment and processing fees increased  or to  as the number of transactions processed increased  or to  this increase was driven by the expansion of the company s customer base and the services provided and offset the negative impact on processing volumes and fees caused by a decrease in national freight activity 
net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased  or to  due to the dramatic decline in the general level of interest rates 
this decline occurred despite the fact that total loans  typically the company s highest yielding asset for any given maturity  grew  or to  and average earning assets grew  or to  the growth in average assets was derived from growth in bank deposits  both interest and noninterest bearing 
gains from the sale of securities were  in  which mitigated some of the impact of the decline in interest rates

operating expenses increased  or to  due mainly to increased personnel expenses  equipment expenses and other expenses related to the increased volume and service offerings 
fee revenue and other income the company s fee revenue is derived mainly from freight and utility payment and processing fees 
as the company provides its freight and utility processing and payment services  it is compensated by service fees which are typically calculated on a per item basis and by the accounts and drafts payable balances generated in the payment process which can be used to generate interest income 
processing volumes related to fees and accounts and drafts payable for the years ended december   and are as follows december  in thousands transportation information services invoice transaction volume    invoice dollar volume    utility information services transaction volume    transaction dollar volume    fee revenue and other income in compared to include the following significant pre tax components freight and utility payment and processing fee revenue increased  or to  of the total payment and processing revenue  fees related to utility payment and processing increased  or to  and fees relating to freight payment and processing services increased  or to  these increases both relate to new customers and new product offerings 
utility processing volume and revenue  which represents a newer market  had higher percentage increases 
software revenue in of  represents the revenue of the bank s software subsidiary gems  which develops and licenses integrated financial  property and human resource management systems to the public sector 
prior to december   gems was accounted for as an asset held for sale and its operating results were not consolidated with those of the company 
sfas  adopted by the company in  now requires that gems be reclassified as an asset held and used 
consequently  cass reclassified the entity s net assets and consolidated its operations with the parent company on january  although unconsolidated in and  software revenue was  and  respectively 
bank service fees increased  or to  this increase was due primarily to the fact that service fees increase as the value of noninterest bearing deposits  used to compensate the bank for services provided  decrease as the general level of interest rates decreases

this new system offers the shipping community an expanded level of features  capabilities and ease of access

net interest income is a significant source of the company s revenues 
net interest income in compared to on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income for totaled  a decrease of  or from the net interest margin for was compared to in the following factors account for this decrease in net interest income and net interest margin the dramatic decrease in the general level of interest rates significantly impacted the company s net interest income and margin 
the prime rate decreased from at the beginning of to at the end of and the year treasury note rate decreased from to during this same period 
the average yield on earning assets decreased to in from in the company is negatively affected by decreases in the level of interest rates due to the fact that its rate sensitive assets significantly exceed its rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  the company is positively affected by increases in the level of interest rates 
this is primarily due to the noninterest bearing liabilities generated by the company in the form of accounts and drafts payable 
changes in interest rates will affect some earning assets such as federal funds sold and floating rate loans immediately and some earning assets  such as fixed rate loans and municipal bonds  over time 
more information is contained in item a of this report 
the company partially offset the decrease in net interest income through both an increase in earning assets and shift of earning assets to higher yielding asset classes 
total average earning assets increased  or to  this increase was funded by both an increase in accounts and drafts payable due to the increase in payments processed and an increase in bank deposits due to the expansion of the banks customer base 
total average loans increased  or to  this increase was attributable to new business relationships and was funded by the increase in accounts and drafts payable  growth in bank deposits and reallocation of earning assets from the investment portfolio 
although not enough to offset the decline in the level of interest rates  this increase in loans had a positive affect on interest income and the net interest margin due to the fact that loans are one of the company s highest yielding earning assets for any given maturity 
total average investment in debt and equity securities decreased  or to  this decrease was used partially to fund the increase in loans and partially shifted into federal funds sold and overnight investments 
total average federal funds sold and other short term investments increased  or to  this increase provides additional liquidity and positions the company to take advantage of higher interest rates should they occur

the company partially offset the decrease in net interest income through both an increase in earning assets and shift of investments to higher yielding assets 
total average earning assets increased  or to  this increase was funded by an increase in deposits generated by the bank 
the bank saw increases in both interest bearing deposits  as a result of increased marketing efforts  and noninterest bearing deposits  mainly from bank customers that maintained higher balances to compensate the bank for services and to avoid increased service fees in a lower rate environment 
total average loans increased  or to  this increase was attributable to new business relationships and funded by the increase in deposit liabilities and a reallocation of assets 
this increase in loans had a positive effect on interest income and the net interest margin due to the fact that loans are one of the company s highest yielding earning assets for any given maturity 
total average investment in debt and equity securities increased  or to  in addition to this increased investment  the company shifted its purchase of securities from taxable to tax exempt due to the higher tax equivalent yield such investments produce 
this increase and shift also allowed the company to partially offset the effect of lower interest rates

the company has no concentrations of loans exceeding of total loans  which are not otherwise disclosed in the loan portfolio composition table and discussed in item  note of this report 
as can be seen in the loan composition table above and discussed in item  note  the company s primary market niche for banking services is privately held commercial companies and churches and church related ministries 
loans to the commercial entities are generally secured by the business assets of the company  including accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and the real estate from which the company operates 
operating lines of credit to these companies generally are secured by accounts receivable and inventory  with specific percentages of each determined on a customer by customer basis based on various factors including the type of business 
intermediate term credit for machinery and equipment is generally provided at some percentage of the value of the equipment purchased  depending on the type of machinery or equipment purchased by the entity 
loans secured exclusively by real estate to businesses and churches are generally made with a maximum loan to value ratio  depending upon the company s estimate of the resale value and ability of the property to generate cash 
the company s loan policy requires an independent appraisal for all loans over  secured by real estate 
company management monitors the local economy in an attempt to determine whether it has had a significant deteriorating effect on such real estate credits 
when problems are identified  appraised values are updated on a continual basis  either internally or through an updated external appraisal

nonperforming loans are more fully explained in the section entitled nonperforming assets in item of this report 
the allowance for loan losses has been established and is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
an ongoing assessment of risk of loss is performed to determine if the current balance of the allowance is adequate to cover probable losses in the portfolio 
a charge or credit is made to expense to cover any deficiency or reduce any excess 
the current methodology employed to determine the appropriate allowance consists of two components  specific and general 
the company develops specific valuation allowances on commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans based on individual review of these loans and our estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and collection options available to us 
the general component relates to all other loans  which are evaluated based on loan grade 
the loan grade assigned to each loan is typically evaluated on an annual basis  unless circumstances require interim evaluation 
the company assigns a reserve amount consistent with each loan s rating category 
the reserve amount is based on derived loss experience over prescribed periods 
in addition to the amounts derived from the loan grades  a portion is added to the general reserve to take into account other factors including national and local economic conditions  downturns in specific industries including loss in collateral value  trends in credit quality at the company and the banking industry  and trends in risk rating changes 
as part of their examination process  federal and state agencies review the company s methodology for maintaining the allowance for loan losses and the balance in the account 
these agencies may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and interpretations about information available to them at the time of their examination

interest bearing deposits increased  or from december  to  at december  the average balances of these deposits increased  or from to  in these increases relate mainly to the bank s increased marketing efforts to attract more deposits 
accounts and drafts payable generated by the company in its payment processing operations increased  or from december  to  at december  the average balances of these funds increased  or from to  in these increases relate to the increase in dollars processed 
due to the company s payment processing cycle  average balances are much more indicative of the underlying activity than period end balances since point in time comparisons can be misleading if the comparison dates fall on different days of the week 
the composition of average deposits and the average rates paid on those deposits is represented in the table entitled distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  interest rate and interest differential which is included earlier in this discussion 
the company does not have any significant deposits from foreign depositors 
maturities of certificates of deposits of  or more at december  dollars in thousands three months or less  three to six months  six to twelve months  over twelve months  total  short term borrowings short term borrowings decreased  or from december  to  at december  average balances of these funds decreased  or from to  during these funds consist primarily of federal funds purchased and can also include tax deposits of the united states treasury 
the borrowings at december  were used to fund a decrease in accounts and drafts payable due to a combination of special year end funding arrangements with large customers  seasonality and the last day of the year being the low point of the weekly payment cycle 
these balances can vary significantly from day to day due to the company s payment cycle and therefore balances on any particular day are not necessarily reflective of balances throughout the year 
for more information on borrowings please refer to item  note of this report 
liquidity the discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the company seeks to ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to the freight and utility invoices processed as they become due  meet depositor withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time maximizing profitability 
this is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in the supply of funds 
primary liquidity to meet demand is provided by short term liquid assets that can be converted to cash  maturing securities and the ability to obtain funds from external sources 
the company s asset liability committee alco has direct oversight responsibility for the company s liquidity position and profile 
management considers both on balance sheet and off balance sheet transactions in its evaluation of liquidity 
the balances of liquid assets consists of cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  and money market funds  and were  at december   an increase of  or from december  at december  these assets represented of total assets 
these funds are the company s and its subsidiaries primary source of liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected loan demand  depositor withdrawals or reductions in accounts and drafts payable 
secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing lines 
total investment in debt and equity securities was  at december   a slight decrease of  from december  these assets represented of total assets at december  of this total  were state and political subdivision securities  were us treasury securities  were us government agencies and were other securities 
of the total portfolio  mature in one year  matures in one to five years  and matures in five or more years 
during the year the company sold securities with a market value of  and a portion of these funds were reinvested in state and political subdivision securities and the loan portfolio 
the bank has unsecured lines at correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up to a maximum of  additionally  the bank maintains a line of credit at an unaffiliated financial institution in the maximum amount of  collateralized by securities sold under repurchase agreements 
the deposits of the company s banking subsidiary have historically been stable  consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that utilize many other commercial products of the bank 
the accounts and drafts payable generated by the company has also historically been a stable source of funds 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for the years  and were   and  respectively 
net income plus the adjustment for depreciation and amortization accounts for most of the operating cash provided and has grown consistently over the past three years 
net cash flows from investing and financing activities fluctuate greatly as the company actively manages its investment and loan portfolios and customer activity influences changes in deposit and accounts and drafts payable balances 
further analysis of the changes in these account balances is discussed earlier in this report 
due to the daily fluctuations in these account balances  the analysis of changes in average balances  also discussed earlier in this report  can be more indicative of underlying activity than the period end balances used in the statements of cash flows 
management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents  maturing investments and cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund the company s operations and capital expenditures in other off balance sheet activities in the normal course of business  the company is party to activities that contain credit  market and operational risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the company s consolidated financial statements 
such activities include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments and commitments under operating leases 
the company provides customers with off balance sheet credit support through unused loan commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit 
summarized credit related financial instruments  including both commitments to extend credit and letters of credit and operating lease commitments at december  are as follows amount of commitment expiration per period less than dollars in thousands at december  total year years years unused loan commitments    standby letters of credit   commercial letters of credit operating lease commitments since many of the unused credit related commitments are expected to expire or be only partially used  the total amount of these commitments in the preceding table does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
capital resources one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital base to warrant the confidence of customers  shareholders  and bank regulatory agencies 
a strong capital base is needed to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities that arise and to provide assurance to depositors and creditors 
the company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory capital requirements  as evidenced by the capital ratios at december  as shown in item  note of this report 
in  cash dividends paid were 
per share for a total of  a increase over the prior year  which is attributable to an increase in the per share amount paid and additional shares outstanding 
on february  the company declared a stock dividend payable to holders of record on march  all per share cash dividend amounts have been restated to reflect this stock dividend 
shareholders equity was  or of total assets  at december   an increase of  over the balance at december  this increase resulted from net income of  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  and other items of  which was partially offset by cash dividends paid of  repurchases of stock of  and a decrease in other comprehensive income of  dividends from the bank subsidiary are a significant source of funds for payment of dividends by the company to its shareholders 
the only restrictions on dividends are those dictated by regulatory capital requirements and prudent and sound banking principles 
as of december   unappropriated retained earnings of  were available at the bank for the declaration of dividends to the company without prior approval from regulatory authorities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and its fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management discipline as applied at the company seeks to limit the volatility  to the extent possible  of both net interest income and the fair market value of equity that can result from changes in market interest rates 
this is accomplished by limiting the maturities of fixed rate investments  loans  and deposits  matching fixed rate assets and liabilities to the extent possible  and optimizing the mix of fees and net interest income 
however  as discussed below  the company s asset liability position differs significantly from most other bank holding companies with significant positive cumulative gaps shown for each time horizon presented 
this asset sensitive position is caused primarily by the operations of the company  which generates large balances of accounts and drafts payable 
these balances  which are noninterest bearing  contribute to the company s historical high net interest margin but cause the company to become susceptible to changes in interest rates  with a decreasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of declining interest rates and an increasing net interest margin and fair market value of equity in periods of rising interest rates 
the company s asset liability management committee alco measures the company s interest rate risk sensitivity on a quarterly basis to monitor and manage the variability of earnings and fair market value of equity in various interest rate environments 
the alco evaluates the company s risk position to determine whether the level of exposure is significant enough to hedge a potential decline in earnings and value or whether the company can safely increase risk to enhance returns 
the alco uses gap reports  twelve month net interest income simulations  and fair market value of equity analyses as its main analytical tools to provide management with insight into the company s exposure to changing interest rates 
management uses a gap report to review any significant mismatch between the repricing points of the company s rate sensitive assets and liabilities in certain time horizons 
a negative gap indicates that more liabilities reprice in that particular time frame and  if rates rise  these liabilities will reprice faster than the assets 
a positive gap would indicate the opposite 
gap reports can be misleading in that they capture only the repricing timing within the balance sheet  and fail to capture other significant risks such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
basis risk involves the potential for the spread relationship between rates to change under different rate environments and embedded options risk relates to the potential for the alteration of the level and or timing of cash flows given changes in rates 
another measurement tool used by management is net interest income simulation  which forecasts net interest income during the coming twelve months under different interest rate scenarios in order to quantify potential changes in short term accounting income 
management has set policy limits specifying acceptable levels of interest rate risk given multiple simulated rate movements 
these simulations are more informative than gap reports because they are able to capture more of the dynamics within the balance sheet  such as basis risk and embedded options risk 
a table containing simulation results as of december  from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates is shown below 
while net interest income simulations do a good job of capturing interest rate risk to short term earnings  they do not capture risk within the current balance sheet beyond twelve months 
the company uses fair market value of equity analyses to help identify longer term risk that may reside on the current balance sheet 
the fair market value of equity is represented by the present value of all future income streams generated by the current balance sheet 
the company measures the fair market value of equity as the net present value of all asset and liability cash flows discounted at forward rates suggested by the current treasury curve plus appropriate credit spreads 
this representation of the change in the fair market value of equity under different rate scenarios gives insight into the magnitude of risk to future earnings due to rate changes 
management has set policy limits relating to declines in the market value of equity 
the table below contains the analysis  which illustrates the effects of an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates as of december  change in change in fair change in interest rates net interest income market value of equity basis points basis points stable rates basis points basis points interest rate sensitive position the following table presents the company s gap or interest rate risk position at december  for the various time periods indicated
