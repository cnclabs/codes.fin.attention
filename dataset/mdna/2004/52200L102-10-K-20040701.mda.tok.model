table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company utilizes a week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to march fiscal ended april  and contained weeks 
fiscal ended march  and contained weeks 
results of operations comparisons will be impacted by the additional week in fiscal the results of learning centers opened  acquired or disposed of are included in the company s condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of opening or acquisition and through the date of disposition  except for those centers treated as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas the timing of such new openings  acquisitions or dispositions could influence comparisons of year over year results 
these comparisons were particularly influenced by the company s acquisition of substantially all of the assets of tutor time learning systems  inc  a florida corporation  on july  in fiscal  the company opened four new franchise and two new corporate tutor time centers 
the company also transferred one corporate center to a franchise owner 
during the year  the company chose to discontinue operations for seven of its corporate childtime locations that were not performing or whose contracts expired 
three franchise centers were also closed during during fiscal  the company added learning centers  which included the tutor time learning centers acquired at the end of the first quarter of  closed ten and transferred two learning centers to franchisees 
the company also closed nine centers during fiscal  whose leases were rejected as part of the tutor time purchase transaction 
also during fiscal  the company acquired the tutor time franchise business  consisting of franchise centers  franchised additional centers  terminated three franchise centers and took over the operations of one franchise center 
the company is subject to certain risks common to the providers of child care and early education  including dependence on key personnel  dependence on client relationships  competition from alternate sources or providers of the company s services  market acceptance of work and family services  the ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  the company s ability to manage its overall cost structure and general economic conditions 
critical accounting policies childtime prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these statements management makes certain estimates  judgments and assumptions  which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the amounts of revenue and expenses for each period presented 
the application of the company s accounting policies  in certain instances  requires the exercise of judgment and assumptions that pertain to future uncertainties and as a result  actual future results could differ from management s estimates 
the accounting policies management believes are critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  impairment of long lived assets  liability for workers compensation insurance obligations  and the consolidation of variable interest entities 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  which requires that the following criteria be met before recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s revenues consist primarily of tuition paid by parents  supplemented in some cases by payments either partial or in total from government agencies 
each agency has its own set of guidelines  including record keeping requirements  in administering subsidies and management must constantly monitor affected centers to ensure compliance 
revenues also include  to a lesser degree  management fees paid by corporate sponsors and franchise royalties and fees 
tuition revenue is recognized as services are performed 
in some centers  the company receives payment in advance of services being rendered  in which case  revenue is deferred until the services have been provided 
franchise fees and site development fees are recognized as revenue at the time the franchise center opens 
royalty income related to franchise operations is recognized as revenue is earned by franchisees 

table of contents accounts receivable 
the company generates accounts receivable primarily from fees charged to governmental agencies  franchisees and  to a lesser degree  parents 
the company monitors collections and payments from these customers and maintains a provision for estimated losses based on historical trends and current overall economic conditions 
amounts charged to this provision for uncollectible accounts receivable have historically been within the company s expectations  but there can be no assurance that future experience will be consistent with the company s past experience 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets under sfas and sfas during the second quarter of  the company completed the implementation of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas the company employed a discounted cash flow analysis to compute fair value in conducting its impairment tests under sfas the company also tests for long lived asset impairment  which consists primarily of equipment  leasehold improvements and other assets  as of october   in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company employed a cash flow analysis in conducting its impairment test 
at the end of fiscal and  the company again tested for impairment using the discounted  forecasted cash flows for the three segments of the company childtime corporate  tutor time corporate and franchise operations 
these cash flows were compared to the fair value of intangible and long lived assets for each segment  and it was determined that there was no further impairment 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows are subjective in nature and can be affected by a variety of factors  such as the economy  regulatory changes and changes in state mandated programs 
there is a potential for impairment charges in future years that would reduce operating income and asset values on our balance sheet 
liability for workers compensation insurance obligations 
the company has self insured a significant portion of its workers compensation insurance plans except during fiscal the full extent of certain liabilities  in many cases  may not become fully recognized for several years 
the company  therefore  estimates the potential obligation for liabilities which have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience  and utilizes an outside consulting firm to assist the company in developing these estimates 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in either the number of claims and or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on the company s financial results 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
during fiscal the company implemented fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in accordance with fin  the company has determined that some of its franchise operations are variable interest entities vie and the company has variable interests in these entities including royalty payments and in some cases debt  leasing arrangements and lease guarantees 
the company has evaluated  and will continue to evaluate  these relationships 
two franchise have been identified in which the company is the primary beneficiary and these two franchises have been included in the consolidated financial statements
