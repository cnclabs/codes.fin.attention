item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the town and country trust  organized in  is a real estate investment trust reit focused on the ownership and operation of middle income multifamily apartment communities in selected markets in the mid atlantic and southeast regions of the u 
s 
the company seeks to acquire additional apartments in certain of its existing markets  particularly in the greater washington  d 
c 
and baltimore metropolitan areas 
the company is also interested in pursuing multifamily investment opportunities in other high barrier to entry markets within its operating region 
in  the company acquired three apartment communities with an average age of years while disposing of five apartment communities with an average age of years 
the newly acquired assets are expected to have more predictable operating expenses and reduced capital expenditure requirements that will lead to better sustainable operating cash flows 
at december   the company owned apartment communities with  apartment homes classified as real estate held for investment and apartment communities with apartment homes classified as real estate held for disposition 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of real estate assets the company periodically evaluates its apartment communities for potential impairment indicators 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of the apartment communities 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the company s portfolio of apartment communities is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
real estate the company capitalizes expenditures made to acquire new assets  substantially improve the value of an existing asset or extend its useful life 
any expenditure to repair or maintain an existing asset in normal operating condition is expensed as incurred 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
in assessing estimated useful lives  the company makes assumptions based on historical experience acquired from both within and outside the company 
the company accounts for property acquisitions utilizing the purchase method  and accordingly  the results of the acquisition properties are included in the company s results of operations from the date of acquisition 
the company allocates the purchase price to the acquired tangibles  consisting of land  building and improvements  and if material  to identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of above below market leases and at market leases in place based on their fair values 
revenue recognition revenue from rental property is recognized when due from tenants 
leases are generally for terms of one year or less 
gains on sales of real estate assets are recognized pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of the recognition of the sale and the related gain is measured against the various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transactions and the company s continuing involvement  if any  associated with the assets sold 
to the extent the sales criteria are not met  the company defers gain recognition until the sales criteria are met 
discontinued operations on january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of any communities which have been sold since january   or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements in both current and prior periods presented 
the community specific components of net income that are presented as discontinued operations include net operating income  depreciation expense  minority interest and interest expense 
in addition  the net gain or loss including any impairment charge on the disposition of communities held for sale is presented as discontinued operations 
a change in presentation for discontinued operations will not have any impact on the company s financial conditions or results of operations 
real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell  and are presented separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
subsequent to classification of a community as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
hedge accounting the company carries all derivative financial instruments as assets or liabilities on its balance sheets at fair value 
changes in fair value of these instruments  which qualify as cash flow hedges  are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
any ineffective portion of the change in value is recorded to current period earnings 
results of operations the company s results include the results of both continuing and discontinued operations 
discontinued operations reflect operations of two apartment communities apartment homes that are being marketed for sale at december   and five apartment communities  apartment homes that were sold during the year 
results from these properties are reflected in the caption income from discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations 
the company s results from continuing operations consist of both same store results and results of new acquisitions 
same store results reflect results from  apartment homes owned and operated throughout both and results from new acquisitions include results from three communities apartment homes acquired in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income for was  or per diluted share  an increase of  from  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  included in net income is an  gain resulting from the sale of three communities in july and two communities in november also included in net income is a  impairment charge recorded on a property held for disposition 
the increase in operating and other expenses exceeded the increase in rental income for the year  despite the acquisition of three properties  resulting in a decrease in income before discontinued operations and minority interest 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in interest costs related to the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the effect of floating to fixed interest rate swaps  abnormally high weather related expenses associated with the harsh winter of  significantly higher energy costs  principally associated with natural gas rates  real estate tax increases and significantly increased insurance costs related to the annual renewal of the company s insurance program

this increase reflects an increase in the average amount of outstanding debt attributable to continuing operations during the year to million versus million during last year  primarily as a result of borrowings incurred in connection with the acquisitions and with the funding of the company s ongoing capital improvement program 
during the current year  the weighted average interest rate attributable to the company s average amount of continuing debt outstanding  excluding the convertible senior notes was compared to for last year 
discontinued operations for the year ended december   income from discontinued operations after minority interest was  compared to  for last year 
the income from discontinued operations year includes an  gain related to the sale of five apartment communities containing  apartment homes in the baltimore  maryland suburbs 
it also includes a  impairment charge recorded on one of the charlotte properties held for disposition at december  distributions to minority interest less than in excess of earnings accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that  for financial reporting purposes  an additional allocation of income be made to the minority interest account in an amount necessary to keep such balance from falling below zero since there is no requirement for the unit holders to make additional contributions 
during  earnings were in excess of distributions to minority interests and  therefore  the company reallocated the  that had previously been so allocated to the minority interests 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income for was  or per diluted share  an increase of  from  or

discontinued operations for the year ended december   income from discontinued operations was  compared to  for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of lower interest rates 
distributions to minority interest less than in excess of earnings accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that  for financial reporting purposes  an additional allocation of income be made to the minority interest account in an amount necessary to keep such balance from falling below zero since there is no requirement for the unit holders to make additional contributions 
an additional allocation of  was made to minority interest shareholders for the year ended december  funds from operations funds from operations ffo is computed as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap excluding gains and losses from sales and involuntary conversions of operating properties  plus real estate depreciation 
this computation of ffo is consistent with the formal definition promulgated by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
the reconciliation of ffo to net income  the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap  is included in the table below 
management generally considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing the comparative operating performance of the trust between periods or as compared to other companies  without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time and which can vary among owners of similar assets based upon historical cost and useful life estimates 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income as a measure of performance nor does it represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and  therefore  it should not be considered indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
while the nareit definition of ffo does not specifically address involuntary conversions of operating properties  management believes that such conversions are  in substance  sales of property 
since the nareit definition of ffo excludes gains and losses on property sales  the reported gain on involuntary conversion has  likewise  been excluded from ffo 
a reconciliation between net income and ffo is as follows in thousands year ended december  net income    income allocated to minority interest    gain on involuntary conversion gain on sales of operating properties  real estate depreciation    funds from operations     other data net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities    funds from operations for includes a  impairment charge on one of the charlotte properties held for disposition at december  funds from operations for includes a  charge for separation expense relating to the departure of two senior executives and one other officer
