insurance regulation general regulation as an insurance holding company  the company is subject to regulation by the state of new york  where the insurance company is domiciled  as well as all states in which the insurance company transacts business 
most states have enacted legislation that requires each insurance company in a holding company system to register with the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile and furnish to it financial and other information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
the company has registered as a holding company system in new york 
the laws and regulations of new york applicable to insurance holding companies require  among other things  that all transactions within a holding company system be fair and equitable and that charges for services be reasonable 
in addition  many transactions require either prior notification to or approval of the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york the superintendent 
prior written approval of the superintendent is required for the direct or indirect acquisition of or more of the insurance companies voting securities 
applicable state insurance laws  rather than federal bankruptcy laws  also apply to the liquidation or reorganization of insurance companies 
the insurance company is subject to regulation and supervision by the insurance regulatory agencies of the states in which it is authorized to transact business 
state insurance laws establish supervisory agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers 
principal among these powers are granting and revoking licenses to transact business  regulating marketing and other trade practices  operating guaranty associations  licensing agents  approving policy forms  regulating certain premium rates  regulating insurance holding company systems  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing the form and content of required financial statements and reports  performing financial  market conduct and other examinations  determining the reasonableness and adequacy of statutory capital and surplus  defining acceptable accounting principles  regulating the type  valuation and amount of investments permitted  and limiting the amount of dividends that can be paid and the size of transactions that can be consummated without first obtaining regulatory approval 
during the last decade  the insurance regulatory framework has been placed under increased scrutiny by various states  the federal government and the naic 
various states have considered or enacted legislation that changes  and in many cases increases  the states authority to regulate insurance companies 
legislation was passed in congress that could result in the federal government assuming some role in the regulation of insurance companies and allowing combinations between insurance companies  banks and other entities 
in recent years  the naic has approved and recommended to the states for adoption and implementation several regulatory initiatives designed to reduce the risk of insurance company insolvencies and market conduct violations 
these initiatives include investment reserve requirements  risk based capital standards  codification of insurance accounting principles  new investment standards and restrictions on an insurance company s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders 
the insurance company is required to file detailed periodic reports and financial statements with the state insurance regulators in each of the states in which it does business 
in addition  insurance regulators periodically examine the insurance company s financial condition  adherence to statutory accounting practices and compliance with insurance department rules and regulations 
as part of their routine regulatory oversight process  the nysid generally conducts detailed examinations every three years of the books  records and accounts of the insurance company 
the insurance company s last examination occurred during for the four year period ended december  the final report was dated on january  and it did not contain any significant issues or adjustments that impacted the financial statement 
the nysid is currently scheduled to commence an examination covering a review of three years ending december  regulation of dividends and other payments from the insurance company the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no other business operations  its primary sources of cash needed to meet its obligations  including principal and interest payments on its outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock  are rent from its real estate  interest on its investments and dividends from the insurance company 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances that it may make to the company without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year end and ii its net gain after tax from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year end excluding realized capital gains 
the insurance company will be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintendent does not disapprove the distribution 
under the new york insurance law  the superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders 
the nysid has established informal guidelines for such determinations 
the guidelines  among other things  focus on the insurer s overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices 
management of the company cannot provide assurance that the insurance company will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the company in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
the insurance company s insurance subsidiary is also subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to its parent company 
to preserve capital  the insurance company paid no dividends in fiscal and in  the insurance company paid dividends of million to the company 
the dividend limitation is based on statutory financial results 
statutory accounting practices differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 
the significant differences relate to deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves and reserve calculation assumptions 
investment reserves asset valuation reserve statutory accounting practices require a life insurance company to maintain an asset valuation reserve avr to absorb realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on a portion of an insurer s fixed income securities and equity securities 
the avr is required to stabilize statutory surplus from fluctuations in the market value of bonds  stocks  mortgage loans  real estate and other invested assets 
the maximum avr is calculated based on the application of various factors that are applied to the assets in an insurer s portfolio 
the avr generally captures credit related realized and unrealized capital gains or losses on such assets 
each year the amount of an insurer s avr will fluctuate as the investment portfolio changes and capital gains or losses are absorbed by the reserve 
to adjust for such changes over time  contributions must be made to the avr in an aggregate annual amount equal to of the difference between the maximum avr as calculated and the actual avr 
these contributions may result in a slower rate of growth in or a reduction of the insurance company s unassigned surplus 
the extent of the impact of the avr on the insurance company s surplus depends in part on the future composition of the insurance company s investment portfolio 
interest maintenance reserve the interest maintenance reserve the imr captures capital gains and losses net of taxes on fixed income investments primarily bonds and mortgage loans resulting from interest rate changes  which are amortized into net income over the estimated remaining periods to maturity of the investments sold 
the extent of the impact of the imr depends on the amount of future capital gains and losses on fixed maturity investments resulting from interest rate changes 
naic iris ratios the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and primarily is intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies industry ratios and specifies normal ranges for each ratio 
the iris ratios were designed to advise state insurance regulators of significant changes in the operations of an insurance company  such as changes in its product mix  large reinsurance transactions  increases or decreases in premiums received and certain other changes in operations 
these changes need not result from any problems with an insurance company but merely indicate changes in certain ratios outside ranges defined as normal by the naic 
when an insurance company has four or more ratios falling outside normal ranges  such state regulators may  but are not obligated to  inquire of the company regarding the nature of the company s business to determine the reasons for the ratios being outside the normal range 
no regulatory significance results from being out of the normal range on fewer than four of the ratios 
the company anticipates that it may from time to time fall outside the normal range on some of these ratios 
for the year ended december   one ratio fell outside the normal range 
this ratio  change in premium  decreased 
this decline was attributable to many factors  including recent rating agency actions and management s intent to preserve and build the insurance company s statutory capital and surplus ratios 
if four or more of the company s ratios fall outside the normal range  the company is likely to experience regulatory inquiry and a higher level of scrutiny 
assessments against insurers most applicable jurisdictions require insurance companies to participate in guaranty funds  which are designed to indemnify policyholders of insolvent insurance companies 
insurers authorized to transact business in these jurisdictions generally are subject to assessments based on annual direct premiums written in that jurisdiction 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s solvency and  in certain instances  may be offset against future state premium taxes 
the amount of these assessments in prior years has not been material  however  the amount and timing of any future assessment on the insurance company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the company and the insurance company 
any failures of substantially larger insurance companies could result in future assessments in material amounts 
regulation at federal level although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
current and any future federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of any such congressional activity nor the potential effects thereof on the company 
affiliates in addition to the insurance company  the company has four subsidiaries  presidential securities corporation  pl assigned services corporation  presidential asset management company  inc and the central national life insurance company of omaha central national 
on december   the company purchased central national from the household insurance group holding company  a subsidiary of household international  inc central national which has assets of million and capital and surplus of million as of december   is licensed to market insurance products in states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
in june  the ownership of central national was transferred to the insurance company as a capital contribution 
item properties the company owns  and leases to the insurance company  it s sole occupant  two adjacent office buildings located at lydecker street and north broadway in nyack  new york 
these buildings contain an aggregate of approximately  square feet of useable floor space 
the insurance company also owns two acres of unimproved land in nyack  new york 
management believes that the company s present facilities are adequate for its anticipated needs 
item legal proceedings from time to time  the company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business 
as of march   the company is not a party to any legal proceedings  the adverse outcome of which  in management s opinion  individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

balance sheet data at december in thousands assets total capitalization notes payable shareholders equity total book value per share net investment return on assets as shown in the selected financial data above  during recent years the company has achieved a substantial year to year growth in the sales of its annuity and insurance product  the proceeds of which have been placed in the investment portfolio 
this portfolio has been managed by the company with the objective of seeking the highest possible returns while investing primarily in investment grade debt securities 
in and the general economic recession caused a severe deterioration in many investment grade companies such as owens corning  mci worldcom  pacific gas and electric  southern california edison  us airways and sunbeam 
while some actually went bankrupt  many others lost their investment grade debt ratings with resulting market declines 
the company s investment portfolio realized losses or required substantial write downs with the result that net net losses were encountered in and in  these losses were million with an increase to a loss of million in a corollary impact of these was that capital ratios were adversely affected in both years 
recoveries in the market values were experienced which resulted in the company achieving record high levels of capital and improved capital ratios 
as described under ratings and regulation the company s business is substantially affected by such capital ratios and their impact on its rating 
consequently  the company s management established a policy of reducing the level of sales increases until capital and surplus ratios are further improved 
sales will also be made with a greater selectivity based on a profit review 
recently  as a result of such a review  the company has taken a planned emphasis on annuity products and a de emphasis  and in some cases  a discontinuance  of sales of the traditional life insurance of term and whole life 
earnings have been and may expected to be affected by the decline in interest rates  as described herein under market risk 
this is shown above in the impact of the decline on the net investment return on assets 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is engaged in the sale of insurance products with two primary lines of business individual annuities and individual life insurance 
our revenues are derived primarily from premiums received from the sale of annuity contracts and universal life insurance policies  from premiums received for whole life and term life insurance products and gains or losses from our investment portfolio 
for financial statement purposes  our revenues from the sale of whole life and term life insurance products and annuity contracts with life contingencies are treated differently from our revenues from the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products 
premiums from the sale of whole or term life insurance products and life contingency annuities are reported as premium income on our financial statements 
premiums from the sale of deferred annuities  universal life insurance products and annuities without life contingencies are not reported as premium revenues  but rather are reported as additions to policyholders account balances 
from these products  revenues are recognized over time in the form of policy fee income  surrender charges and mortality and other charges deducted from policyholders account balances 
profitability in the company s individual annuities and individual life insurance depends largely on the size of its inforce block  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting dicipline  the efficiency of its claims and expense management  and the performance of the investment portfolio 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the contacts requires  december   december  and december   respectively 
when we use the term we  us and our we mean presidential life corporation  a delaware corporation  and its consolidated subsidiaries 
in this discussion we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and beyond our control 
these statements may relate to our future plans and objectives 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the results indicated in these forward looking statements 
important factors  among others  that could cause our results to differ from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed under certain factors that may affect our business 
executive overview our earnings per share were for  as compared to losses of per share in and 
per share in our results in reflected a continuing of our year to year increase in investment income and a reversal in net realized investment losses from the prior years to a net realized gain in our total revenues in were million  as compared to million in and million in the company s performance in results primarily from the improved performance of our investment portfolio and our continuing efforts to reduce expenses and to reduce risk and exposure in our portfolio 
the improvement of global capital and equity markets in also contributed significantly to our financial performance 
certain factors that may affect our business there are numerous factors  some of which are outside our control  which could have a material impact on our business 
these factors include market conditions  legal and regulatory changes and operational risks 
a summary of these factors is set forth below market conditions we  like all companies  are affected by the general state of financial markets and economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
despite certain recent improvements in business conditions  the business environment in recent years has been difficult 
in this difficult environment  our ability to obtain desired returns on investment portfolio without exposing the company to excess risk has been very challenging 
this  in turn  has had an impact on our willingness to expand the sale of our single premium deferred annuity and universal life products 
since we rely substantially on the availability of reinsurance for portions of our life insurance and accident and health insurance  any material change in the reinsurance market could also have an impact on our business 
legal and regulatory risk as an insurance company  we are subject to substantial regulatory control 
any material change in the regulatory framework in which we operate could have a material impact on our business 
for further discussion on how we deal with our regulatory requirements  see business insurance regulation 
operational risk our business is dependent on our ability to process on a daily basis our payment obligations under our outstanding policies and the condition of our investment portfolio 
any failures in our internal processes  people or systems could lead to adverse consequences to the company 
in addition  despite the contingency plans we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by the disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the community in which we are located 
the following sections discuss specific factors that affect the company 
pricing management believes that the company is able to offer its products at competitive prices to its targeted markets as a result of i maintaining relatively low issuance costs by selling through the independent general agency system  ii minimizing home office administrative costs  and iii utilizing appropriate underwriting guidelines 
the long term profitability of sales of life and most annuity products depends on the degree of margin of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such products  and the ultimate profitability of sales of such products  are based on four major factors i persistency  ii rate of return on cash invested during the life of the policy or contract  iii expenses of acquiring and administering the policy or contract  and iv mortality 
persistency is the rate at which insurance policies remain in force  expressed as a percentage of the number of policies remaining in force over the previous year 
policyholders sometimes do not pay premiums  thus  causing their policies to lapse 
ratio of annualized voluntary terminations surrenders and lapses to mean insurance in force the assumed rate of return on invested cash and desired spreads during the period that insurance policies or annuity contracts are in force also affects pricing of products and currently includes an assumption by the company of a specified rate of return and or spread on its investments for each year that such insurance or annuity product is in force 
the following table summarizes the company s investment results for the periods indicated  as determined in accordance with gaap 
investment results year ended december  dollars in thousands cash and total invested assets net investment income effective yield net realized investment gains losses average of cash and aggregate invested amounts at the beginning and end of period 
net investment income is net of investment expenses and excludes capital gains and losses and provision for income taxes 
net investment income divided by average cash and total invested assets minus net investment income 
net realized investment gains losses include provisions for impairment in value that are considered other than temporary and exclude provisions for income taxes 
the reduction in the net investment income ratios is attributable to the low interest rate environment and other economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities with higher interest rates and callable debt securities increase 
during such periods the company  for the most part  will not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields 
another major factor affecting profitability is the level of expenses 
management believes that one of the company s strengths is its concentration on minimizing expenses through periodic review and adjustment of general and administrative costs 
mortality is the rate of death experienced by life insurance policyholders and certain annuitants taken as a group 
for calculating premiums  the company uses actuarial assumptions with margins added to allow for adverse statistical variations 
actual mortality experience in a particular period may be different than actuarially expected mortality experience and  consequently  may adversely affect the company s operating results for such period 
investments the company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
management evaluates whether impairments have occurred case by case 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  and vi other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect of the estimated fair value amounts 
the company derives a substantial portion of its total revenues from investment income 
the company manages most of its investments internally 
all investments made on behalf of the company are governed by the general requirements and guidelines established and approved by the company s investment committee the investment committee and by qualitative and quantitative limits prescribed by applicable insurance laws and regulations 
the investment committee meets regularly to set and review investment policy and to approve current investment plans 
the actions of the investment committee are subject to review and approval by the board of directors of the insurance company 
the company s investment policy must comply with nysid regulations and the regulations of other applicable regulatory bodies 
the company s investment philosophy generally focuses on purchasing investment grade securities with the intention of holding such securities to maturity 
the company s investment philosophy is focused on the intermediate to longer term horizon and is not oriented towards trading 
however  as market opportunities  liquidity  or regulatory considerations may dictate  securities may be sold prior to maturity 
the company has categorized all fixed maturity securities as available for sale and carries such investments at market value 
the company manages its investment portfolio to meet the diversification  yield and liquidity requirements of its insurance policy and annuity contract obligations 
the company s liquidity requirements are monitored regularly so that cash flow needs are sufficiently satisfied 
adjustments periodically are made to the company s investment policies to reflect changes in the company s short and long term cash needs  as well as changing business and economic conditions 
the company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and the company s net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline  the company s fixed maturity investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease as fixed income investments mature or are sold and proceeds are reinvested at the declining rates  and vice versa 
management is aware that prevailing market interest rates frequently shift and  accordingly  the company has adopted strategies that are designed to address either an increase or decrease in prevailing rates 
the primary market risk in the company s investment portfolio is interest rate risk and to a lesser degree  equity price risk 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is not significant 
the company has no direct commodity risk 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact the company s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  the company could be exposed to disentermediation risk and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margin 
risk based capital under the naic s risk based capital formula  insurance companies must calculate and report information under a risk based capital formula 
the standards require the computation of a risk based capital amount  which then is compared to a company s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset default  adverse insurance experience  disintermediation and external events 
this information is intended to permit insurance regulators to identify and require remedial action for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  but is not designed to rank adequately capitalized companies 
the naic formula provides for four levels of potential involvement by state regulators for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  ranging from a requirement for the insurance company to submit a plan to improve its capital company action level to regulatory control of the insurance company mandatory control level 
at december   the insurance company s company action level was million and the mandatory control level was million 
the insurance company s adjusted capital at december  was million which exceeds all four action levels 
agency ratings ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position in the insurance and financial services marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
in the event the company s ratings are downgraded  the level of revenues or the persistency of the company s business may be adversely impacted 
during  the insurance company s rating was lowered to b very good from an a excellent by am best company am best 
publications of am best indicate that the b rating is assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have achieved a very good overall performance when compared to the norms of the insurance industry and that generally have demonstrated a good ability to meet their respective policyholder and other contractual obligations over a long period of time 
in  the b rating was affirmed by am best 
in evaluating a company s statutory financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  leverage and liquidity  as well as the company s book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its reserves and the experience and competency of its management 
am best s rating is based on factors which primarily are relevant to policyholders  agents and intermediaries and is not directed towards the protection of investors  nor is it intended to allow investors to rely on such a rating in evaluating the financial condition of the insurance company 
during  moody s investor services moody s lowered the insurance company s insurance financial strength rating from baa to ba questionable financial security 
standard poor s corporation standard poor s lowered the insurance company s insurance financial strength from a to bb and is defined as less vulnerable in the near term but faces major ongoing uncertainties to adverse business  financial and economic conditions 
the credit rating of the company s senior notes  due february  the senior notes  was lowered to a b more vulnerable to adverse business  financial and economic conditions but currently has the capacity to meet financial requirements from a bbb by standard poor s and to a b poor financial security from ba by moody s 
for  the impact of the downgrades did not have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
the reduction in sales was primarily attributable to management s intention to preserve and build the insurance company s capital and surplus ratios 
surrenders of the company s annuity products continue to remain below of the surrenderable annuities and have not had a material impact on the company s consolidated financial sttements 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year and fiscal year to fiscal year revenues annuity considerations and life insurance premiums total annuity considerations and life insurance premiums decreased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately 
this decrease is attributable to a decrease in sales of the insurance company s single premium immediate annuities with life contingencies 
annuity considerations decreased to approximately million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million 
in accordance with gaap  sales of single premium deferred annuities are not reported as annuity considerations  but rather as additions to policyholder account balances 
based on statutory accounting  revenue from sales of single premium annuities were approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease is attributable to many factors  including management s intent to preserve and build the insurance company s capital and surplus ratios 
policy fee income universal life and investment type policy fee income was approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately 
million in fiscal and approximately 
million in fiscal the increase in is attributed to an increased number of life policies surrendered during that were within the surrender charge period 
policy fee income consists principally of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges and surrender charges 
net investment income net investment income totaled approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal this represents approximately a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal and approximately increase comparing fiscal to fiscal the full impact of the increase in sales for was reflected in the increase in fixed maturity income for income from fixed maturities totaled million in compared to million in and in investment income from other invested assets totaled approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company s ratio of net investment income to average cash and invested assets less net investment income for the years ended december   and was approximately  and  respectively 
for additional information  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the reduction in the net investment income ratios is attributable to the low interest rate environment and other economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities with higher interest rates and callable debt securities increase 
during such periods the company  for the most part  will not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable yields 
net realized investment gains and losses net realized investment gains pre tax amounted to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million of losses in fiscal and losses of approximately million in fiscal realized investment losses for years ended december   and include realized investment losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  attributable to writedowns of certain securities contained in the company s investment portfolio 
investment securities with unrealized losses are placed on an internal watch list and are carefully evaluated to determine whether such losses are other than temporary 
evaluations of watch list securities are monitored on an ongoing basis 
various criteria are utilized in the evaluation of the financial performance of the issuer  including capital structure  debt maturities  earnings trends  asset quality  industry trends  regional and economic trends and specific events including a company specific event  such as missed interest payments  accounting issues  gain or loss of major revenue generating contract s  significant change in availability and cost of raw material or labor  and  b specific market driven events such as dramatic changes in interest rates or geo political events 
we then evaluate these results in the context of our general intent to hold the investments to maturity barring any significant adverse change in credit conditions  as well as our need for liquidity 
when we determine that such conditions are not simply temporary  we adjust the book value to reflect the net realizable value or fair value  as appropriate  on a quarterly basis 
realized investment gains losses also result from sales of certain equities and convertible securities  and calls and sales of fixed maturity investments in the company s investment portfolio 
net unrealized losses the following table presents the amortized cost and gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by less than  or or more for december less than months months or more total fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses fair value unrealized losses description of securities in thousands us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us government agencies corporate bonds total the following table presents the total gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by december  gross unrealized losses of total gross unrealized losses net of principal protected notes of total in thousands in thousands less than or more for less than six months or more for six months or greater total approximately of the securities with an unrealized loss of or more for a period equal to or greater than twelve months are principal protected notes 
this structure utilizes aaa collateral such as u 
s treasury strips  in conjunction with a variable rate coupon 
the aaa rated collateral accretes to par at maturity  defeasing the security and thereby insulating the holder from any negative credit events which might interfere with the repayment of principal 
total benefits and expenses interest credited and benefits to policyholders interest credited and benefits to policyholders amounted to approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal this represents a decrease of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal and approximately a increase comparing fiscal to fiscal this decrease in and increase in was principally attributable to varying levels of policyholder account balances as a result of variations in annuity considerations received during the respective years 
the insurance company s average credited rates for reserves and account balances for the months ended december   and were less than the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets for the same periods as noted above under net investment income 
although management does not currently expect material declines in the spread between the company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances and the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets the spread  there can be no assurance that the spread will not decline in future periods or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
depending  in part  upon competitive factors affecting the industry in general  and the company in particular  the company may  from time to time  adjust the average credited rates on certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will reduce such rates or that any such reductions will broaden the spread 
interest expense on notes payable the interest expense on the company s notes payable amounted to approximately million in fiscal  approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal is attributable to lower interest rates on the company s million line of credit with the bank of new york 
general expenses  taxes and commissions general expenses  taxes and commissions to agents totaled approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal this represents a decrease of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal and a decrease of approximately comparing fiscal to fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to  is principally attributable to lower costs associated with lower commissions and selling expenses incurred associated with the lower level of sales of single premium annuities offset by the company s general expenses and taxes 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal is attributable to a reduction in the company s general expenses due to expense controls initiated in deferred policy acquisition costs the change in the net dac for fiscal resulted in a credit of approximately million  as compared to a credit of approximately million in fiscal and a credit of approximately million in fiscal such changes are due i to the decrease in costs associated with product sales which have been deferred and are amortized in proportion to the recognition of earned revenue and ii to the effect of revisions to estimated gross profits on unamortized deferred acquisition costs which are reflected in the year such estimated gross profits are revised 
income before income taxes for the reasons discussed above  income loss before income taxes amounted to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal income taxes income tax expense was approximately million for fiscal  as compared to a benefit of approximately million in fiscal and a benefit of approximately million in fiscal the increase in income taxes in fiscal was primarily attributable to realized capital gains in fiscal as compared to realized capital losses during fiscal in  the company s strategy was to utilize a carryback of its net capital losses reported in the company s consolidated tax return in net income for the reasons discussed above  the company had net income of approximately million in fiscal  net loss of approximately million in fiscal and net loss of approximately million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances  that it may make to us without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted without prior insurance regulatory clearance to pay a stockholder dividend to the company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year and ii its net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year excluding realized capital gains and losses 
the insurance company will be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend to the company in excess of the lesser of such two amounts only if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintendent does not disapprove the distribution 
under the new york insurance law  the superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders 
the nysid has established informal guidelines for such determinations 
the guidelines  among other things  focus on the insurer s overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices 
management of the company cannot provide assurance that the insurance company will have statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the company in an amount sufficient to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
to preserve capital  the insurance company paid no dividends in fiscal or in  the insurance company paid dividends of million 
the company s other insurance subsidiary is also subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends to their respective parent companies 
principal sources of funds at the insurance company are premiums and other considerations paid  net investment income received and proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold 
the principal uses of these funds are the payment of benefits on annuity contracts and life insurance policies including withdrawals and surrender payments  the payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
given the insurance company s historic cash flow and current financial results  management believes that  for the next twelve months and for the reasonably foreseeable future  the insurance company s cash flow from operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the insurance company 
the company is an insurance holding company and its primary uses of cash are debt service obligations  operating expenses and dividend payments 
the company s principal sources of cash are dividends from the insurance company  sales of and interest on the company s investments and rent from its real estate 
during  the company s board of directors maintained the quarterly dividend rate of 
per share 
during and  the company purchased and retired and shares of common stock  respectively 
at december   the company was authorized to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
net cash provided by the company s operating activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease from is largely attributable to the reduction in annuity considerations 
net cash provided by used in the company s investing activities principally reflecting investments purchased less investments called  redeemed or sold was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for purposes of the company s consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities relate primarily to dollar roll repurchase transactions  and to sales and surrenders of the company s annuity and universal life insurance products 
the payment of dividends by the company to its stockholders also is considered to be a financing activity 
net cash used provided by the company s financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily are attributable to higher policyholder account balances as a result of sales  the new line of credit established in  partially offset by the payment of dividends to the company s shareholders during fiscal year the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants relating to limitations on liens and sale or issuance of capital stock of the insurance company 
in the event the company violates such covenants as defined in the indenture  the company may be obligated to offer to repurchase all of the outstanding principal amount of such notes 
as of december   the company believes that it is in compliance with all of the covenants 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  we believe that our fixed rate liabilities should be backed by a portfolio composed principally of fixed rate investments that generate predictable rates of return 
we do not have a specific target rate of return 
instead  our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rate environment  the slope of the yield curve  the spread at which fixed rate investments are priced over the yield curve  and general economic conditions 
our portfolio strategy is designed to achieve adequate risk adjusted returns consistent with our investment objectives of effective asset liability matching  liquidity and safety 
in order to maintain consistency in our portfolio  our deferred annuity products incorporate surrender charges to discourage surrenders or withdrawals 
an annuitant may not terminate or withdraw funds from their annuity contracts for a significant initial period generally seven years without incurring substantial penalties in the form of surrender charges 
these surrender charges generally range from to of the investment 
approximately  and of the company s deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves as of december    and are surrenderable without charge 
the decrease since december  is attributable to the increase in deferred annuity contracts inforce as a result of the increase in annuity considerations 
the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio changes as interest rates change 
in general  rate decreases cause asset prices to rise  while rate increases cause asset prices to fall 
based on market values and prevailing interest rates as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase in interest rates of basis points would produce a loss in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
since the company is able to hold its fixed maturity securities to maturity  however  we would not in reality expect to realize significant losses under such a hypothetical scenario 
to meet its anticipated liquidity requirements  the company purchases investments taking into account the anticipated future cash flow requirements of its underlying liabilities 
in managing the relationship between assets and liabilities  the company analyzes the cash flows necessary to correspond with the expected cash needs on the underlying liabilities under various interest rate scenarios 
in addition  the company invests a portion of its total assets in short term investments approximately  and as of december   and  respectively 
the decrease in short term investments is attributable to the company s decision to no longer participate in dollar roll repurchase agreement transactions 
the weighted average duration of the company s bond portfolio was approximately years modified duration to call as of december  the company s fixed maturity investments are all classified as available for sale and include those securities available to be sold in response to  among other things  changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  the company s need for liquidity and other similar factors 
these investments are carried at market value  and unrealized gains losses  net of federal income taxes and deferred policy acquisition costs  if any  are charged directly to shareholders equity 
if a decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  the company recognizes a loss through the income statement 
equity securities including  common stocks and non redeemable preferred stocks  are treated the same way 
there were no capital expenditures during fiscal and no outstanding commitments as of december  the insurance company is subject to regulation adopted and promulgated by the nysid 
under this regulation  the insurance company s ownership of below investment grade debt securities is limited to of total admitted assets  as calculated under statutory accounting practices 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the insurance company s total admitted assets were invested in below investment grade debt securities 
the company maintains a portfolio  which includes below investment grade securities  which were purchased to achieve a more favorable investment yield  all of which are classified as available for sale and reported at estimated market value 
as of december  and  the carrying value of these securities was approximately million and million  respectively representing approximately and  respectively  of the company s total assets 
investments in below investment grade debt securities have different risks than investments in corporate debt securities rated investment grade 
risk of loss upon default by the borrower is significantly greater with respect to below investment grade debt securities than with respect to other corporate debt securities because below investment grade debt securities generally are unsecured and often are subordinated to other creditors of the issuer 
also  issuers of below investment grade debt securities usually have high levels of indebtedness and often are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions  such as recession or increasing interest rates  than are investment grade issuers 
typically  there is only a thinly traded market for such securities and recent market quotations may not be available for some of these securities 
market quotes generally are available only from a limited number of dealers and may not represent firm bids of such dealers or prices for actual sales 
the company attempts to reduce the overall risk in its below investment grade portfolio  as in all of its investments  through detailed credit analysis  investment policy limitations  and diversification by company and by industry 
below investment grade debt investments  as well as other investments  are being monitored on an ongoing basis 
as of december   approximately of the insurance company s total invested assets were invested in limited partnerships and equity securities 
pursuant to nysid regulations  the company s investments in equity securities  including limited partnership interests  as well as below investment grade bonds may not exceed of the insurance company s invested assets 
investments in limited partnerships are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet under the heading other invested assets 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is committed  if called upon during a specified period  to contribute an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
million in  million in  million in and in the company may make selective investments in additional limited partnerships as opportunities arise 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which is mitigated by the ability of the company to take annual distributions of partnership earnings 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to achieve the same level of returns on its investments in limited partnerships as it has historically 
further  there can be no assurance that the company will receive a return of all or any portion of its current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure of the company to receive the return of a material portion of its capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of return on such investments  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
as previously discussed  in fiscal and the company participated in dollar roll repurchase agreement transactions 
amounts outstanding to repurchase securities under such agreements were approximately and million at december  and  respectively 
the company may engage in selected dollar roll transactions as market opportunities arise 
all states of the united states  the district of columbia and puerto rico have insurance guaranty fund laws requiring all life insurance companies doing business within the jurisdictions to participate in guaranty associations  which are organized to pay contractual obligations under insurance policies and certificates issued under group insurance policies issued by impaired or insolvent life insurance companies 
these associations levy assessments up to prescribed limits on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer is engaged 
some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s solvency 
the amount of these assessments in current and prior years has not been material  however  the amount and timing of any future assessment on the insurance company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the company and the insurance company 
any failures of substantially larger insurance companies could result in future assessments in material amounts 
see item business insurance regulation for a description of certain naic initiatives that also may impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has made no financial commitments or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiary or special purpose entity 
all of the company s subsidiaries are wholly owned and their results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contain information regarding payments required under existing long term borrowing arrangements 
the following presents a summary of the company s significant contractual obligations 
payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years after years total long term debt obligations long term debt obligations consist of million  senior notes due february  see note in notes to the consolidated financials statements for additional discussion concerning both long term and short term obligations 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes in a rising interest rate environment  the company s average cost of funds would be expected to increase over time as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
in addition  the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio decreases resulting in a decline in shareholders equity 
concurrently  the company would attempt to place new funds in investments that were matched in duration to  and higher yielding than  the liabilities associated with such annuities 
management believes that liquidity necessary in such an interest rate environment to fund withdrawals  including surrenders  would be available through income  cash flow  and the company s cash reserves or from the sale of short term investments 
in a declining interest rate environment  the company s cost of funds would be expected to decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
should increased liquidity be required for withdrawals in such an interest rate environment  management believes that the portion of the company s investments which are designated as available for sale in the company s consolidated balance sheet could be sold without materially adverse consequences in light of the general strengthening in market prices which would be expected in the fixed maturity security market 
interest rate changes also may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of our universal life and annuity products 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the company s competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the company s products until the company increases the rates credited to holders of its universal life and annuity products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we would attempt to lower our credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in net investment income 
as a result  changes in interest rates could materially adversely effect the financial condition and results of operations of the company depending on the attractiveness of alternative investments available to the company s customers 
in that regard  in the current interest rate environment  the company has attempted to maintain its credited rates at competitive levels designed to discourage surrenders and also to be considered attractive to purchasers of new annuity products 
in addition  because the level of prevailing interest rates impacts the company s competitors in the same fashion  management does not believe that the current interest rate environment will materially affect the company s competitive position vis a vis other life insurance companies that emphasize the sale of annuity products 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if interest rates continue at current levels or decline  there can be no assurance that this segment of the life insurance industry would not experience increased levels of surrenders and reduced sales and thereby be materially adversely affected 
conversely  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the company s competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar investments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the company s products until the company increases its credited rates 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s business operations 
investments the company s principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default and management evaluates whether impairments have occurred case by case 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  and vi other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
in addition  the earnings on certain investments are dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned due to changing interest rates or equity markets 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market values is based on valuation methodologies  securities the company deems to be comparable and assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect of the estimated fair value amounts 
the following table summarizes the company s investment portfolio at december  this table consists primarily of fixed maturity investments available for sale  which are carried at fair value 
investment portfolio total carrying value dollars in thousands fixed maturities bonds and notes us government  government agencies and authorities investment grade corporate public utilities below investment grade corporate mortgage backed preferred stocks total fixed maturities equity securities common stock other investments policy loans real estate mortgage loans other long term investments cash and short term investments total cash and investments all fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale  accordingly total carrying value equals estimated fair value 
independent pricing services provide market prices for over of the publicly traded securities 
where prices are unavailable from pricing services  prices are obtained from securities dealers and valuation methodologies 
for other long term investments  estimated market value either approximates estimated carrying value or was not readily ascertainable 
see note c to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the methodology used to value other investments 
approximately million of such securities represent beneficial ownership interests in mortgage backed securities of fdic  fhlmc  fnma  gnma or the rtc 
ratings are based primarily upon those assigned by the naic 
includes approximately million of convertible preferred stock 
consist principally of investments in limited partnerships  which are accounted for under the equity method 
deferred policy acquisition costs thecompany incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new business 
these costs  which vary with and are primarily related to the production of newbusiness  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related product  which in turn is dependent mainly on investment returns in excess of interest credited  as well as  persistency and expenses 
these factors enter into management s estimate of future gross profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
changes in these estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the deferred acquisition asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross profits are less than amounts deferred 
future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the following section discusses the company s policy and practices regarding life insurance and annuity reserves 
life insurance and annuity reserves in accordance with applicable insurance regulations  the company has established and carries as liabilities in its statutory financial statements actuarially determined reserves that are calculated to satisfy its policy and contract obligations 
reserves  together with premiums to be received on outstanding policies and contracts and interest thereon at certain assumed rates  are calculated to be sufficient to satisfy policy and contract obligations 
the actuarial factors used in determining such reserves are based on statutorily prescribed mortality and morbidity tables and interest rates 
reserves maintained also include unearned premiums  premium deposits  reserves for claims that have been reported but are not yet paid  reserves for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported and claims in the process of settlement 
generally  the company maintains reserves on assumed reinsurance  but does not continue accumulating reserves with respect to that portion of policies or contracts that are reinsured with  or ceded to  other insurance companies 
reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed on bases essentially comparable to direct insurance reserves 
the reserves reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements included herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states in which the insurance company does business and those reflected in the insurance company s statutory financial statements 
these differences arise from the use of different mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions  the introduction of lapse assumptions into the reserve calculation and the use of the net level premium reserve method on all insurance business 
see notes g  h and to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the reserves reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements are based upon the company s best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
for all interest sensitive products the policy account value is equal to the accumulation of gross premiums plus interest credited less mortality and expense charges and withdrawals 
in determining reserves for its insurance and annuity products  the company performs periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  interest and lapse rates with expected experience in the reserve assumptions 
differences are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
the company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions 
employee benefit plans the insurance company sponsors a defined benefit plan covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the reported expense and liability associated with these plans requires use of assumptions which include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the insurance company 
management determines these assumptions based upon currently available market and industry data  historical performance of the plans and its assets 
the actuarial assumptions used by the insurance company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
during  the actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the company s projected benefit obligation include the expected rate of compensation increases of  a discount rate of and an expected return on assets of 
the projected benefit obligation at december  is million 
in february  in contemplation of a voluntary termination of the presidential life insurance company employees retirement plan  the company adopted a resolution which froze the plan as of february  this closed the plan to new entrants and terminated the accrual of any future benefits under the plan after such date 
in addition to freezing the plan  the company approved a resolution to utilize group mortality tables and a seven percent investment yield for use in computing actuarial calculations 
the company anticipates that a final decision regarding the termination of the plan will be made in or about the second half of item a
