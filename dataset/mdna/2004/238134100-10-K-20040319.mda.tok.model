item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an asp that provides edc and other services to companies in the clinical pharmaceutical  biotechnology  cro and medical device research industries 
we assist our customers in accelerating the completion of clinical trials by streamlining the collection of data relating to clinical trials  and improving the overall quality of the clinical trial data collected 

table of contents the discussion that follows highlights our business conditions and certain financial information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
approximately of our assets  or  is held in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
since commencing edc operations in  we have experienced some growth in revenue but continue to record losses and negative cash flow from operations 
we are continuing to develop and commercialize our business  and anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we use a technology platform that consists of windows compatible software and internet hardware known as datatrak edc to provide edc and other services to clinical trial sponsors and cros 
our future success is dependent on market acceptance of edc in general  as an alternative to the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  and acceptance of datatrak edc specifically 
we may be unsuccessful in achieving commercial acceptance of the datatrak process 
at december   our backlog was  compared to backlog of  at december  our december  backlog consisted of contracts with an average remaining value of  at december   our backlog consisted of contracts with an average remaining value of  our contracts in backlog at december  generated  of revenue during if we have no delays or cancellations to the contracts in backlog at december   we expect to convert approximately  of our december  backlog into revenue during our contracts can be cancelled or delayed at anytime and  therefore  our backlog  at any point in time  is not an accurate predictor of future levels of revenue 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the most critical accounting principles upon which our financial status depends 
critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies were identified to be those related to revenue recognition  software development costs and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition our standard contracts provide a fixed price for each component or service to be delivered  and revenue is recognized as these components or services are delivered 
services we provide that are in addition to those provided for in our contracts are billed on a fee for service basis as services are completed 
as services are performed over the life of the contract  we recognize revenue per the specific terms of each contract 
costs associated with contract revenue are recognized as incurred 
pass through costs that are paid directly by our customers  and for which we do not bear the risk of economic loss  are excluded from revenue 
the termination of a standard contract will not result in a material adjustment to the revenue or costs previously recognized 
in some instances  we offer volume discounts to customers over multiple contracts 
we estimate the volume discounts to be earned over the life the contracts to which the discount applies 
as contracts progress  revenue is recorded using rates that reflect the anticipated volume discount to be achieved by the customer 
the termination of a contract subject to a volume discount could result in a material adjustment to revenue previously recognized  in order to reflect the true economic value of the contract at the time of cancellation 
to date  we have not recorded any revenue at rates that anticipate the earning of volume discounts by a customer 

table of contents software development costs development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
such costs are amortized over the lesser of three years or the economic life of the related product 
we perform an annual review of the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
at the time a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are expensed 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb no 
 we recognize compensation expense for all stock options granted at less than the fair market value of our common shares on the date of grant 
the alternative fair value accounting provided for under financial accounting standards board fasb sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for their employee stock based awards using the fair value method 
however  the disclosure provisions are required for all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they utilize the fair value method of accounting described in sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method described in apb no 
we do not intend to adopt the fair value method of accounting and we have made the disclosures required by sfas no 
in our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations during and we recorded net operating losses of  and  respectively 
during these years our operating expenses continued to increase from  in to  including special items of  in our personnel costs  which have represented approximately of our operating expenses  also increased from  in to  in we had approximately and employees at december  and  respectively 
during the second half of  we took steps to reduce our annual operating costs  primarily through reductions in personnel costs 
these cost cutting measures enabled us to reduce our personnel costs to  and our total operating expenses to  during at december  we had approximately employees 
our revenue growth has been hampered by the slow growth of the edc market 
however  our revenue has continued to grow from  in to  in and to  in this continued growth in revenue together with the decrease in our operating expenses allowed us to reduce our net operating loss to  in at our estimated levels of revenue  projected operating costs and conversion of backlog into revenue  we anticipate that we will reach profitability during  and record income from operations for the year ended december  in order to grow the business  and consistent with our anticipated growth in revenue  we anticipate that we will have approximately employees at december  
table of contents the following table shows  for the periods indicated  selected items from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended december  revenue direct costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special items depreciation and amortization loss from operations other income  net net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the year ended december  included in revenue for the year ended december   is a one time fee of  the  fee relates to consulting work performed for a current customer that was outside of a traditional edc contract 
the remainder of the increase was due largely to greater acceptance of the datatrak edc software by clinical trial sponsors  resulting in an increase in the number of clinical trials using the datatrak edc software 
during  we recorded revenue related to contracts compared to contracts during direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit was  and  during and  respectively 
personnel costs decreased by  during due to the cost cutting measures implemented at the end of also during our internet service provider costs decreased by  due to decreasing rates 
these decreases were offset by a  increase in other direct costs 
these other direct costs are mainly travel expenses and other costs  which are billed to our customers 
the  decrease in direct costs combined with our increased revenue resulted in a gross margin of in compared to in based on our anticipated levels of revenue and our expected cost structure  we anticipate that our gross margin in will approximate the levels achieved in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include all administrative personnel costs  business and software development costs  and all other expenses not directly chargeable to a specific contract 
these expenses decreased by to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
staff reductions and other payroll cost savings caused personnel costs to decrease by  during the year ended december  cost reductions in other areas resulted in additional savings of  during the year ended december  the decrease in sg a expenses is consistent with what we anticipated when staff reductions and other cost cutting measures were implemented at the end of we anticipate approximately a increase in compared to as a result of increased personnel and growth of the business 
depreciation and amortization expense fell to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the decrease was the result of aging assets  whose replacement was deferred to future periods  not being replaced as indicated by the low level of capital expenditures during 
table of contents other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which decreased  for the year ended december  compared to december  primarily due to our use of cash to fund operating losses and other working capital needs 
during  we had federal alternative minimum tax of  due to income earned by our us based operations 
due to our consolidated net loss and our net operating loss carryforwards  we had no other federal  state or local income tax expense in at december  we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately  for united states income tax purposes  which will expire through the year we also had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately  euro for german income tax purposes with no expiration date 
due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we have fully provided for our deferred tax assets through a valuation allowance 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to greater acceptance of our datatrak edc software by clinical trial sponsors  resulting in an increase in the number of clinical trials using the datatrak edc software 
direct costs of revenue  mainly personnel costs  were  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit was  and  during and  respectively 
a  increase in personnel costs during was offset by a decrease in other direct costs 
these other direct costs are mainly travel expenses and other costs  which are billed to our customers 
we were able to leverage our prior period investments in personnel  in conjunction with our increased revenue to increase gross margin to in compared to in sg a expenses increased by to  from  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs of  caused by an increase in expenses related to sales and marketing  software development and corporate office personnel 
during  we recorded special charges of  included in special items is  of expenses associated with our proposed acquisition of oriam  sa  from which we withdrew in january also  during   of expenses related to the reduction of employees were recorded 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to  during the year ended december   from  during the year ended december  the increase was the result of depreciating capital expenditures associated with the development of our information technology infrastructure and amortizing leasehold improvements at our new corporate headquarters 
other income for the year ended december  totaled  compared to  for the year ended december  other income includes interest income  which decreased  for the year ended december  compared to december  due to our use of cash to fund operating losses and other working capital needs and decreasing interest rates on our short term investments 
due to our loss for the year ended december   no income tax expense was recorded 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
our investing activities primarily reflect capital expenditures and purchases and maturities of short term investments 
in august we received  in net proceeds from the completion of a private placement of our common shares 

table of contents contracts with our customers usually require a portion of the contract amount to be paid at the time the contract is initiated 
additional payments are generally received monthly as work on the contract progresses 
we record all amounts received as a liability deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue is recognized 
cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred or revenue recognized 
we typically receive a low volume of large dollar receipts 
our accounts receivable will fluctuate due to the timing and size of cash receipts 
our contracting and collection practices are designed to maintain an average collection period for accounts receivable of one to months 
any increase in our normal collection period for accounts receivable could negatively impact our cash flow from operations and our working capital 
at december   our average collection period for accounts receivable was days compared to days at december  accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts was  at december  and  at december  our increased revenue was offset by increased collections to allow the overall accounts receivable to decrease in deferred revenue was  at december  compared to  at december  cash and cash equivalents increased  during the year ended december  this was the result of  and  used in operating and investing activities  respectively  offset by  provided by and financing activities and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
cash used for operating activities resulted from the funding of net operating losses and other working capital needs 
investing activities included net cash uses of  from purchases and maturities of short term investments   used to purchase property and equipment and a  decrease in our restricted cash balance 
financing activities included the  in cash received from our private placement of common shares and other equity transactions  and  used to repay a capital lease obligation 
at december   we had working capital of  and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled  our working capital has increased by  since december  the increase was primarily the result of the  increase in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  due to our private placement of common shares 
changes in other current assets and liabilities caused working capital to increase by  we are party to two separate lease agreements  which require us to maintain restricted cash balances 
our total restricted cash balance was  at december  we intend to continue to fund the enhancement and testing of the datatrak edc software  as well as continue to invest in the development of the datatrak process 
our operations and the edc market are still in a developmental stage 
we have experienced revenue growth  and anticipate positive cash flow from operations during as we continue to build our customer base  increase our backlog and convert our current backlog into revenue 
we anticipate capital and related expenditures of approximately  for the twelve months ending december   for the continued commercialization and enhancement of datatrak edc 
of the  total   is required to upgrade current systems 
the remaining  is in conjunction with the anticipated growth of our business  and is to some extent discretionary 
additionally  we anticipate spending  for maintenance of our information technology infrastructure during we expect to fund these working capital requirements  from existing cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations 
we believe that  with the cost cutting initiatives we have undertaken and continued growth in revenue  our cash and cash equivalents  maturities of short term investments and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to offset delays or cancellations of contacts  support expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or technology or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we may raise additional funds by selling debt or equity securities  by entering into strategic relationships or through other arrangements 
additional capital may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional equity capital is raised  it could have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below shows our contractual cash obligations  expressed in thousands  at december  payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations inflation to date  we believe that the effects of inflation have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
foreign currency risk our foreign results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations through both foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation adjustments 
we manage our risk to foreign currency transaction adjustments by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our financial position and results of operations are impacted by translation adjustments caused by the conversion of foreign currency accounts and operating results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
during the average exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar by increased by approximately 
the conversion of our foreign operations into us dollars upon consolidation resulted in a net loss that was approximately  higher than would have been recorded had the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar remained constant throughout information about forward looking statements certain statements made in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of exchange act 
all statements that address operating performance  events or developments that we anticipate will occur in the future  including statements related to future revenue  profits  expenses  income and earnings per share or statements expressing general optimism about future results  are forward looking statements 
in addition  words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are subject to the safe harbors created in the exchange act 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions and risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from any future results or 
table of contents performance expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
we have identified the following important factors  which could cause our actual operational or financial results to differ materially from any projections  estimates  forecasts or other forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
under no circumstances should the factors listed below be construed as an exhaustive list of all factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to review or confirm analysts expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements contained herein to take into account events or circumstances that occur after the date of this annual report on form k 
in addition  we do not undertake any responsibility to update publicly the occurrence of unanticipated events  which may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements contained herein 
we have a limited operating history and we have not had profitable operations 
we began providing edc services in and have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our performance 
we have recognized operating losses in each year since our cumulative operating loss since from edc operations totaled  at december  we anticipate that we will be profitable in however any number of factors  including  but not limited to  termination or delays in contracts  inability to grow and convert backlog into revenue or being able to quickly reduce costs if required  could cause us to record losses in and in future periods 
if we do not continue to enhance our software  we may not be able to meet the needs of our customers 
although the datatrak edc software has been used in clinical trials  its continued enhancement is necessary to provide additional functionality and services to meet the ever changing needs and expectations of our customers 
among the enhancements we have added to our software are features including electronic signatures  single user login for added security and multiple user access 
to date we have had limited edc revenue from which to support the costs of this continued software enhancement 
our potential future revenue may not be sufficient to absorb corporate overhead and other fixed operating costs that will be necessary for the success of the datatrak process 
our quarterly results fluctuate significantly 
we are subject to significant fluctuations in quarterly results caused by many factors  including our success in obtaining new contracts  the size and duration of the clinical trials in which we participate  the timing of clinical trial sponsor decisions to conduct new clinical trials or cancel or delay ongoing trials and other factors  which could cause our revenue predictions to be incorrect 
our expense levels are based in part on our expectations as to future revenue and to a certain extent are fixed 
we may be unable to adjust expenses in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result of our relatively small revenue base  any significant shortfall in revenue recognized during a particular period could have an immediate adverse effect on our income from operations and financial condition 
volatility in our quarterly results may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
our business strategies are unproven and we are in an early stage of development 
our efforts to establish a standardized edc process for collection and management of clinical research data represent a significant departure from the traditional clinical research practices of clinical trial sponsors 
the long term viability of our business remains unproven 
our strategy may not gain acceptance among sponsors of clinical research  research sites or investigators 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 

table of contents our future revenue may be delayed or lost if we experience delays in clinical trials or if we lose contracts 
although our contracts provide that we are entitled to receive revenue earned through the date of termination  our customers generally are free to delay or terminate a clinical trial or our contract related thereto at any time 
the length of a typical clinical trial contract varies from several months to several years 
clinical trial sponsors may delay or terminate clinical trials for several reasons  including unexpected results or adverse patient reactions to a potential product  inadequate patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of a potential product or decisions by the sponsor to de emphasize or terminate a particular trial or drug 
because of our low level of backlog and revenue  we may lose revenues if a clinical trial sponsor decides to delay or terminate a trial in which we participate 
we may lose future revenue if any of our customers decrease their research and development expenditures  or if we lose any of our major customers 
our primary customers are companies in the pharmaceutical industry 
our business depends on the research and development expenditures of companies in this industry 
the extent to which we rely on revenue from one customer varies from period to period  depending upon  among other things  our ability to generate new business  the timing and size of clinical trials and other factors 
in light of our small revenue base  we are more dependent on major customers than many of the larger participants in the edc industry 
during  three customers accounted for of our total revenue for the year 
our operations could be materially and adversely affected by  among other things  any economic downturn or consolidations in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries  any decrease in these industries research and development expenditures or a change in the regulatory environment in which companies in these industries operate 
changes in government regulations relating to the health care industry could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services 
demand for our services is largely a function of the regulatory requirements associated with the approval of a new drug application by the fda 
these requirements are more stringent and thus more burdensome than those imposed by many other developed countries 
in recent years  efforts have been made to streamline the drug approval process and coordinate us standards with those of other developed countries 
changes in the level of regulation  including a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our services 
several competing proposals to reform the system of health care delivery in the united states have been considered by congress from time to time 
none of these proposals have been adopted 
the fda s guidelines and rules related to the use of computerized systems in clinical trials are still in the early stages of development 
we cannot assure you that the datatrak process can be kept in compliance with these guidelines and rules as they develop 
any release of fda guidance that is significantly inconsistent with the design of datatrak edc may cause us to incur substantial costs to remain in compliance with fda guidance and regulations 
we may not be able to capture or establish the market presence necessary to compete in the edc market 
the edc market  which is still developing  and must compete with the traditional paper method of collecting clinical trial data  is highly fragmented 
the major competitors  in the edc market  include edc software vendors  clinical trial data service companies and in house development efforts within large pharmaceutical companies 
any current and potential future competitors have or may have substantially greater resources  greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged  thereby gaining market share or product acceptance to our detriment 

table of contents we may be subject to liability for potential breaches of contracts or losses relating to the unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
our services are supported by telecommunications equipment  software  operating protocols and proprietary applications for high speed transmission of large quantities of data among multiple locations 
in addition  clinical pharmaceutical and medical device research requires the review and handling of large amounts of patient data 
potential liability may arise from a breach of contract or a loss of or unauthorized release of clinical trial data 
our financial position could be materially adversely affected if we were forced to undertake the defense of  or were found financially responsible for  claims based upon the foregoing or related risks 
we maintain a  errors and omissions professional liability insurance policy to cover claims that may be brought against us 
this coverage may not be adequate  or continue to be available to us  in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates since we fund our operations through long and short term investments and have business transactions in euros 
a summary of our primary market risk exposures is presented below 
interest rate risk we have fixed income investments consisting of cash equivalents and short term investments  which may be affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our cash equivalents and short term investments with high quality financial institutions  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
investments are reported at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
a change in interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our interest income during the year 
foreign currency risk our foreign results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations through both foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation adjustments 
we manage our risk to foreign currency transaction adjustments by maintaining foreign currency bank accounts in currencies in which we regularly transact business 
we do not currently hedge against the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our financial position and results of operations are impacted by translation adjustments caused by the conversion of foreign currency accounts and operating results into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
a fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro at december  would have resulted in a  change in the foreign currency translation amount recorded on our balance sheet  due to foreign currency translations 
a fluctuation in the average exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro for the year ended december  would have resulted in a  change in our net loss for the year ended december   due to foreign currency translations 
during the average exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar by increased by approximately 
the conversion of our foreign operations into us dollars upon consolidation resulted in a net loss that was approximately  higher than would have been recorded had the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar remained constant throughout
