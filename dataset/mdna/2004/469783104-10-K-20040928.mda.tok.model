item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
recommends that all companies include a discussion of critical accounting policies used in the preparation of their financial statements 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by our management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  we believe that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
the accounting principles we utilized in preparing our consolidated financial statements conform in all material respects to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows valuation of receivables the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
the company continuously monitors payments from customers and a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts is maintained based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues  which have been identified 
while such uncollectible amounts have historically been within the company s expectations and provisions established  if a customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  additional reserves may be required 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally mitigated due to the large number of entities comprising the company s customer base  their dispersion across geographic areas and industries  along with the company s policy of maintaining credit insurance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out and average cost methods 
the company s inventories are comprised of high technology components sold to rapidly changing and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
the company evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors rendering inventories as unsellable at normal gross profit margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate market value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers governing price protections and stock rotations 
due to the large number of transactions and complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding the valuation of inventory at market value 
in addition  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual results may be different than those estimated 
goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies allocated to goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily represent franchise agreements and non compete covenants 
we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on our future operating results as the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant industry or economic trends 
when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets  the values of the assets are determined using discounted future cash flow techniques 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results which are used in the preparation of the projected discounted cash flows and should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and goodwill could occur 
new accounting standards in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas sfas no 
is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
the new statement requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
 which codifies  revises and rescinds certain sections of sab no 
 revenue recognition  in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the changes noted in sab no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items in our statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods shown net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss interest expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
income tax benefit loss from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal results from continuing operations net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of from million for fiscal approximately million of the increase in net sales is attributable to new supplier relationships associated with the acquisition of certain assets of the electronics distribution business of reptron electronics  inc reptron in june and the balance is attributed to internal growth 
we have seen an improvement in the demand for components throughout the electronics industry 
flat panel displays continues to represent our fastest growing product group 
flat panel sales increased from of our total net sales during fiscal to for fiscal our ability to sustain our sales growth will be partially determined by our ability to continue to market successfully our flat panel displays 
semiconductors continue to represent our largest product group in terms of net sales 
during fiscal  semiconductors accounted for of our total net sales 
our semiconductor sales grew during the fiscal year as a result of increased marketing efforts  improving market conditions  and the addition of certain strategic franchises that we added through our acquisition of reptron 
passive components have become very competitive in pricing 
with manufacturing being done almost entirely off shore  it has become difficult to pursue new opportunities 
although we continue to still have a strong presence in selling passive components  our passive component sales decreased to of net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal we have also increased our marketing of power supplies and printerheads 
these products have a higher selling price per component  usually require some design work to be performed and as a result often generate higher gross profit margins 
our sales to the far east represented approximately of our total net sales in fiscal these sales were primarily derived from business that we were already doing domestically that we were able to transition to the far east 
it is important to our ability to increase sales that we are able to expand our presence in the far east  which represents the fastest growth area globally in our industry due to its currently low cost structure 
gross profit was million  or of net sales for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal  an increase of 
management considers gross profit to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
gross profit margins are usually a factor of product mix and demand for product 
as discussed above  our passive component sales are decreasing 
historically  we have realized higher gross profit margins on passive components than semiconductors 
as a result  unless demand for passive components increase  we do not anticipate any material increase in our overall margins  and we do not anticipate any significant change in demand for the foreseeable future 
in addition  demand for our products may be adversely affected by events beyond our control 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million  or of net sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal the acquisition of reptron increased our sg a by million 
we continue to monitor all discretionary spending  without reducing personnel to the point that we cannot support sales growth 
our variable costs are primarily those costs associated with increases in gross profit dollars  such as sales commissions and bonuses 
management considers sg a as a percentage of net sales to be a key performance indicator in managing our business 
we believe that we already have in place the infrastructure to sustain our sales growth for the foreseeable future 
therefore  an increase in our net sales should result in a decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase is attributable to higher borrowing as a result of cash expended due to the acquisition of reptron and cash required due to the higher accounts receivable and inventory as a result of the growth in sales 
slightly higher interest rates also contributed to the increase 
any significant increase in our borrowing rates could significantly increase our interest expense  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
net loss from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the improved performance is attributable to the increase in our net sales and resulting increase in gross profit dollars  partially offset by the increase in sg a and interest expense 
we believe we have benefited during fiscal from the improved demand in the electronics industry and the integration of the reptron distribution business 
discontinued operations as described in item business discontinued operations  on september   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of our contract manufacturing subsidiary  nexus  for total consideration of up to million  consisting primarily of million paid in cash at closing and a million subordinated note from the purchaser payable in quarterly installments over the next five years 
net income from these discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share  for fiscal for fiscal  there was a net loss from these discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share 
increase in sales resulted in improved utilization of our fixed costs  resulting in increased gross profit 
combined net loss the net loss from both continuing and discontinued operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the improved performance was attributable to the increase in gross profit dollars in excess of the increased sg a during fiscal as compared to fiscal comparison of fiscal year ended june  fiscal with fiscal year ended june  fiscal continuing operations net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of  as compared to million for fiscal we have seen an increase in net sales to certain customers where inventory management programs have been implemented 
it has been our focus to offer value added services to enhance value 
although there are indications of improvement  including certain customers in different industry segments who have seen their business improve  it is too early to be certain when this will lead to a general recovery in our industry 
on june   the company acquired certain assets of the electronics distribution operations of reptron 
sales included in fiscal associated with the reptron acquisition were approximately million 
for fiscal flat panel display fpd sales represented approximately of our total distribution sales 
passive components represented approximately of our distribution sales and active components  including fpd s  represented approximately of our distribution sales during fiscal gross profit was million  or for fiscal  as compared to million  or for fiscal the fiscal gross profit includes inventory write downs of approximately million  of which approximately million was provided for in the fourth quarter of fiscal pricing of components continues to be highly competitive due to the availability of product 
our sales growth has been through the automated inventory programs  which have a high concentration of semiconductors that sell at lower margins 
we do anticipate our margins to improve slightly due to sales associated with the reptron acquisition  which historically have been at higher margins than ours 
sg a expenses were million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or compared to million in fiscal we continue to strive to operate more efficiently 
we continue to eliminate discretionary spending  while being careful not to impact our ability to service customers 
we do anticipate our sg a expenses to increase due to the reptron acquisition 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million  or 
the decrease is attributable to a reduction of the average long term debt balance for fiscal as compared to fiscal we do expect an increase in interest expense as a result of additional borrowings due to the reptron acquisition 
net loss from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss during fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
as a result of our decrease in sg a expenses and interest expense  we were able to reduce our net loss from continuing operations for fiscal  as compared to fiscal discontinued operations net loss from these discontinued operations was million  or per diluted share  for fiscal  as compared to million  or per diluted share in fiscal the increase in our net loss from these discontinued operations was primarily due to a decrease in sales from our discontinued unit in fiscal as compared to fiscal liquidity and capital resources to provide additional liquidity and flexibility in funding its operations  the company borrows amounts under credit facilities and other external sources of financing 
on december   we entered into a third restated and amended loan and security agreement with gmac commercial finance llc and pnc bank  national association providing for a  revolving secured line of credit 
this credit facility has a maturity date of december  and amended an existing  secured line of credit 
borrowings under the new credit facility are based principally on eligible accounts receivable and inventories of the company  as defined in the credit agreement  and are collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
at june   the outstanding balance on this new revolving line of credit facility was million  with an additional million available 
the credit agreement contains provisions for maintenance of certain financial covenants  including  among others ebitda and minimum net worth  as defined 
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings at june  was approximately 
at june   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
failure to remain in compliance with these covenants could trigger an acceleration of our obligation to repay all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  limit our ability to borrow additional amounts under the line of credit and put a requirement that we maintain an aggregate undrawn availability of million until certain financial requirements are achieved  which would reduce the undrawn availability to  the credit agreement includes both a subjective acceleration clause and requires the deposit of customer receipts to be directed to a blocked account and applied directly to the revolving credit facility 
accordingly  the debt is classified as a current liability 
the company s prior credit agreement was amended on september  to extend the maturity date to october   and was subsequently amended on november  to provide a waiver for noncompliance with our ebitda covenant for the quarter ended september  the prior agreement required us to maintain an  compensating balance arrangement with our banks in an interest bearing account  which was funded during the quarter ended december  the new credit agreement allows for the release of this  compensating balance arrangement and initially included an additional available amount under the line of credit of up to  the additional available amount at the time of closing was  declining by  monthly thereafter 
the interest rate under the prior agreement was based on the average day libor plus to  depending on our performance for the immediately preceding four fiscal quarters measured by a specified financial ratio 
the interest rate on the outstanding borrowings at june  was 
the outstanding balance on the prior revolving line of credit was million at june  effective september   the rate converted to the higher of the prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus 
effective november   the rate converted to the higher of the prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus 
effective december   the rate under the new credit agreement converted to the higher of the prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus  or at our option  the average day libor plus 
on september   our credit facility was amended to provide the lenders consent to our sale of our contract manufacturing subsidiary  nexus  and to change our a ebitda b fixed charge ratio and c minimum net worth covenants  as defined eliminates the remaining portion of the additional  of the additional available amount under the facility to zero  and require the cash proceeds from the sale of nexus to be used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the facility  and put a requirement that we maintain an aggregate undrawn availability of million until certain financial requirements are achieved which would reduce the undrawn availability requirement to  for fiscal  our net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the increase in net cash used is primarily attributable to an increase in our accounts receivable and inventory  which was partially offset by an increase in our accounts payable 
the increase in our accounts receivable resulted from the increase in our net sales for fiscal the inventory increase was primarily due to supporting specific managed customer inventory programs 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to million related to the acquisition of reptron in fiscal and to deferred payments of million for fiscal related to our acquisition in june of interface electronics corp 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for fiscal as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 
million for fiscal the increase in net cash provided is primarily attributable to the release of an  compensating balance requirement under our credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
for fiscal and fiscal  our inventory turnover was times and times  respectively 
the average days outstanding of our accounts receivable at june  was days  as compared to days at june  inventory turnover and average days outstanding are key ratios that management relies on to monitor our business 
in fiscal  we plan to make certain leasehold improvements to construct a  square foot fpd facility that will allow us to vertically integrate our entire fpd operation 
when the facility is completed  we will offer customers a one stop source for their fpd supply and integration needs 
the cost of this project is not expected to be material and will be funded with cash from current operations 
based upon our present plans  including no anticipated material capital expenditures  we believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future 
however  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity depends partially on our ability in achieving anticipated revenue and managing costs as well 
our planned expansion to the far east and construction of an integration center for our fpd sales will require capital expenditures that have been planned for by the sale of our contract manufacturing subsidiary nexus custom electronics  inc however  our cash expenditures may vary significantly from current levels based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  future acquisitions and capital expenditures  if any 
historically  we have  when necessary  been able to obtain amendments to our credit facilities to satisfy instances of non compliance with financial covenants 
while we cannot assure you that any such future amendments  if needed  will be available  management believes we will be able to continue to obtain financing on acceptable terms under our existing credit facility or through other external sources 
failure to maintain financing arrangements on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
based on the sale of nexus  on september   the company received million cash at closing plus a subordinated note for million 
the cash at closing will be applied against the company s outstanding line of credit 
this will increase availability  except for certain restrictions outlined previously in this section that were established in the bank amendment approving the sale 
these proceeds will be available to fund the anticipated expansion into the far east and construction of an integration center to support the anticipated growth of the fpd product 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt  nor do we have any transactions  arrangements or relationships with any special purpose entities 
contractual obligations this table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june  total years long term debt   capital lease   a  operating lease   b  c   total      a includes  from discontinued operations b includes  from discontinued operations c includes  from discontinued operations inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the last three fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to borrowings under our credit facility  which bears interest at the higher of the prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus 
at august   million was outstanding under the credit facility 
changes in the prime interest rate or the federal funds rate during the current fiscal year will have a positive or negative effect on our interest expense 
each fluctuation in the prime interest rate or the federal funds rate will increase or decrease interest expense for us by approximately million based on outstanding borrowings at august  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on other floating rate debt is not material
