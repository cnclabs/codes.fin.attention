determination of allowance for loan losses the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s best estimate of probable loan losses related to specifically identified loans  as well as probable incurred loan losses in the remaining portfolio 
reference should be made to note a to the consolidated financial statements included herein as item and to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following schedule sets forth the components of the allowance for loan losses at december  and this allocation is based upon the consistent  quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any category 
allowance allowance in thousands loan balance for loan losses loan balance for loan losses allocated component impaired loans graded loans homogeneous pools other loans unallocated component the allowance allocated to impaired loans for the years and was based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
graded loans are those loans that exhibit some form of weakness 
allocations to this group are based upon the historical loan loss experience of the grades assigned and upon specific allocations to specific loans 
an allowance is allocated to the various pools of loans considered to be homogenous based upon the historical loan losses of each pool 
other loans consist of those loans not graded or impaired or considered homogenous 
these loans are grouped by risk assignments  which are based upon consideration of collateral values  borrower financial condition and performance  debt service capacity  cash flows  market share  and other indicators 
allocations of the allowance to these loans are based upon historical loan loss experience of the risk assignment

loans and risk descriptions real estate loans nbc originates loans secured by commercial real estate  one to four family residential properties  and multi family dwelling units or more units 
at december   these loans totaled million or approximately of the loan portfolio 
nbc originates commercial real estate loans up to of the appraised value 
currently  it is the philosophy to originate these loans only to selected known borrowers and on properties in the market area 

table of contents of primary concern in commercial real estate lending is the borrower s credit worthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project 
to monitor cash flows of borrowers  annual financial statements are obtained from the borrower and loan guarantors  if any 
although many banks have had significant losses in commercial real estate lending  nbc  historically  has sustained few losses  and those losses were not significant relative to the size of the entire commercial real estate loan portfolio at the time 
nbc originates loans secured by first and junior liens on one to four family residences in their lending areas 
typically  such loans are single family homes that serve as the primary residence of the borrower 
generally  these loans are originated in amounts up to of the appraised value or selling price of the property 
in the past  very few losses from these types of loans have been experienced 
loans for multi family or more residential properties are generally secured by apartment buildings 
loans secured by income properties are generally larger and involve greater risk than residential loans because payments are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties 
as a result  these types of loans may be more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
cash flow and financial statements are obtained from the borrowers and any guarantors 
also  rent rolls are often obtained 
consumer and other loans nbc offers consumer loans in the form of home improvement loans  mobile home loans  automobile loans and unsecured personal loans 
these loans totaled million or of total loans at december  consumer loans are originated in order to provide a wide range of financial services to customers and because the terms and normally higher interest rates on such loans help maintain a profitable spread between the average loan yield and the cost of funds 
in connection with consumer loan applications  the borrower s income statement and credit bureau report are reviewed 
in addition  the relationship of the loan to the value of the collateral is considered 
all automobile loan applications are reviewed  as well as the value of the unit  which secured the loan 
nbc intends to continue to emphasize the origination of consumer loans 
management believes that its loan loss experience in connection with its consumer loan portfolio is favorable in comparison to industry averages 
nbc makes commercial business loans on both a secured and unsecured basis with terms  which generally do not exceed five years 
non real estate commercial loans primarily consist of short term loans for working capital purposes  inventories  seasonal loans  lines of credit and equipment loans 
a personal guaranty of payment by the principals of any borrowing entity is often required and the financial statements and income tax returns of the entity and its guarantors are reviewed 
at december   nbc s commercial business loans represented approximately of its total loan portfolio

introduction and management overview nbc capital corporation the corporation or nbc is currently a one bank financial holding company operating in eastern mississippi and tuscaloosa  alabama 
nbc provides full financial services  including banking  trust services  mortgage services  insurance and investment products to its market area 
nbc s stock is listed on the american stock exchange under the ticker symbol of nby 
on december   nbc signed a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding stock of enterprise bancshares  inc  enterprise the parent company of enterprise national bank  a million bank operating in memphis  tennessee 
this transaction  which is expected to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of  will be discussed in more detail later in this discussion 
during  there were two major external factors that significantly impacted the results of the corporation 
first  interest rates remained at forty year lows and second  the overall economy in nbc s market area remained very soft  resulting in overall low loan demand 
as a result of these two factors  nbc s results for were below last year s record earnings 
this is the first year since the formation of nbc in that the corporation has not reported higher core earnings on a year over year basis 
during  the corporation s net interest margin declined from to 
low interest rates caused reduced yields on loans during  as the loan portfolio  which is composed of variable rate loans and fixed rate loans  continued to reprice downward 
the low rate environment also lowered the corporation s return on its investment portfolio  as faster than anticipated pay downs on the mortgage backed securities caused the premiums on these bonds to amortize faster than anticipated and resulted in reduced yields 
even though the corporation s overall cost of funds was reduced during the year  rates paid on interest bearing funds could not be reduced as quickly as asset yields declined 
unfortunately  the low interest rate climate did not substantially stimulate loan demand in the corporation s markets  as a result  the corporation could not offset the margin decline with increased volumes 
even though loan demand was low  the corporation did not compromise its underwriting standards and therefore  the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio was good at the end of during  the corporation continued its progress in building non interest income  as this source of revenue increased to a record million 
the growth of non interest revenue has been and continues to be a major strategic goal for the corporation 
during  non interest income accounted for of revenues  up from in another goal of management in was to continue to hold down the level of growth in non interest expenses 
during  the growth in total non interest expenses was less than one half of one percent  compared to a increase in non interest expenses in during  net interest income was million below the level 
this decline was partially offset by a million increase in non interest revenues 
as stated above  non interest expenses remained relatively unchanged in all these factors resulted in the corporation reporting net income of million  or per share  in  compared to million  or per share  in 
table of contents as the corporation focuses on  management is very aware that the corporation did not show core earnings growth in and is clearly focused on taking steps to improve future returns and grow core earnings 
clearly  the corporation can do nothing to cause interest rates to increase or to cause the economy in its market to improve and loan demand to increase 
however  the corporation has several initiatives either in process or planned for to improve its net interest income 
first  the purchase of enterprise provides the corporation another source of income and access to strong loan demand 
enterprise serves the memphis msa  which is the th largest in the country and includes five counties and sixteen municipalities  with a population of million 
the msa experienced a growth from to the memphis msa adjoins desoto county  mississippi  the fastest growing county in mississippi 
desoto county s population grew from to the company believes this acquisition may help offset the slow loan growth in its current markets 
second  during early  the corporation plans to centralize the underwriting of consumer credit 
the corporation s consumer loan portfolio has declined for several years as competition has increased for these customers 
also  the low and zero rate loans offered by the auto industry have had a major impact on auto financing  traditionally an important source of consumer loans for the corporation 
management believes that this change will make the corporation more responsive to its customer s needs and therefore  reduce or eliminate the runoff of these loans 
third  early in  the corporation plans to begin using a new pricing model to price total commercial customer relationships  rather than separately pricing each loan 

in addition to these specific plans  the corporation will continue to look for ways to grow non interest revenues 
the entry into the memphis market should be a major factor in this effort 
also  during  the corporation opened a mortgage loan production office in the north jackson  mississippi market to take advantage of the strong growth associated with the opening of the nissan auto plant in that market 
there are plans to expand this office in the corporation will also continue its efforts to control non interest expenses in and will look for ways to improve its efficiency ratio 
currently  management expects  based on the available information  that interest rates will remain at their current levels during the first half of and trend up slightly during august or september  and the overall economy in its mississippi market will remain relatively flat to slightly up throughout the year 
strong growth is expected to continue in both the memphis and tuscaloosa markets 
if these trends move differently than expected in either direction or speed  it could have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
the areas of the corporation s operations most directly impacted would be the net interest margin  loan and deposit growth and the provision for loan losses 
significant events on december   the corporation signed a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding shares of enterprise bancshares  inc  the holding company for enterprise national bank  a million commercial bank operating in memphis  tennessee 
the acquisition is an all cash transaction valued at approximately million and is subject to regulatory and enterprise shareholder approval 
this acquisition is expected to close at the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of after the acquisition  enterprise national bank will operate as a separate bank subsidiary of the corporation  although enterprise national bank will be consolidated with the corporation for accounting purposes 
the funding for this transaction will come from million of trust preferred securities issued by the corporation on december  and a special dividend of million from national bank of commerce during the first quarter of in the fourth quarter of  national bank of commerce received approval for the payment of this special dividend from the comptroller of the currency  its primary regulator 
currently  the corporation intends to obtain the funds for this dividend by borrowing from the federal home loan bank 
under generally accepted accounting principles  this acquisition will be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
as a result  the operations of enterprise will be consolidated with those of the corporation for the portion of following the closing of the transaction 
at the closing of this transaction  the balance sheet of enterprise will be revalued to current market value by an independent third party  with each asset and liability being adjusted to its estimated value 
as part of this process  a core deposit premium will be 
table of contents established on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
this premium will be amortized against future earnings  using an accelerated method of amortization and a time period to be determined by the independent third party 
additionally  the recording of this transaction will result in goodwill being recorded on the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
the goodwill will not be amortized and will remain on the corporation s balance sheet  unless it becomes impaired under fas no 
 at which time the impaired amount would be written off 
until the independent appraisal is completed  the amounts of both the core deposit premium and the goodwill are not known 
management has estimated that the goodwill will be in the range of million to million 
since this is an all cash transaction  there will be no significant change in the equity of the corporation following the closing of this transaction 
assuming management s estimation of the range of goodwill is correct  the tangible book value of nbc s common stock will be reduced in the range of to per share from its december  value of per share 
accounting issues note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the corporation s accounting policies 
management is of the opinion that note a  read in conjunction with all other information in the annual report  including management s letter to shareholders and management s discussion and analysis  is sufficient to provide the reader with the information needed to understand the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
it is management s opinion that the areas of the financial statements that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgements  and therefore contain the most critical accounting estimates  are the areas of the provision for loan losses and the resulting allowance for loan losses 
the corporation s provision for loan losses is utilized to replenish the reserve for loan losses on the balance sheet 
the reserve is maintained at a level deemed adequate by the board of directors after its evaluation of the risk exposure contained in the corporation s loan portfolio 
the methodology used to make this determination is performed on a quarterly basis by the senior credit officers and the loan review staff 
as a part of this evaluation  certain loans are individually reviewed to determine if there is an impairment of the bank s ability to collect the loan and the related interest 
this determination is generally made based on collateral value 
if it is determined that impairments exist  specific portions of the reserve are allocated to these individual loans 
all other loans are grouped into homogeneous pools  and risk exposure is determined by considering the following list of factors this list is not all inclusive and the factors reviewed may change as circumstances change historical loss experiences  trends in delinquencies and non accruals  and national  regional and local economic conditions 
these economic conditions would include  but not be limited to  general real estate conditions  the current interest rate environment and trends  unemployment levels and other information  as deemed appropriate 
management makes its estimates of the credit risk in the portfolio and the amount of provision needed to keep the reserve for loan losses at an appropriate level using what management believes are the best and most current sources of information available at the time of the estimates  however  many of these factors can change quickly and with no advanced warning 
if management significantly misses its estimates in any period  it can have a material impact on the results of operations for that respective period and for subsequent periods 
in the normal course of business  the corporation s wholly owned subsidiary  national bank of commerce  makes loans to related parties  including directors and executive officers of the corporation and their relatives and affiliates 
these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other parties 
also  they are consistent with sound banking practices and within applicable regulatory and lending limitations 
see note n in the notes to consolidated financial statement and the corporation s proxy statement for additional details concerning related party transactions 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  loans to executive officers are generally prohibited 
however  the rule does not apply to any loan made or maintained by an insured depository institution  if the loan is subject to the insider lending restrictions of section h of the federal reserve act 
all loans to executive officers made by the corporation s bank subsidiary are subject to the above referenced section of the federal reserve act 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements contains a listing of all the corporation s affiliated companies 
in december  the corporation formed nbc capital corporation ms statutory trust i  under 
table of contents the laws of the state of connecticut for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities to partially fund the acquisition of enterprise bancshares  inc the corporation issued subordinated debentures of  to the trust  and the trust issued trust preferred securities and sold them in a private placement to an institutional investor 
the details of the financing will be discussed in the section of this discussion involving the corporation s liquidity 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
revised december the trust  which is considered a variable interest entity  is not consolidated into the financial statements of the corporation 
the only activity of this variable interest entity is the issuance of the trust preferred securities 
effective january   the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill  however  it does require periodic testing for impairment 
as a result of the adoption of the statement  the corporation did not amortize goodwill during and the corporation completed its impairment test in accordance with statement no 
in october  and concluded that no impairment write down was warranted 
at december   the corporation had approximately million of goodwill on its balance sheet  which will remain at that level unless it becomes impaired under the definition of impairment in fas no 
the amortization of goodwill during was approximately  or 
per share 
results of operations net interest income nii  the primary source of earnings for the corporation  represents income generated from earning assets  less the interest expense of funding those assets 
nii  which had increased by in  declined by in changes in nii may be divided into two components  first  the change in average earning assets volume component and second  the change in the net interest spread rate component 
net interest spread represents the difference between yields on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing 
in  nii declined by  from million to million  as net interest margin declined from to 
net interest margin is net interest income divided by the average earning assets 
as yields on earning assets continued to decline during the year  the extended period of low rates made it impossible to reduce the cost of funds in an amount sufficient to offset the loss of yield 
management stated in last year s report that if rates dropped or continued to stay at these historically low levels this situation could develop 
as can be seen in the following table  yields on earning assets declined by basis points from to 
this loss was partially offset by a decline of basis points in the cost of funds  from in to in also  due to the slow economy and low loan demand in its market area  the corporation only grew earning assets by million  or  during all of this growth came from the investment securities portfolio and federal funds sold 
in  nii increased by  from million to million  as the net interest margin increased from in to in even though yields on earning assets declined by basis points from to during the  the corporation was able to more than offset the decline by decreasing its cost of funds by basis points from to 
during the corporation was able to grow average earning assets by million  or 
in  loan yields declined from to  and the yields on the investment portfolio declined from to 
also in  the cost of deposits declined from to and the cost of other borrowings declined from to 
if rates continue downward or stay at present low levels  it will be very difficult for the corporation to continue to lower deposit rates below their current level 
as a result  the margin will remain under pressure  because asset yields will continue to reprice downward 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  an analysis of nii  including the average amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding during the period  the interest earned or paid on such amounts  the average yields rates paid and the net yield on interest earning assets on both a book and tax equivalent basis

the primary reason for these high charge offs was that in june of  the corporation charged off a million commercial loan that defaulted 
this loan had previously not been classified as a problem loan  and there were special circumstances surrounding the default 
the corporation has filed a claim with its bonding company to recover the entire million  however  it can not predict whether there will be a recovery 
in  the provision was increased to  in total  net charge offs decreased to million in however  when compared to  exclusive of the special charge off  the level of charge offs actually increased in this increase can be attributed to the overall condition of the economy and the continued softening in the market  especially in the consumer sector 
in  the net charge offs declined to million 
as a result  the provision for loan losses was reduced to  the economy in the corporation s market continues to be soft  loan demand continues to be low and the forecast is for a gradual recovery 
considering these factors  management intends to maintain the provision for loan losses in at its current level 
at this time  management expects this level will protect the corporation from any unforeseen deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio 
however  if at any time during the year  any or all of these factors change in expected direction or speed  the corporation will make the necessary adjustments in the provision to reflect these changes 

table of contents non interest income includes various service charges  fees and commissions collected by the corporation  including insurance commissions earned by galloway chandler mckinney insurance agency  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of national bank of commerce 
it has been and continues to be a strategic focus for the corporation to diversify its other income sources so that it can be less dependent on net interest income 
the corporation has been successful in its efforts  as other income has increased from million in  to million in  to million in this represents a increase over the two year period 
the growth has been throughout all major categories as can be seen in the following table service charges on deposit accounts insurance commissions  fees and premiums other service charges and fees trust department income securities gains  net other total during  the increase in non interest income was million  or 
as can be seen in the table  every category increased  except for the other category 
service charges on deposit accounts increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from increased account activity  more uniform application of account based fees and selected fee increases 
insurance commissions  fees and premiums increased by  or 
this increase resulted from a combination of increased business activity and overall higher premiums in the insurance industry 
other service charges and fees increased by  or 
the majority of the increase in this category came from a  or  increase in mortgage loan fee income and a  or  increase in retail investment income 
the mortgage loan fee income came from a record demand for mortgage loans in the low rate environment of even though the demand for new home loans was strong  the majority of the demand came from the refinancing of existing loans 
much of the demand to refinance loans came from mortgage holders coming out of adjustable rate loans and going into fixed rate loans at rates that were at forty year lows 
during the month of september  the rate environment changed as the long end of the interest rate curve went up  causing mortgage rates to increase 
this caused a dramatic decline in activity 
even though rates remain at a relatively low level  the demand to refinance existing loans has not substantially increased 
the corporation s mortgage loan pipeline has declined from its record level at june   of million  to million at december  because of this reduction in demand  management expects the level of mortgage loan fee income to be one half of the level 
the large increase in retail investment income can be attributed to the overall improvement in the equity markets in and the resulting higher level of activity 
trust department income increased by  or 
this increase resulted primarily from higher management fees related to the impact of the improvement in the equity markets on the values of assets under management 
during  non interest income grew from million to million 
approximately of the total increase came from a million  or a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
in  the corporation upgraded the technology platform that it uses  to include more sophisticated account modeling 
this gave management the tools needed to better monitor and more uniformly apply the account based fees across all deposit accounts on a consistent basis 
insurance commissions  fees and premiums increased by  or 
this change in insurance commissions  fees and premiums relates directly to the volume of insurance product sold during these periods 
other service charges and fees also increased by  or  coming from three areas 
first  mortgage loan fee income increased by  to a level of  mortgage activity benefited from the continued demand for loans in the low interest rate environment of also the demand for mortgage refinancing  which had moderated during the first half of the year  began to increase once again during the last half of the year as interest rates fell 
also  during the year  
table of contents the demand for new loans was strong 
with this high level of activity at year end  the pipeline for both new and refinanced mortgage loans remained strong going into the other two areas that caused the increase in other service charges and fees were atm income  which increased by  and check card income  which increased by 
trust department income increased by to million 
even though the trust department was able to continue to grow its assets under management during the year  its income is generated based on the market value of these assets 
therefore  its growth in income was limited by the overall conditions in the equity markets as they continued to decline throughout the corporation recognized  in securities gains during  compared to  in and  for approximately of the gain and of the gain came in the period from july  to june  with a large portion of available for sale securities portfolio composed of mortgage backed securities  the corporation took advantage of a unique interest rate environment that developed during the second half of and continued during the first half of this rate environment allowed certain securities to be sold at a gain and replaced with similar securities with yields at or above the level of the securities sold 
this opportunity resulted from the rapid prepayment of some mortgage backed securities which reduced their yields and average lives and made them attractive at premium prices to short term investors 
the corporation took advantage of this opportunity to improve portfolio yields without extending maturities beyond acceptable levels  and at the same time  to recognize gains 
it is not anticipated that this situation will reoccur in the gain in resulted primarily from several securities that had been purchased at a discount being called  at par value  because of the low interest rate environment 
non interest expense represents ordinary overhead expenses  including salaries  bonuses and benefits 
the corporation maintains a formal salary administration program that considers extensive comparative salary data and other indices supplied by a leading outside consulting firm 
this data is utilized to assure that salaries are in line and competitive with comparable jobs in the marketplace 
incentive bonuses were expensed in and paid to employees based on the attainment of predetermined profit goals 
the predetermined profit goals were not reached in and  therefore  no significant bonuses were accrued in either of these years 
overall  the corporation has been successful in its efforts to limit the growth in non interest expenses  as these expenses increased from million in to million in to million in this represents only a increase over this two year period 
salaries employees benefits net occupancy expense furniture and equipment expense other total during  the increase in non interest expenses was limited to only  or 
salaries declined in by  or 
as stated earlier  the profit goals for were not achieved  therefore  no bonuses were accrued during the year 
also  through attrition  the corporation was able to reduce the overall number of employees 
the savings from these two areas were somewhat offset by normal salary increases during the year 
employee benefits increased by  or 
this entire increase resulted in higher pension cost 
even though the recovery in the equity markets greatly improved the returns earned on the plan assets during the year  the impact of low interest rates on the present value calculation caused the total expense of the plan  as computed by the actuary  to increase 
the combined change in net occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense created a reduction of  the other expense category increased by  or 
primarily all this increase came in the area of marketing  as the corporation began a new branding campaign during during the entire increase in non interest expense of million  or can be attributed to increases in salaries and benefits 
salaries increased by  or million 
approximately of this increase came from bonuses and related expenses that were accrued in as stated above  no bonuses were accrued in the remaining portion of the salary increase was due to normal salary increases for the year 
employee benefits increased by  or  in like most companies  nbc experienced an increase in 
table of contents medical insurance premiums during the year 
also  the benefit cost increased due the effects on the defined benefit plan of the lower rate environment on the present value calculations and low returns in the plan s investment portfolio due to the weak equity markets 
additionally  net occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense increased by  or 
this small increase came primarily from higher maintenance and repair cost during the year 
these increases were partially offset by a  or  decrease in other expenses changes in the corporation s income tax expense have generally paralleled changes in pre tax income 
the corporation s effective tax rates were in  in and in these changes in both years resulted primarily from the mix of income from tax free investments and the percentage relationship of tax free income to total pre tax income 
the corporation s ability to reduce income tax expense by acquiring additional tax free investments is limited by the alternative minimum tax provision  the market supply of acceptable municipal securities  the level of tax exempt yields and the corporation s normal liquidity and balance sheet structure requirements 
in summary  net income increased from million  or per diluted share  in  to million or per diluted share  in  and then decreased to million  or by per diluted share  in all earnings per share amounts have been restated to reflect the four for three stock split  accounted for as a stock dividend that occurred during the third quarter of financial condition during  the corporation s balance sheet grew by million  or 
the entire amount of increase came from the issuance of million in subordinated debentures on december    to fund the purchase of enterprise bancshares  inc  which is scheduled to close at the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of exclusive of this borrowing  the total assets of the corporation declined in by million  or 
the cash and cash equivalents account on the balance sheet reflected these borrowings  as the balance increased from million at the end of to million at the end of this change represents a million  or  increase 
without the borrowing  the cash and cash equivalents would have decreased for the year by million  or  which reflects management s effort to reduce cash balances and keep the money invested in higher yielding assets 
the investment securities portfolio declined during from million to million 
this represented a decrease of million  or 
the cash generated from the sales  maturities and payments of securities was reinvested into loans 
the loan portfolio increased during by million  or  from million to million 
the low interest rate environment over the last three years has had a significant impact on the loan portfolio 
it has affected both the growth and the mix of the portfolio 
also  the softness in the overall economy in the corporation s market has caused loan demand to be weak  especially in the business sector  as companies have chosen not to expand and in many cases have used cash flow to reduce debt 
this environment resulted in no growth in our business loan sector during the two most significant changes in the portfolio during came in the areas of consumer loans and loans secured by real estate 
in the area of consumer loans  the softness in the economy  the very low  or in the case of the auto industry  the continuation of zero rate loans  and the sale of student loans resulted in an overall decline in the consumer loan portfolio of approximately 
in the area of real estate loans  the mortgage refinancing trend continued through the first half of  and as a result  the corporation s adjustable rate mortgage portfolio declined by approximately million  or 
to offset the continued decline in the loan portfolio  the corporation purchased approximately million of mortgage loans in the secondary market during the second and third quarters  of which million remained on the corporation s balance sheet at year end 
this lack of loan demand resulting from the lack of growth in the primary market was one of the reasons for the corporation s decision to purchase enterprise  which is located in the fast growing east memphis market 
during  the allowance for loan losses increased by  or  from million to million 
even though there has been increased competition for good quality credits in its markets  the corporation did not reduce its underwriting standard and as a result  the quality of the portfolio remains strong 
net charge offs for and were 
and 
of average net loans outstanding for each year  respectively 
see note d in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the transactions in the reserve for loan losses for the three year period ended december  at december   non performing loans totaled only 
of total loans  and classified assets were only of capital 
this is a 
table of contents significant improvement from year end  when non performing loans totaled 
of total loans  and classified assets were of capital 
the reserve for loan losses as a percentage of total loans remained unchanged at of total loans at the end of and based on the evaluations described earlier in this document and the information above  the reserve amounts maintained at the end of and were deemed adequate to cover exposure within the corporation s loan portfolio 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  due to low loan demand and the heavy cash flows coming from prepayments of the mortgage backed securities portfolio  the corporation decided not to aggressively price deposits 
this decision resulted in a million decline in deposits and a million dollar decline in securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
also  during the year  the corporation paid down its advances from the federal home loan bank by approximately million 
the only significant increase in the corporation s liabilities during the year came from the issuance of million in subordinated debentures 
as previously mentioned  the debentures were issued to partially fund the acquisition of enterprise bancshares  inc in december  the corporation formed a special purpose entity named nbc capital corporation ms statutory trust i for the sole purpose of issuing trust preferred securities 
to fund this trust  the corporation issued  in subordinated debentures 
the trust then sold million in trust preferred securities to an institutional investor to pay for the debentures it purchased from the corporation 
the terms of the trust preferred securities and the subordinated debentures are the same 
each has a thirty year maturity and is callable  in whole or in part  at any interest payment date after five years 
the interest rate floats based on day libor and adjusts on a quarterly basis 
interest is payable quarterly 
the rate for the quarter ending march  is 
capital the corporation has historically been well capitalized in comparison to its peers 
the capital to asset ratio declined slightly in from to 
the peer banks are traditionally in the to range 
this relatively high level of capital makes it very difficult for the corporation to produce a competitive return on average equity 
in  shareholders equity remained unchanged at million 
during  the corporation generated net income of million  from which it declared approximately million in dividends 
also during the year  the interest rate climate changed  as long term rates increased  causing the market value of the available for sale securities to decrease 
as a result  accumulated other comprehensive income changed from an unrealized gain of  at december  to an unrealized loss of  at december  this million loss in value  along with the million in dividends  offset the added to equity by the net income 
during  the amount of treasury stock increased from  to  as the number of shares held in the treasury increased from  to  this increase in the shares held in treasury stock came from stock purchased through the repurchase program first announced in july of and extended in july of the initial plan approved the repurchase of up to  shares or up to of the common stock 
during   shares were purchased under this program for approximately  or an average of per share 
during the fourth quarter of  no shares were purchased under this plan 
also during  the corporation issued  shares upon the exercise of stock options 
at december   the corporation could purchase an additional  shares under its stock repurchase program 
during the year ended december   the corporation used ftn financial securities corp 
to purchase these shares under the stock repurchase plan in the open market in accordance with securities and exchange commission rule b current regulatory requirements call for a basic leverage ratio of for an institution to be considered well capitalized 
at the end of  nbc maintained a leverage ratio  which means it significantly exceeded the ratio required for a well capitalized institution 
regulatory authorities also evaluate a financial institution s capital under certain risk weighted formulas high risk assets would require a higher capital allotment  lower risk assets a lower capital allotment 
in this context  a well capitalized bank is required to have a tier risk based capital ratio excludes reserve for loan losses of and a total risk based capital ratio includes reserve for loan losses of 
at the end of  the corporation had a tier ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 

table of contents the corporation s capital position obviously exceeds regulatory requirements  even for well capitalized institutions 
management believes this level of capital to be excessive in relation to the amount needed to support the assets of the corporation 
with the purchase of enterprise  the capital of the corporation will be leveraged by the fact that approximately million in assets will be added with no additional capital 
management estimates that this addition of assets will bring the corporation s capital to asset ratio down from its current level of to approximately 
this is more in line with the corporation s peers 
liquidity  asset liability management liquidity may be defined as the ability of the corporation to meet cash flow requirements created by decreases in deposits and or other sources of funds or increases in loan demand 
the corporation has not experienced any problems with liquidity during  and anticipates that all liquidity requirements will be met comfortably in the future 
the corporation s traditional sources of funds from deposit increases  maturing loans and investments and earnings have generally allowed it to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its daily operational liquidity needs 
as the result of a million increase in loans and a million decrease in deposits  the corporation s loan deposit ratio has increased from in to in these changes in loans and deposits were funded by pay downs on and sales of investment securities of approximately million 
in addition  the corporation decreased its borrowings from the federal home loan bank during by approximately million and its securities sold under agreements to repurchase by million 
the reductions in these liabilities were partially funded by reducing federal funds sold by million 
all the remaining operational liquidity needs for the year were provided from normal operating activities the corporation offers repurchase agreements to accommodate excess funds of some of its larger depositors 
management believes that these repurchase agreements stabilize traditional deposit sources as opposed to risking the potential loss of these funds to alternative investment arrangements 
repurchase agreements  which are viewed as a source of funds to the corporation  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the level of repurchase agreement activity is limited by the availability of investment portfolio securities to be pledged against the accounts 
due to the limited amount of repurchase agreements and the fact that the underlying securities remain under the control of national bank of commerce  the exposure of the corporation for this service is not considered material 
on december   the corporation issued million in subordinated debt to partially fund the acquisition of enterprise bancshares  inc this will be an all cash transaction and will require approximately million 
the remaining portion of the purchase price will come from a special dividend from the corporation s subsidiary bank  national bank of commerce 
during the fourth quarter  the bank received approval from the comptroller of the currency  its primary regulator  to pay a special dividend of up to million to the corporation to help fund this acquisition 
the bank plans to obtain the cash by borrowing under its line at the federal home loan bank 
the following table shows the contractual obligations for the corporation as of december  obligations in thousands total due in less than year due in years due in years due after years long term debt operating leases securities sold under repurchase agreements other borrowings total cash obligations 
table of contents the following table shows the other commercial commitments for the corporation as of december  commercial commitments in thousands total expires in less than year expires in years expires in years expires after years lines of credit unfunded commitments standby letters of credit the corporation believes that normal earnings and other traditional sources of cash flow  along with additional borrowings from the federal home loan bank  if necessary  will provide the cash to allow it to meet these obligations with no adverse effect on liquidity 
at december   the corporation had the ability to borrow approximately million from the federal home loan bank and had other short term borrowing lines federal funds purchased lines of approximately million from upstream correspondent banks 
the corporation has no plans for the refinancing or redemption of any liabilities other than normal maturities and payments relating to the borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
the corporation does not have plans at this time for any discretionary spending that would have a material impact on liquidity other than the purchase of enterprise and its announced stock repurchase program 
at december   the corporation had the authority  at its discretion  to purchase  additional shares of its common stock 
if purchased at the year end closing price of  this purchase would require approximately million 
any purchases under this program will be made over an unknown period of time  and the necessary funds will be provided from normal sources 
under regulations controlling financial holding companies and national banks  the bank is limited in the amount it can lend to the corporation and such loans are required to be on a fully secured basis 
at december   there were no borrowings between the corporation and its subsidiary bank 
the corporation has maintained a consistent and disciplined asset liability management policy during this policy focuses on interest rate risk and sensitivity 
during  the corporation did not engage in any non exchange traded contracts such as currency or interest rate swaps  nor did it purchase or hold any derivative securities 
the primary objective of rate sensitivity management is to maintain net interest income growth while reducing exposure to adverse fluctuations in rates 
the corporation utilizes an asset liability management committee that evaluates and analyzes the corporation s pricing  asset liability maturities and growth  and balance sheet mix strategies in an effort to make informed decisions that will increase income and limit interest rate risk 
the committee uses simulation modeling as a guide for its decision making 
modeling techniques are also utilized to forecast changes in net income and the economic value of equity under assumed fluctuations in interest rate levels 
due to the potential volatility of interest rates  the corporation s goal is to stabilize the net interest margin by maintaining a neutral rate sensitive position 
at year end  the corporation s balance sheet reflected approximately million more in rate sensitive assets than liabilities that were scheduled to reprice within one year 
this represents of total assets and would indicate that the corporation is asset sensitive 
this computation results from a static gap analysis that weights assets and liabilities equally 
it is the corporation s policy to maintain a static gap position of no more than a plus or minus of aggregate assets over a moving twenty four month period 
the corporation s position is considered essentially neutral when using simulation modeling that provides different weighting for assets and liabilities 
management believes that interest rates will increase slightly during the second half of as a result  it is felt that the corporation s current position places it in the correct interest rate risk posture for a rising rate environment 
management does not believe that it is in the corporation s best interest to speculate on changes in interest rate levels 
although earnings could be enhanced if predictions were correct  they could also be put at significant risk if interest rates move against predictions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company does not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than collateralized mortgage obligations  which are commonly held securities generally collateralized by pools of gnma  fnma  or fhlmc pass through securities 
finally  the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  and other market risks 
the following table reflects the year end position of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which can either  reprice or mature within the designated time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps can vary from day to day and are not necessarily a reflection of the future 
in addition  certain assets and liabilities within the same designated time period may nonetheless reprice at different times and at different levels 

table of contents in thousands december  interest sensitive within cumulative within months within months within years total of interest earning assets interest earning assets loans investment and mortgage backed securities federal funds sold and other totals interest bearing liabilities deposits borrowed funds sensitivity gap dollar amount percent of total interest earning assets the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to mature or reprice within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing within a specific time frame exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing within that same time frame 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the costs of its liabilities and thus an increase in the institution s net interest income would result whereas an institution with a negative gap could experience the opposite results 
at december   total interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year were more than interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same time period by approximately million cumulative  representing a positive cumulative one year gap of of earning assets 
management of the company believes this position to be acceptable in the current interest rate environment 
banking regulators have issued advisories concerning the management of interest rate risk irr 
the regulators consider that effective interest rate management is an essential component of safe and sound banking practices 
to monitor its irr  the company s risk management practices include a risk management  b risk monitoring and c risk control 
risk management consists of a system in which a measurement is taken of the amount of earnings at risk when interest rates change 
the company does this by first preparing a base 
table of contents strategy which is the position of the bank and its forecasted earnings based upon the current interest rate environment or  most likely  interest rate environment 
the irr is then measured based upon hypothetical changes in interest rates by measuring the impact such a change will have on the base strategy 
risk monitoring consists of evaluating the base strategy and the assumptions used in its development based upon the current interest rate environment 
this evaluation is performed quarterly by management or more often in a rapidly changing interest rate situation and monitored by an asset liability management committee 
risk control is utilized based upon the setting of guidelines as to the tolerance for interest rate exposure 
these guidelines are set by senior management and approved by the board of directors 
assuming a basis points increase over the next twelve months  the december  model reflects net income declining by 
a basis points decline would result in a decrease in net income 
utilizing a rate shock model  a basis point increase in interest rates results in a decrease in market value equity  and a basis point decrease results in a increase in market value equity 
the guidelines allow for no more than a change in income  and no more than a change in market value equity 
however  at december   management believes the changes in income and market value equity as reflected in the models are acceptable in the current rate environment
