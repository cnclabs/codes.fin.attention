overview we are an applied genomics company that develops and commercializes proprietary dna based tests for the early detection of cancer 
our first commercial test  pregen plus  is used for screening colorectal cancer  the second leading cause of cancer death in the us and the leading cause of cancer death among non smokers 
since our inception on february   our principal activities have included researching and developing our technologies for colorectal cancer screening  conducting clinical studies to validate our colorectal cancer screening tests  negotiating licenses for intellectual property of others  developing relationships with opinion leaders in the scientific and medical communities  conducting market studies and analyzing alternative approaches for commercializing our technologies  hiring research and clinical personnel  hiring management and other support personnel  hiring sales personnel raising capital  licensing our proprietary technologies to labcorp  and working with labcorp on activities necessary for commercial launch and marketing of pregen plus 
on june   we entered into a license agreement and long term strategic alliance with labcorp to commercialize pregen plus 
pursuant to the license agreement  we agreed to license to labcorp all us and canadian patents and patent applications owned or exclusively licensed by us relating to pregen plus 
the license with labcorp is exclusive in the us and canada for a five year period followed by a non exclusive license for the life of the patents 
in return for the license  labcorp has agreed to pay us certain up front and milestone payments  and a per test royalty fee based on the reimbursed amount of each test ordered by a physician and processed in labcorp s facilities 
these per test royalty fees are subject to a minimum dollar amount per test 
labcorp made an initial payment of million to us upon the signing of the agreement in june  and a second payment of million in august upon the commercial launch of pregen plus 
as part of the agreement  we issued to labcorp a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock  exercisable for cash over a three year period  at an exercise price of per share 
on august   labcorp commercially launched the pregen plus test for the detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk  asymptomatic population 
as a result  our principal activities are now focused on implementing marketing and sales initiatives in conjunction with labcorp to support the on going commercialization of pregen plus as well as focusing on various research and development initiatives aimed at further optimization of the test 
since the signing of our license agreement with labcorp in june  we have been actively working with labcorp to improve the performance characteristics of pregen plus and its market acceptance through the incorporation of technical changes such as effipure 
in addition  the august commercial launch of pregen plus enabled us and labcorp to refocus our efforts on new sales and marketing initiatives to help stimulate demand for the test 
we and labcorp amended this license agreement on january  to  among other things  restructure certain product development milestones and increase the level of our collaboration on sales initiatives and test enhancements 
this amendment eliminated certain product development milestones and added the aggregate payments associated with those milestones to the amounts we are eligible to receive upon the achievement of certain significant labcorp revenue thresholds as originally contemplated in the agreement 
pursuant to the amended agreement  we may be eligible for additional milestone payments from labcorp totaling up to million  of which a total of up to million relates to certain clinical guideline acceptance and policy level reimbursement approvals and a total of up to million relates to the achievement of significant labcorp revenue thresholds 
additionally  the amendment clarified the obligations of each party with respect to certain third party technology which has been incorporated into the commercial version of the pregen plus test  and also modified labcorp s five year exclusive license period which now begins effective august   the commercial launch date of pregen plus 
we have generated no material operating revenues since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have historically resulted from costs incurred in conjunction with our research and development initiatives  and more recently  costs associated with selling  general and administrative expenses as we hire additional personnel  initiate marketing programs and build our infrastructure to support the commercial launch and marketing of pregen plus 
research and development expenses include costs related to scientific and laboratory personnel  clinical studies and reagents and supplies used in the development of our technologies 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease in from levels due to the completion of one of our two large clinical trials that have comprise the majority of our research and development expense for the past two years 
in addition to the costs already incurred  our estimated cost to complete the mayo clinic trial is approximately million to million depending on the ultimate number of patients recruited and the final number of stool samples processed 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non research personnel salaries  office expenses and professional fees 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in from levels as we expect marketing program spend  primarily associated with pre commercialization activities  to decline in  but will be offset by an increase in selling expense associated with the development of our strategic sales team as we focus our attention on joint sales initiatives of pregen plus with labcorp 
stock based compensation expense  a non cash expense  primarily represents the difference between the exercise price and fair value of common stock on the date of grant for certain options granted prior to our initial public offering 
the stock based compensation expense is being amortized on an accelerated method over the vesting period of the applicable options  which is generally months 
currently  we expect to recognize stock based compensation expense related to employee  consultant and director options of approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
significant accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was recently issued by the securities and exchange commission  requires all registrants to discuss critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
further  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and actual results may differ from those estimates 
the areas that require the greatest degree of management judgment are the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets  primarily intellectual property and the accrual of costs related to patient recruitment for our multi center clinical study 
patent costs  which consist of related legal fees and disbursements and purchases of intellectual property  are capitalized as incurred and are amortized beginning when patents are issued in the united states over an estimated useful life of five years 
capitalized patent costs are expensed upon disallowance of the patent  or upon a decision by us to no longer pursue the patent  or the related intellectual property is deemed to be no longer of value to us 
we accrued the estimated cost of patient recruitment associated with our large  patient multi center clinical study  which was initiated in the third quarter of  as patients were enrolled in the trial 
these costs consisted primarily of payments made to the clinical centers  investigators and patients for participating in the company s clinical study 
the company concluded its patient recruitment for the clinical study at the end of the first quarter of and essentially all patient recruitment costs have been paid 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed in july and june with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the respective license periods 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  product cost of revenues includes the product costs of effipure components sold to labcorp as well as the estimated cost of performing commercial colorectal screening tests at our facilities while product royalty cost of revenues represents royalties owed to third parties for technology currently incorporated into pregen plus 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable with the completion of our  patient multi center clinical trial which was initiated in october and included a decrease of million in trials and studies expenses partially offset by increases of  in personnel related expenses   in professional fees and expenses   in laboratory expenses  and  related to the leasing of additional laboratory space 
the increase in the expenses noted above were primarily attributable to an increase in the number of tests being performed in support of our multi center clinical study and the mayo clinic study  in addition to other research and development initiatives undertaken to further develop our technologies in support of the commercial launch of pregen plus 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to increases in sales personnel and marketing programs in support of the commercial launch of pregen plus and included increases of million in personnel related expenses  million in professional fees and expenses   in travel related expenses and  related to office space and related office expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  a non cash expense  decreased to million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and  related to general and administrative personnel from million for the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation in from is due to the accelerated method of amortization being used to record this expense 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments and overall decreases in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenue 
revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this revenue is primarily composed of amortization of up front technology license fees associated with agreements signed in july and june with labcorp that are being amortized on a straight line basis over the respective license periods 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  of  represents the estimated cost of performing colorectal screening tests at our facility 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the initiation of our  patient multi center clinical trial in october and included increases of million in personnel related expenses  million in laboratory expenses  million in trials and studies expenses and million related to the leasing of additional laboratory space 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding departmental allocations of stock based compensation  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable primarily to additional personnel hired to build our infrastructure and the initiation of other corporate and marketing programs to support future growth and included increases of  in personnel related expenses   in professional fees and expenses   in travel related expenses partially offset by lower costs of  related to office space and related office expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation  a non cash expense  decreased to million for the year ended december   of which  related to research and development personnel and million related to general and administrative personnel from million for the year ended december  the decrease in stock based compensation in from is due to the accelerated method of amortization being used to record this expense 
interest income 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments and overall decreases in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private sales of preferred stock  our initial public offering of common stock in february and cash received from labcorp in connection with our strategic alliance 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available to fund our operations 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   million in and million in excluding the impact of the upfront deferred licensing fee of million from labcorp  net cash used in operating activities would have been million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to our increase in operating losses resulting from higher spending in research and development expenses as the we commenced our  patient multi center clinical trial in october in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as we initiated certain corporate  selling and marketing programs to support the commercial launch of pregen plus 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased during the year ended december  due to the timing of payments primarily associated with the multi center trial which successfully concluded during net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  while investing activities used million in and million in excluding the impact of the purchases and sales of marketable securities  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   million in and million in cash used for purchasing property and equipment was million for the year ended december   million in and million in this investment in property and equipment for was attributable to our relocation of our corporate headquarters and lab operations to marlborough massachusetts while the investment in and was primarily the result of the expansion of our laboratory operations to prepare for our multi center clinical trial and the mayo clinic trial 
cash used for the expansion of intellectual property portfolio was  for the year ended december    in and million in we also capitalized  of costs associated with its recent shelf filing for the year ended december  the investment for includes the purchase of intellectual property from mt technologies relating to its effipure technology  formerly known as hybrigel  which consisted of four issued patents and pending patent applications for million in cash 
patent costs  which historically consisted of related legal fees  are capitalized as incurred 
we purchased marketable securities of million during utilizing a portion of the million received from labcorp in august upon commercialization of pregen plus 
for the year ended december   million of marketable securities matured and were then re invested in cash and cash equivalents or used to fund operations 
for the year ended december   we purchased marketable securities of million as we began to invest in longer term securities in order to increase the return on our excess cash position consistent with our investment policy guidelines 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december    in and million in cash provided by financing for the year ended december  resulted from the issuance of million of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans along with the repayment of  of stock subscription receivables 
cash provided by financing for the year ended december  resulted from issuance of  of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans along with the repayment of  of stock subscription receivables 
cash provided by financing for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the sale of our common stock from our initial public offering in we expect that cash  cash equivalents and short term investments currently on hand at december   will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve to fifteen months 
we expect that payments from labcorp under our strategic partnership agreement  when and if ultimately earned and paid  will supplement our liquidity position 
these payments primarily take the form of royalty payments and milestone payments 
as we are in the early stage of commercialization of pregen plus  we cannot forecast how rapidly sales of pregen plus and  consequently  royalty payments from labcorp  will increase  if at all 
further  the timing of milestone payments is similarly unpredictable at this time 
of the remaining million of payments for which we may be eligible under our amended agreement with labcorp  million relates to milestone payments associated with the inclusion of pregen plus into certain clinical guideline acceptance and policy level reimbursement approvals that  in large part  depend upon decisions to be made by third parties and million relates to the achievement of certain significant labcorp revenue thresholds that depend upon labcorp s success with respect to its sales of pregen plus and are not expected for the next several years  if at all 
as such  no assurance can be given that any payments pursuant to our agreement with labcorp will be sufficient or timely enough to meet our liquidity needs 
if payments from labcorp are insufficient to meet our liquidity needs  we will be required to raise additional capital or reduce the scale of our operations 
on september   our shelf registration statement on form s filed with the sec was declared effective which permits us to offer  from time to time  any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase each of the foregoing  up to an aggregate of million 
on january   we filed a prospectus supplement pursuant to this shelf registration statement relating to an offering shares of our common stock 
while we believe that we will be able to raise sufficient funds in this offering to provide additional liquidity for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our capital raising efforts  or that we will be able raise the funds at an acceptable price level 
with an effective shelf registration in place  we believe we are in a position to be able to maintain and maximize our financial flexibility for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs  supporting our research and clinical study efforts and our sales and marketing efforts associated with the commercialization of pregen plus  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of laboratory equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property estate 
as of december   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments year ending december  operating leases contractual obligations purchase commitments total thereafter    total payment obligations     our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our clinical studies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  the successful commercialization of pre gen plus  and the success of any proposed financing efforts 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not utilized 
the internal revenue code and applicable state laws impose substantial restrictions on a corporation s utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards if an ownership change is deemed to have occurred 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have a history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income within the next two years in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation against our deferred tax assets based on our history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for us to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of tax benefit and a reduction to our effective tax rate 
factors that may affect future results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
this discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
these are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  which we currently deem immaterial or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and operating results would likely suffer 
we may never successfully commercialize any of our products or services or become profitable 
we have incurred losses since we were formed 
from our date of inception on february  through december   we have accumulated a total deficit of approximately million 
we expect that our losses will continue for the next several years as a result of continuing research and development expenses  as well as increased sales and marketing expenses 
we cannot assure you that the revenue from any of our products or services will be sufficient to make us profitable 
our ability to generate revenue substantially depends on the success of our strategic relationship with labcorp 
we have a long term  strategic alliance with labcorp  under which we licensed to labcorp certain of our technologies that are required for the commercialization of pregen plus  a proprietary  non invasive dna based screening test for the early detection of colorectal cancer in the average risk population 
the license to labcorp is exclusive within the united states and canada for a five year term followed by a non exclusive license for the life of the underlying patents 
labcorp has the ability to terminate this agreement for  among other things  a material breach by us 
if labcorp were to terminate the agreement  or fail to meet its obligations under the agreement  our revenues would be materially adversely affected and the commercialization of pregen plus would be interrupted 
further  we cannot guarantee that we would be able to enter into a similar agreement to commercialize this technology 
moreover  if we do not achieve certain milestones  or labcorp does not achieve certain revenue and performance thresholds within the time periods prescribed in the agreement  we may not fully realize the expected benefits of the agreement to us 
in january  we and labcorp amended our license agreement  to among other things  restructure certain product development milestones and increase the level of our collaboration on sales and product enhancement initiatives 
although this amendment does not change the million total milestone payments that we are eligible to receive under the agreement  the amendment may delay or make it more difficult for us to fully realize these payments if labcorp is unable to achieve significant revenue thresholds with respect to its sales of pregen plus or we are unable to obtain clinical guideline acceptance and policy level reimbursement approvals for pregen plus 
if we do not receive additional milestone payments under our agreement with labcorp  we may be required to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of pregen plus or other technologies 
moreover  we cannot assure you that this amendment will accomplish the long term goals of either party 
if one or more additional amendments to our agreement with labcorp become necessary as a result of the continuing evolution of pregen plus  developments in our relationship with labcorp or otherwise  we cannot assure you that any such amendment could be entered into on more favorable terms  if at all 
if we and labcorp are unsuccessful in managing our strategic relationship  we would be required to enter into other strategic relationships for the commercialization of pregen plus or commercialize the test ourselves 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to license our technology to another commercial laboratory or otherwise successfully commercialize the technology  and our failure to do either of the foregoing would materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues 
because our revenue will be substantially dependent upon labcorp s commercial sales of pregen plus  we are actively working together with labcorp on initiatives designed to promote our joint success with regard to pregen plus 
such initiatives include the following test validation  technology transfer and licensing  contracting with manufacturers and suppliers  physician education and demand  broad based reimbursement initiatives  advocacy development  and sales force training 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts with respect to one or more of the foregoing initiatives  our revenues could be materially adversely affected 
our business would suffer if we are unable to license certain technologies or obtain raw materials or if certain of our licenses were terminated 
the current configuration of pregen plus that we have commercialized with labcorp requires access to certain technologies and supply of raw materials for which we  or labcorp  have entered into certain licensing and supply agreements 
while we believe that we  or labcorp  entered into agreements for such technologies and raw materials on favorable terms and conditions  no assurances can be given that we  or labcorp  will be able to maintain these relationships 
furthermore  the configuration of pregen plus may require us  or labcorp to enter into additional licenses with third parties for other technologies and raw materials  and there can be no assurance that we  or labcorp  can obtain these technologies and raw materials on acceptable terms  or at all 
any such additional licenses may require us to pay royalties or other fees to third parties  which would have an adverse effect on our revenues or gross margin 
while we believe such third parties will meet their contractual responsibilities under current and future agreements  there can be no assurance that this will be the case or that such future agreements will in fact be negotiated and entered into 
there can be no assurance that any of our current contractual arrangements between us and third parties  us and labcorp  or between our strategic partners and other third parties  will be continued  entered into  or not breached or terminated early  or that we or our strategic partners will be able to enter into any future relationships necessary to the commercial sale of pregen plus or necessary to our realization of material revenues 
this could require the pregen plus test to be re configured which could negatively impact its commercial sale and increase the costs associated with the pregen plus test  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and gross margin  respectively 
if our clinical studies do not prove the superiority of pregen plus  we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of physicians to order  and third party payors to pay for tests based on pregen plus 
in the first quarter of  we concluded patient enrollment in a multi center clinical study of our pregen plus technology that included approximately  asymptomatic  average risk aged and older patients from over academic and community based medical practices 
the goal of this clinical study was to provide additional data supporting the superiority of tests utilizing our technology versus the most widely used brand of fobt  hemoccult ii  in detecting colorectal cancer in this average risk population 
although this study achieved its primary endpoint of showing that our original  bead based version of pregen plus was four times more sensitive than hemoccult ii  the point sensitivity from our multi center clinical study was lower than that seen in our previous research and clinical studies 
accordingly  despite the success of this study  we and labcorp may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of third party payors to pay for tests using our technologies which could slow the demand for the pregen plus test and adversely and materially impact revenues and profitability and  as a result  we may experience a decrease in our stock price 
in october  we signed a clinical trial agreement with mayo clinic in which the bead based version of our pregen plus test was made the subject of an independent study by mayo clinic  for which mayo clinic received a million grant from the national cancer institute of the national institutes of health 
this three year study is expected to include approximately  patients at average risk for developing colorectal cancer and  similar to our multi center clinical study  is designed to compare the results of our bead based technologies with those of the hemoccult ii and hemoccult sensa  two brands of fobt  common first line colorectal cancer screening options 
the results of the mayo clinical study may not show that tests using our technologies are sufficiently superior to hemoccult ii and hemoccult sensa 
in that event  we may experience reluctance or refusal on the part of physicians to order  and third party payors to pay for tests using our technologies  which could slow the demand for  and successful commercialization of  the pregen plus test 
if medicare and other third party payors  including managed care organizations  do not provide adequate reimbursement for pregen plus  the commercial success of pregen plus could be compromised 
many physicians may decide not to order colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies unless the tests are adequately reimbursed by third party payors such as medicare and covered by managed care organizations 
there is significant uncertainty concerning third party reimbursement for the use of any test incorporating new technology 
reimbursement by a third party payor may depend on a number of factors  including a payor s determination that tests using our technologies are sensitive for colorectal cancer  not experimental or investigational  medically necessary  appropriate for the specific patient  and are cost effective 
while we and labcorp have had some success in obtaining reimbursement from third party payors for tests performed  to date  labcorp has not secured any broad based policy level reimbursement approval from medicare or enough third party payors to ensure the long term commercial success of pregen plus 
reimbursement by medicare will require a review that may be lengthy and which may be performed under the provisions of a national coverage decision process 
the federal balanced budget act of provides for adding new technologies to the colorectal cancer screening benefit  such as ours  with such frequency and payment limits as the secretary of health and human services  or hhs  determines appropriate 
we cannot guarantee that the secretary of hhs will act to approve tests based on our technologies on a timely basis  or at all 
since policy level reimbursement approval is required from each private payor individually  seeking such approvals is a time consuming and costly process 
if we  or labcorp  are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement approval from medicare and private payors for pregen plus as a benefit  or if the amount reimbursed is inadequate  our ability to generate revenue from our pregen plus tests will be limited 
if our effipure technology and our or labcorp s other technological advancements do not increase the performance of the pregen plus test  the demand for pregen plus may be negatively impacted 
we continue to work to improve the performance characteristics of pregen plus through technical innovations such as our effipure technology 
however  there can be no assurance that future generations of our pregen plus test  or the commercial version of the pregen plus test currently offered by labcorp  which incorporates effipure and other technology improvements  will have significantly greater sensitivity that that of our original bead based technology that was used in the multi center study 
we have conducted studies of the commercial version of pregen plus  which includes our effipure technology 
these studies  which have consisted of cohorts from previously conducted clinical studies  including the multi center study  have shown that the commercial version of the pregen plus test  which includes effipure  detected cancer in additional samples that the original bead based pregen plus version did not 
although this ability of the commercial version of pregen plus to detect previously missed cancers has been a consistent outcome across all of our internal studies  the number of samples in each of these studies has been small and the ranges of sensitivity improvement with effipure have been broad  thus making it difficult to definitively quantify the increase in sensitivity of the commercial test as compared to the original bead based test 
if future generations of our pregen plus test  or the commercial version of the pregen plus test  with effipure  does not have significantly greater sensitivity than that of the original bead based technology  we may never achieve the expected demand for tests using our technologies or such demand could be significantly reduced  either of which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
the long term commercial success of pregen plus may be jeopardized if we  or labcorp  are not able to lower costs through automating and simplifying key operational processes 
currently  colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies are more expensive than fobt because they are labor intensive and use highly complex processes and expensive reagents 
in order to make our technologies less costly and more commercially attractive  we or labcorp will need to reduce the costs of tests using our technologies through significant automation of key operational processes and other cost savings procedures 
if we or labcorp fail to create and improve technologies that sufficiently reduce costs  labcorp s sales of pregen plus and  as a result  our revenues may be limited 
if we are unable to convince medical practitioners to order tests using our technologies  our revenue and profitability may be limited 
if we  or labcorp  fail to convince medical practitioners to order tests using our technologies  we will not be able to create sufficient demand for tests using our technologies in sufficient volume for us to become profitable 
we and labcorp will need to make thought leading gastroenterologists and primary care physicians aware of the benefits of tests using our technologies through published papers  presentations at scientific conferences  favorable results from our clinical studies and obtaining reimbursement from insurers 
our failure to be successful in these efforts would make it difficult for us  or labcorp  to convince medical practitioners to order colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies for their patients which could materially adversely affect our revenues 
if pregen plus is not included in colorectal cancer screening guidelines  physicians may not order pregen plus and payors may not authorize reimbursement for pregen plus 
an important element to market acceptance of pregen plus and the test s successful commercialization involves the inclusion of pregen plus in colorectal cancer screening guidelines 
guideline inclusion is in large part dependent upon the data from our multi center study being accepted by  and published in  peer reviewed journals 
there can be no assurance that a peer reviewed journal will accept or publish our multi center study data  nor can there be any assurance that pregen plus will be included within colorectal cancer screening guidelines any time soon  if at all 
in the event pregen plus is not included within colorectal cancer screening guidelines  our revenues  profits and results of operations would likely be materially and negatively affected 
we may experience limits on our revenue and profitability if only a small number of people decide to be screened for colorectal cancer using our technologies 
even if our technologies are superior to alternative colorectal cancer screening technologies  adequate third party reimbursement is obtained and medical practitioners order tests using our technologies  only a small number of people may decide to be screened for colorectal cancer 
despite the availability of current colorectal cancer screening methods as well as the recommendations of the american cancer society that all americans over the age of be screened for colorectal cancer  most of these individuals decide not to complete a colorectal cancer screening test 
if only a small portion of the population decides to utilize colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies  we will  despite our efforts  experience limits on our revenue and profitability 
if we or our partners fail to comply with fda requirements  we may be limited or restricted in our ability to market our products and services and may be subject to stringent penalties 
the fda does not actively regulate laboratory tests that are developed and used by a laboratory to conduct in house testing 
the fda does regulate specific reagents and certain components  some of which are used with our technologies and react with a biological substance including those designed to identify a specific dna sequence or protein 
for instance  a key component of our technologies includes our effipure technology for the recovery of dna from biological samples 
the fda s regulations provide that most such reagents  which the fda refers to as analyte specific reagents  or asrs  are exempt from the fda s pre market review requirements 
we believe that asrs that we provide currently fall within these exemptions 
however  if the fda were to decide to more actively regulate in house developed laboratory tests  or significantly change the regulations for asrs  commercial sales of pregen plus and the sale of effipure components to labcorp could be delayed  halted or prevented 
if the fda were to view any of our or labcorp s actions as non compliant  it could initiate enforcement action  which could involve criminal or civil penalties 
moreover  while we believe that effipure qualifies as an analyte specific reagent  and is therefore exempt from the fda s pre market review requirements  there can be no assurance that the fda or other regulatory bodies will agree with our assessment and the commercialization of our products and services could be impacted by being delayed  halted or prevented altogether 
finally  any asrs that we provide will be subject to a number of fda requirements  including compliance with the fda s quality system regulation  which establishes extensive regulations for quality assurance and control as well as manufacturing procedures 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in enforcement action for us  our partners  or our contract manufacturers 
adverse fda action in any of these areas could significantly increase our expenses and limit our revenue and profitability 
we may be subject to substantial costs and liability or be prevented from selling our screening tests for cancer as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent rights 
third parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our licensors  our licensees  our suppliers  our strategic partners  or us 
we pursue a patent strategy that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in the early detection of colorectal cancer and is designed to maximize our patent protection against third parties in the us and in foreign countries 
we have filed patent applications that cover methods we have designed to detect colorectal cancer and other cancers  including our testing process 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may have to initiate actions against third parties 
any actions regarding patents could be costly and time consuming  and divert our management and key personnel from our business 
additionally  such actions could result in challenges to the validity or applicability of our patents 
because the us patent trademark office maintains patent applications in secrecy until a patent application publishes or the patent is issued  others may have filed patent applications covering technology used by us or our partners 
additionally  there may be third party patents  patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our technologies that may block or compete with our technologies 
even if third party claims are without merit  defending a lawsuit may result in substantial expense to us and may divert the attention of management and key personnel 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that we would prevail in any of these suits or that the damages or other remedies  if any  awarded against us would not be substantial 
claims of intellectual property infringement may require that we  or our strategic partners  enter into royalty or license agreements with third parties that may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
these claims may also result in injunctions against the further development and commercial sale of pregen plus  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  patents and applications owned by us may become the subject of interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us  as well as a possible adverse decision as to the priority of invention of the patent or patent application involved 
an adverse decision in an interference proceeding may result in the loss of rights under a patent or patent application subject to such a proceeding 
additionally  a third party has asserted claims of patent infringement against certain entities that are anticipated suppliers of materials necessary to the pregen plus test as it is currently configured 
although to date no legal proceedings have been initiated against us  if any third party  including the third party discussed above  is successful in challenging the supply of materials needed for the pregen plus test as it is currently configured  commercialization of our technologies may be significantly delayed  sales of the pregen plus test may become interrupted  and our revenue may become impacted 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property effectively  we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property  which would impair our competitive advantage 
we rely on patent protection as well as a combination of trademark  copyright and trade secret protection  and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies  all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  we will be unable to prevent third parties from using our technologies and they will be able to compete more effectively against us 
as of december   we have issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and we also have issued foreign patents and pending foreign patent applications 
we cannot assure you that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in issued patents  and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be issued 
further  we cannot assure you that other parties will not challenge any patents issued to us  or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid or enforceable 
a third party institution is a co owner of one of our issued patents relating to pooling patient samples in connection with our loss of heterozygosity detection method 
we cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in defending challenges made in connection with our patents and patent applications 
any successful third party challenge to our patents could result in co ownership of such patents with a third party or the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents 
in addition  we and a third party institution have filed a joint patent application that is co owned by us and that third party institution relating to the use of various dna markers  including one of our detection methods  to detect cancers of the lung  pancreas  esophagus  stomach  small intestine  bile duct  naso pharyngeal  liver and gall bladder in stool under the patent cooperation treaty 
this patent application designates the united states  japan  europe and canada 
co ownership of a patent allows the co owner to exercise all rights of ownership  including the right to use  transfer and license the rights protected by the applicable patent 
in addition to our patents  we rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
we require our employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements and employees to sign agreements assigning to us all intellectual property arising from their work for us 
nevertheless  we cannot guarantee that these measures will be effective in protecting our intellectual property rights 
we cannot guarantee that the patents issued to us will be broad enough to provide any meaningful protection nor can we assure you that one of our competitors may not develop more effective technologies  designs or methods to test for colorectal cancer or any other common cancer without infringing our intellectual property rights or that one of our competitors might not design around our proprietary technologies 
if we become subject to additional regulations from the us department of transportation  or other domestic and international regulatory agencies  for the transport of diagnostic specimens  it could increase the cost of transporting stool specimens and limit revenue growth 
on august   the us department of transportation  or dot  issued revised hazardous materials regulations for the packaging and transport of infectious materials  including diagnostic specimens 
in anticipation of the application of these regulations to our current specimen container and transport system  we submitted an exemption request to the dot to minimize the changes that would be necessary for our specimen collection system  while still providing an equivalent level of safety 
on february   the dot issued a formal determination that stool samples intended for clinical research or diagnostic purposes would not be deemed an infectious substance subject to the hazardous materials regulations 
while this decision is favorable  we cannot be certain that the dot  or other domestic and international regulatory agencies  will not more actively regulate or restrict the transportation of stool samples  such as those used in our diagnostic tests 
other companies may develop and market novel or improved methods for detecting colorectal cancer  which may make our technologies less competitive  or even obsolete 
the market for colorectal cancer screening is large  approximating million americans age and above  of which over million fail to follow the american cancer society s screening guidelines 
as a result  the colorectal screening market has attracted competitors  some of which have significantly greater resources than we have 
currently  we face competition from procedure based detection technologies such as flexible sigmoidoscopy  colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy  a new procedure being performed in which a radiologist views the inside of the colon through a scanner  as well as existing and possibly improved traditional screening tests such as immunochemical fobt 
in addition  some competitors are developing serum based tests  or screening tests based on the detection of proteins or nucleic acids produced by colon cancer in the blood 
these and other companies may also be working on additional methods of detecting colon cancer that have not yet been announced 
we may be unable to compete effectively against these competitors either because their test is superior or because they may have more expertise  experience  financial resources and stronger business relationships 
we rely on third party contract manufacturers and suppliers and may experience a scarcity of raw materials and components 
we rely on contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain components for our technologies 
we believe that there are relatively few manufacturers that are currently capable of supplying commercial quantities of the raw materials and components necessary for the current configuration of the pregen plus test  including our effipure technology 
although we have identified suppliers that we believe are capable of supplying these raw materials and components in sufficient quantity today  there can be no assurance that we  or labcorp  will be able to enter into agreements with such suppliers on a timely basis on acceptable terms  if at all 
furthermore  prior to august  pregen plus had never been offered on a commercial scale  and there can be no assurance that the raw materials and components necessary to meet demand will be available in sufficient quantities or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we  or labcorp  should encounter delays or difficulties in securing the necessary raw materials and components for pregen plus  we may need to reconfigure the pregen plus test which would result in delays in commercialization or an interruption in sales which could materially adversely impact our revenues 
the failure of labcorp or any other laboratory using pregen plus to comply with regulations governing clinical laboratories would materially adversely affect our business 
labcorp and any other laboratory that uses pregen plus is subject to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of  or clia 
clia is a federal law which regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis  prevention or treatment of disease 
clia is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the us by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality control  quality assurance and inspections 
if labcorp were to lose its clia certification  it may no longer be able to offer pregen plus  which would have a materially adverse effect on our business 
the loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business 
our success depends largely on the skills  experience and performance of key members of our senior management team  including don m 
hardison  our president and chief executive officer  john a 
mccarthy  jr  our executive vice president  chief financial officer and treasurer  and anthony p 
shuber  our executive vice president and chief technology officer 
anthony p 
shuber has been critical to the development of our technologies and business 
although messrs 
hardison  mccarthy and shuber have each signed a non disclosure and assignment of intellectual property agreement and a non compete agreement  they have no employment agreements currently in place 
we also have a severance agreement with each of messrs 
hardison  mccarthy and shuber that provides for twelve months severance under certain circumstances 
the efforts of each of these persons will be critical to us as we continue to develop our technologies and testing processes and as we transition to a company with commercialized products and services 
if we were to lose one or more of these key employees  we may experience difficulties in competing effectively  developing our technologies and implementing our business strategies 
if we lose the support of our key scientific collaborators  it may be difficult to establish tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening  which may limit our revenue growth and profitability 
we have established relationships with leading scientists  including members of our scientific advisory board  and research and academic institutions  such as mayo clinic and john hopkins university  that we believe are key to establishing tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening 
if our collaborators determine that colorectal cancer screening tests using our technologies are not superior to available colorectal cancer screening tests or that alternative technologies would be more effective in the early detection of colorectal cancer  we would encounter significant difficulty establishing tests using our technologies as a standard of care for colorectal cancer screening  which would limit our revenue growth and profitability 
our inability to apply our proprietary technologies successfully to detect other common cancers may limit our revenue growth and profitability 
while  to date  we have focused substantially all of our research and development efforts on colorectal cancer  we have used our technologies to detect cancers of the lung  pancreas  esophagus  stomach and gall bladder 
in the future  we intend to evaluate and potentially extend our technology platform to the development of screening tests for these common cancers 
to do so  we may need to overcome technological challenges to develop reliable screening tests for these cancers 
there can be no assurance that our technologies will be capable of reliably detecting cancers  beyond colorectal cancer  with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically and commercially useful for such other cancers  or that we can develop such technologies at all 
we may never realize any benefits from our research and development activities 
we may not have the ability to support demand 
the demand for the pregen plus test may require us and labcorp to implement certain increases in scale and related manufacturing and process improvements  and to establish an internal quality assurance program to support commercial testing 
no assurance can be given that these increases in scale  related improvements and quality assurance program will be successfully implemented  and failure to do so could result in higher cost of testing or an inability to meet market demand 
since pregen plus was recently introduced commercially in august  there can be no assurance that labcorp will be able to perform tests on a timely basis at a level consistent with demand 
if labcorp encounters difficulty meeting market demand for pregen plus  there could be substantial interruption in labcorp s continued ability to offer pregen plus commercially and our revenue could be materially and adversely affected 
changes in healthcare policy could subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of the pregen plus test and increase our costs 
healthcare policy has been a subject of extensive discussion in the executive and legislative branches of the federal and many state governments 
we developed our commercialization strategy for pregen plus based on existing healthcare policies 
changes in healthcare policy could substantially interrupt the sales of pregen plus  increase costs  and divert management s attention 
we cannot predict what changes  if any  will be proposed or adopted or the effect that such proposals or adoption may have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms in the future may limit our growth 
if our capital resources become insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operations 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may have to restrict our operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into agreements on unattractive terms 
further  to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
product liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and increases in our insurance rates 
the sale and use of our test could lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that one of our products contained a design or manufacturing defect which resulted in the failure to detect the disease for which it was designed 
a product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend  either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition 
we cannot assure you that our product liability insurance would protect our assets from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future 
our former independent public accountants  arthur andersen llp  were found guilty of federal obstruction of justice charges  and you are unlikely to be able to exercise effective remedies against it in any legal action 
prior to july   arthur andersen llp served as the company s independent auditors 
on march   arthur andersen was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron corporation and on june   arthur andersen was found guilty 
arthur andersen informed the sec that it would cease practicing before the sec by august   unless the sec determined that another date was appropriate 
on may   the company dismissed arthur andersen and retained ernst young llp as its independent auditors for its fiscal year ended december  sec rules require the company to present historical audited financial statements in various sec filings  such as registration statements  along with arthur andersen s consent to the company s inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report in those filings 
since the company s former engagement partner and audit manager have left arthur andersen and in light of the cessation of arthur andersen s sec practice  the company is not able to obtain the consent of arthur andersen to the inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report in the company s relevant current and future filings 
the sec has provided regulatory relief designed to allow companies that file reports with the sec to dispense with the requirement to file a consent of arthur andersen in certain circumstances  but purchasers of securities sold under the company s registration statements  which were not filed with the consent of arthur andersen to the inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report  will not be able to sue arthur andersen pursuant to section a of the securities act and therefore the purchasers right of recovery under that section may be limited as a result of the lack of the company s ability to obtain arthur andersen s consent 
certain provisions of our charter  by laws and delaware law may make it difficult for you to change our management and may also make a takeover difficult 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that limit the ability of stockholders to change our management and may also enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders and advance notice procedures required for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and cause us to take other corporate actions 
in addition  the existence of these provisions  together with delaware law  might hinder or delay an attempted takeover other than through negotiations with our board of directors 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely 
for example  between september  and december   the closing price of our common stock dropped from approximately to per share and from march  to july  the price of our common stock rose from to per share 
consequently  the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices and we may be unable to sustain or increase the value of an investment in our common stock 
factors affecting our stock price may include technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  clinical trial results relating to the pregen plus tests or those of our competitors  reimbursement decisions by medicare and other third party payors  fda regulation of our products and services  the establishment of collaborative partnerships  health care legislation  intellectual property disputes and other litigation  additions or departures of key personnel  the performance characteristics of our technologies  general market conditions  slow market acceptance of pregen plus  and sales of our common stock or debt securities 
because we are a company with no significant operating revenue  you may consider one of these factors to be material 
future sales by our existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock 
if our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
moreover  the perception in the public market that our existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating results may fluctuate  which may adversely affect our share price 
fluctuations in our operating results may lead to fluctuations  including declines  in our share price 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors  including demand by physicians and consumers for pregen plus  new technology introductions  reimbursement acceptance success  changes in our agreement with labcorp  the number and timing of milestones that we achieve under collaborative agreements  the level of our development activity conducted for  and our success in commercializing these developments  and the level of our spending on pregen plus commercialization efforts  licensing and acquisition initiatives  clinical studies  and internal research and development 
variations in the timing of our future revenue and expenses could also cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated earning shortfalls or losses 
in addition  the nasdaq national market in general  and the market for biotechnology companies in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies
