item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based upon current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors 
see the discussion in forward looking statements on page critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in the assumptions used to value these estimates  which are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and are the policies which are most critical in the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations long term contracts the company recognizes contract revenue in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the company records revenue on its cost type and time and material contracts based upon direct labor costs and other direct contract costs incurred 
the company has fixed price exit strategy contracts to remediate environmental conditions at contaminated sites under which the company and its customers are protected against cost overruns by insurance policies 
revenue and related costs from these fixed price contracts is recognized using the efforts expended  percentage of completion method of accounting based on total costs incurred to date as compared to total costs estimated at completion 
contract costs include direct labor costs  subcontractor costs  other direct costs and indirect costs 
the company s method of revenue recognition requires the company to prepare estimates of costs to complete for contracts in progress 
in making such estimates  judgments are required to evaluate contingencies  such as potential variances in schedule and labor and other contract costs  liability claims  contract disputes or achievement of contractual performance standards 
changes in total estimated contract costs and losses  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
allowances for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated potential losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts have been determined through reviews of specific amounts deemed to be uncollectible  potential write offs as a result of customers who have filed for bankruptcy protection  plus an allowance for other amounts for which some potential loss is determined to be probable based on current circumstances 
if the financial condition of customers were to change  or if the company s assessment as to collectibility were to change  adjustments to the allowances may be required 
income taxes at june   the company had approximately million of deferred income tax benefits 
the realization of a portion of these benefits is dependent on the company s estimates of future taxable income and its tax planning strategies 
a million valuation allowance has been recorded in relation to certain state loss carryforwards  which will more likely than not expire unused 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be earned in the future to realize the remaining deferred income tax benefits 
however  the realization of these deferred income tax benefits can be impacted by changes to tax codes  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
business acquisitions assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
at june   the company had approximately million of goodwill  representing the cost of acquisitions in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired companies 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment testing 
the assessment of goodwill involves the estimation of the fair value of the company s reporting unit  as defined by sfas no 
management completed this assessment during the third quarter of fiscal  based on the best information available as of the date of assessment  and determined that no impairment existed 
there can be no assurance that future events will not result in impairments of goodwill or other assets 
results of operations the company derives its revenue from fees for providing engineering and consulting services 
the types of contracts with our customers and the approximate percentage of net service revenue nsr for the year ended june  from each contract type are as follows time and material fixed price or lump sum cost type with various fee arrangements in the course of providing its services  the company routinely subcontracts drilling  laboratory analyses  construction equipment and other services 
these costs are passed directly through to customers and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in gross revenue 
because subcontractor costs and direct charges can vary significantly from project to project  the company considers nsr  which is gross revenue less subcontractor costs and direct charges  as its primary measure of revenue growth 
the following table presents the percentage relationships of items in the consolidated statements of income to nsr years ended june  net service revenue operating costs and expenses cost of services general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization income from operations interest expense income before taxes federal and state income tax provision income before accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net income dividends and accretion charges on preferred stock net income available to common shareholders compared to the revenue growth trend established in fiscal continued for the seventh consecutive year 
gross revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal organic activities existing business provided million or of gross revenue growth in fiscal  with acquisitions providing the remaining million or of the gross revenue growth 
the increase from organic activities relates principally to significant subcontractor efforts incurred on certain exit strategy and other construction contracts during fiscal nsr increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal acquisitions provided million or of nsr growth in fiscal  with organic activities providing the remaining million or of the nsr growth 
organic activities continued to be affected by challenging economic conditions  particularly for large capital projects which generally lag behind initial periods of economic upturns  although in the fourth quarter organic activities provided of the nsr growth 
going forward  organic growth is expected to increase to support management s goal of providing a reasonable balance between organic and acquisition growth over a several year period 
nsr from acquired companies is considered part of acquisition growth during the twelve months following the date acquired 
cost of services increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily from the increase in nsr 
as a percentage of nsr  cost of services decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the improvement over last year resulted from cost reductions made to align capacity with the pace of activity 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal these increases were primarily due to additional costs required to support the company s growth  costs associated with the company s initial efforts to become compliant with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and an additional million of costs necessary to complete the company s fiscal audit 
the additional audit costs were recorded in the first quarter of fiscal and relate to the company s change in accounting for long term fixed price contracts in fiscal depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the additional depreciation expense related to capital expenditures completed in fiscal and  as well as the additional depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal interest expense increased by approximately in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding against the company s revolving credit facility to finance acquisition payments 
the company s percentage of debt to capitalization ratio was reduced by approximately to in fiscal this ratio continues to remain relatively low  reflecting management s conservative debt philosophy 
as a result of the above factors  income from operations increased by million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal for fiscal  acquisitions provided million or of the growth in operating income  and organic activities provided the remaining million or of the fiscal growth 
the provisions for federal and state income taxes reflect effective rates of in fiscal compared to in fiscal these increases were primarily due to the distribution of revenue in states with higher state income taxes 
the company believes that there will be sufficient taxable income in future periods to enable utilization of available deferred income tax benefits 
compared to the revenue growth trend established in fiscal continued for the sixth consecutive year 
gross revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal nsr increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the fiscal nsr growth was entirely attributable to acquisitions 
approximately of nsr growth for fiscal was from acquisitions while organic existing business nsr decreased by compared to the prior year 
management s goal continues to be to provide a reasonable balance between organic and acquisition growth over a several year period 
income from operations decreased by million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal acquisitions provided approximately million of operating income growth  while operating income from organic activities decreased by approximately million 
management s objective is to also maintain a reasonable balance over time between increases in income from operations derived from organic and acquisition growth 
for example  for fiscal years through  income from operations increases from organic and acquisition growth were and  respectively 
the inability to achieve this balance in fiscal as well as the increase in cost of services as a percentage of nsr was due to a reduction in the utilization of the company s staff related to three primary factors as follows challenging economic conditions which affected several of the company s operating centers 
until fiscal  these types of market changes were mitigated by increases in higher margin business 
the area most affected was the transportation infrastructure market where the company relies on funding from state and local government entities  the delay in new contract awards for exit strategy and other higher margin programs attributable to economic conditions  general customer uncertainty regarding capital investments  and unusual winter conditions  and costs associated with substantial hiring and project investments the company made in key markets which are expected to grow in spite of current economic conditions 
examples include the planning  design and installation of electric power transmission and distribution systems and the installation of distributed generation power systems  assisting customers in the planning and design of infrastructure security systems  and assisting customers in evaluating financial aspects of acquiring or divesting energy related assets 
in fiscal  management implemented actions to reduce costs  increase operational efficiencies and align capacity with the current pace of activity 
as these actions continue to yield results  and recent investments increasingly yield positive gains  management expects that a closer balance between organic and acquisition growth will again be realized 
general and administrative expenses g a increased approximately in fiscal primarily due to additional costs necessary to support the company s growth as well as increased costs for audit and legal services 
however  as a percentage of nsr  g a expenses only increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this demonstrates the company s ability to generate and manage the increased revenue without adding a proportional amount of overhead  resulting in higher margins for all services performed 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the additional depreciation expense of capital expenditures made throughout the year  the amortization expense related to identifiable intangibles from acquisitions  as well as the additional depreciation expense associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal and interest expense increased by approximately in fiscal compared to last year primarily due to higher average borrowings outstanding against the company s revolving credit facility to finance acquisitions 
the company s percentage of debt to capitalization ratio of continues to remain relatively low  reflecting management s conservative debt philosophy 
the provision for federal and state income taxes reflected an effective rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal this small increase was primarily due to higher state income taxes 
the company believes that there will be sufficient taxable income in future periods to enable utilization of available deferred income tax benefits 
the company changed its method of accounting for fixed price contracts  effective july  the cumulative effect of the change decreased net income by million net of income taxes of million or per diluted share  which was retroactively reflected in the first quarter of fiscal before the cumulative effect adjustment  this accounting change had the effect of increasing revenue  net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal by million  million and  respectively 
impact of inflation the company s operations have not been materially affected by inflation or changing prices because of the short term nature of many of its contracts and the fact that most contracts of a longer term are subject to adjustment or have been priced to cover anticipated increases in labor and other costs 
liquidity and capital resources the company primarily relies on cash from operations and financing activities  including borrowings based upon the strength of its balance sheet  to fund operations 
the company s liquidity is assessed in terms of its overall ability to generate cash to fund its operating and investing activities and to reduce debt 
of particular importance in the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  capital expenditure levels and an adequate bank line of credit 
cash flows from operating activities were million in fiscal  compared to million last year 
this type of year to year variance is typical primarily due to the timing of the collection of accounts receivable 
during fiscal  much of the cash was provided by the million of net income  the million charge for depreciation and amortization expense  the million provision for doubtful accounts  and the million increase in accrued compensation and benefits due to the timing of payroll payments 
the cash was offset by the million increase in accounts receivable resulting from the company s revenue growth 
the increase in net accounts receivable in fiscal was  which is equal to the percentage increase in gross revenue for the year 
accounts receivable include both billed receivables associated with invoices submitted for work previously completed and unbilled receivables work in progress 
the unbilled receivables are primarily related to work performed in the last month of the fiscal year 
the magnitude of accounts receivable for a professional services company is typically evaluated as days sales outstanding dso  which is calculated by dividing both current and long term receivables by the most recent six month average of daily gross revenue 
despite the increase in accounts receivable due to the growth in gross revenue  dso  which measures the collections turnover of both billed and unbilled receivables  has remained constant at year over year 
management s long term goal is to reduce dso to days 
billings in advance of revenue earned represents amounts collected in accordance with contractual terms before the work is performed  primarily on exit strategy contracts 
these payments provide the company with an advance source of cash for one to several years 
during years when the amount of payments from exit strategy contracts exceeds the amount of revenue recognized as work is performed on the contracts  billings in advance of revenue earned will increase and thereby provide operating cash flows 
during fiscal  the increase in billings in advance of revenue earned contributed million towards the total cash provided by operating activities 
during years when the amount of revenue recognized from work performed exceeds the amount of payments from exit strategy contracts  billings in advance of revenue earned will decrease and reduce operating cash flows 
upon signing of each contract with a finite cost cap insurance policy  a majority of the contract price is directly deposited in a restricted account held by american international group aig 
aig then pays the company from the deposited funds as work is performed 
the long term insurance receivable is associated with amounts held by aig for work performed  but which are currently not yet payable under the terms of the policy 
these amounts will be paid as the company completes work on the project 
the effect on periodic operating cash flows will vary depending upon the mix of work performed  but not yet payable and amounts reimbursed to the company by aig 
investing activities used cash of approximately million in fiscal compared to million last year 
the decrease was primarily due to the company s planned  temporary reduction in acquisitions during fiscal the investments this year consisted of million for acquisitions approximately million for current year acquisitions and approximately million for additional purchase price payments related to acquisitions completed in prior years  approximately million for capital expenditures for additional information technology and other equipment to support business growth and an additional million for investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
during fiscal  the company s financing activities used cash of million 
this cash  which was primarily provided by the exercise of stock options and warrants  was used to repay long term debt 
the company maintains a banking arrangement with wachovia bank  national association in syndication with three additional banks that provides a revolving credit facility to support operating and investing activities 
in march  the agreement was amended and restated with the amount available pursuant to the credit facility increased to million from million and the term extended to march borrowings under the agreement bear interest at wachovia s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus or minus applicable margins and would be due and payable in march when the agreement expires  unless it is extended as management expects 
borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by accounts receivable 
at june  outstanding borrowings pursuant to the agreement were million  at an average interest rate of  compared to million of outstanding borrowings  at an average interest rate of at june  during fiscal  the company significantly increased the free availability under the revolving credit facility 
the credit facility provides for affirmative and negative covenants that limit  among other things  the company s ability to incur other indebtedness  dispose of assets  pay cash dividends on its common stock and make certain investments 
in addition  the agreement includes certain restrictive covenants  including  but not limited to  the minimum ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense  income taxes and the current portion of long term debt  and the minimum ratio of adjusted current assets to adjusted total liabilities 
the company was in compliance with all covenants as of june  management expects that the cash generated from operations  the cash on hand at june  and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for currently anticipated activities 
if the company pursues material acquisitions or investments in the future in which the potential cash consideration approaches or exceeds the availability of current sources  the company would either increase its lending facility or pursue additional financing 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of june   certain information concerning the company s obligations to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt subordinated notes operating leases capitalized lease obligations total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases for most of its office facilities and certain equipment 
rental expense for operating leases was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal minimum operating lease obligations payable in future years ie  primarily base rent are presented above in contractual obligations
