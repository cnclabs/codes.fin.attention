item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the electronic component industry in which we operate is cyclical 
fiscal years and experienced significant growth and sales price strength as a result of an information technology expansion 
beginning in late fiscal  our customers began to experience declines in demand for their products and determined that they had accumulated excessive passive component inventory 
the utilization of the accumulated inventory and the decline in the worldwide economy led to significant declines in demand for our products throughout fiscal during fiscal  we experienced modest increases in unit demand in line with end market demands for our customers products  however  average selling prices for our products continued to decline 
in fiscal  we saw a substantial improvement in the markets that we serve when compared to fiscal and during fiscal  we saw some pricing stabilization  increases in unit demand  improvement in manufacturing capacity ut ilization and a more normal balance in supply chain inventories 
in reaction to the slow down in demand during the past several years  we significantly reduced our labor force and operating costs 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  of restructuring and special charges as part of our cost reduction and realignment initiatives 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities in conjunction with expected demand 
we continue to invest in new products and improvements to the production processes and are committed to investing in research  development and engineering in order to provide our customers with new generations of passive component and connector product solutions 
we believe this philosophy will enable us to capitalize on improved market conditions and provide shareholder value

outlook near term as noted above  the electronic component industry in which we operate is cyclical 
also  as noted above  in fiscal  we saw a substantial improvement in the markets we serve and during the second half of the fiscal year  some pricing stabilization  improvement in manufacturing capacity utilization and a more normal balance in supply chain inventories 
near term results for us will depend on growth in the economy and resulting expansion in the telecommunications  information technology hardware  automotive and other electronic markets 
we expect a continued  but more modest  decline in average selling prices for certain commodity related products which is more typical over a longer period of time in our industry than the rapid average selling price declines experienced during the last two years resulting from the imbalance of the industry s manufacturing capacity and end market demand 
as unit sales have increased during the last several quarters  the industry s manufacturing ca pacity utilization has steadily increased 
this has helped stabilize selling prices 
additionally  we have implemented restructuring programs  manufacturing realignments to low cost areas and other cost reduction programs which should benefit us during a recovery 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities in conjunction with current demand and future expectations 
accordingly  we may need to take additional restructuring actions which could lead to restructuring charges in future periods 
as a result of our completion of our previously announced acquisition of certain sales and marketing subsidiaries from kss  a wholly owned subsidiary of kyocera  effective april   we have the right to distribute crystal components previously sold by kinseki in the americas  europe and parts of asia 
annual sales of these products in these regions were approximately million for the fiscal year ended march  our sales of such products will be included in our results beginning in fiscal we have reorganized into a product line organization  effective april   with five main product groups ceramic  tantalum  advanced  connector and kyocera electronic devices ked 
the ked division will contain the new kss product group  along with our kdp product group that is currently reported in the passive group segment and kec product group that is currently reported in the connectors segment 
managers of each business unit will be responsible for the sales  marketing  production  research and development  and profitability of their division 
we are evaluating the impact this reorganization will have on our segment reporting  and accordingly all segment reporting for the fiscal year ending march  will reflect the changes required under sfas long term we continue to be optimistic that opportunities of long term growth and profitability will continue into fiscal due to a the continued increase as a long term trend in worldwide demand for electronic devices which require our electronic components  b cost reductions and improvements in our production processes and c opportunities for growth in our advanced product line due to advances in component design 
results of operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the fiscal year ended march  increased slightly to  million from  million for the fiscal year ended march  passive components sales during the year decreased to  million  while connector sales increased to million 
compared to the same period last year  passive component unit volumes increased approximately  reflecting increased demand partly due to the continued complexity and increased functionality of electronic products 
this increase in volume was partially offset by an overall decline in average selling prices for commodity related products of approximately resulting from changes in product mix and continued pricing pressure resulting from the industry s production capacity exceeding demand 
compared to the same period last year  the increase in connector sales was primarily attributable to new programs that came on line earlier this year  particularly in the automotive market

our sales to independent electronic component distributors represented of total sales for the fiscal year ended march   compared to for the fiscal year ended march  this increase reflects more normalized distribution inventory replenishment and higher sales activity by such distributors 
our sales to distributors involve specific ship and debit and stock rotation programs and price concessions for which sales allowances are recorded as reductions in sales 
we record an estimated sales allowance for ship and debit and stock rotation at the time of sale based on sales during the period  credits issued to distributors  distributor inventory levels  historical trends  market conditions  pricing trends we see in our direct sales activity with original equipment manufacturers and other customers and input from sales  marketing and other key management 
charges for ship and debit and stock rotation were million  or of gross sales to distributors  for th e fiscal year ended march  compared to charges of million  or of gross sales to distributors  for the fiscal year ended march  this decrease is attributable to a more stable market  as it relates to selling prices and inventory levels when compared to the same period last year 
we had remaining allowances for ship and debit and stock rotation of million and million at march  and  respectively 
we recognize liabilities for price concession at the time the concession is offered to the distributor 
charges for price concessions were million  or of gross sales to distributors  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to charges of million  or of gross sales to distributors  for the fiscal year ended march  we had remaining liabilities for price concession of million and million at march  and  respectively 
geographically  compared to the same period last year  sales as a percentage of total sales declined in the americas  offset by increases of in asia and in europe reflecting the continuing shift of production capabilities by our customers to the asian region 
compared to the same period last year  sales in asia and europe increased and  respectively  offset by a decline of in the americas 
when compared to the same period last year  reported sales in us dollars for europe reflect a favorable currency impact of approximately million resulting from the weakness of the us dollar relative to most european currencies 
unit sales volumes increased in all regions compared to the same period last year  particularly in asia and europe 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  results for the fiscal year ended march  include a materials charge of million recorded during the second quarter for the write down of current tantalum materials and future tantalum purchase commitments see the discussion of this materials charge below 
overall material usage increased million and labor cost increased million as a result of increased production 
these increases were offset by a decline in operating expense of million resulting from overall cost reductions and lower depreciation of million due to lower capital spending 
despite reductions in operating expenses and higher manufacturing volumes  gross profit was negatively impacted by lower sales prices  a sales mix favoring smaller part sizes which traditionally have lower average selling prices and higher tantalum raw material costs during the first half of the fiscal year 
additionally  as a result of the negative effect of foreign exchange resulting from the weakness of the us dollar  reported costs of sales for the year increased approximately million compared to the same period last year 
gross profit benefited from lower tantalum raw material costs during the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the materials charge that was recorded during the second quarter of the fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended march   gross profit was negatively impacted by special charges totaling million  primarily relating to employee severance and benefit costs resulting from the closure of a european facility that was initiated during the previous fiscal year 
we continue to focus on improvements in our manufacturing processes and to incur additional costs associated with the transfer of manufacturing operations to lower cost areas in china  malaysia  el salvador and the czech republic from facilities in the americas and europe

as a result of the cost of tantalum materials under the long term supply contract and the continued decline in selling prices for tantalum products  during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined  after identifying and monitoring key indicators of forecasted demand and average tantalum capacitor selling prices  that the weight of evidence regarding the sustained decline in average selling prices was sufficient to support a write down to net realizable value of the carrying value of our then current raw materials and work in process inventory and future purchase commitments under the long term supply agreement for tantalum materials 
based on our finished goods standard for tantalum products  finished goods were already recorded at net realizable value since the purchase price variances were not capitalized 
accordingly  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to cost of sales for the write down of our then current tantalum materials and future material purchase commitments 
we record inventory at the lower of cost or market realizable value 
estimated losses  included in the charge above  associated with our then current inventory of tantalum materials were million and million for raw materials and work in process  respectively 
also as a component of the charge above  we recorded estimated future losses from the commitment to purchase additional tantalum materials of million that consisted of million related to purchase commitments within twelve months and million related to purchase commitments exceeding twelve months 
these accrued net losses on firm purchase commitments  as adjusted for utilization of subsequent purchases for tantalum material under the agreement  are reflected in the balance sheet as current and non current liabilities of million and million  respectively  at march  the remaining accrued net losses will be utilized as we satisfy our remaining purchase commitments under the long term supply agreemen t 
we had future purchase commitments of million at march  at march   we had million of tantalum raw materials inventory that we expect will be utilized in the normal course of production 
the tantalum materials charge involved significant judgments on our part  including assumptions and estimates as to the future prices of finished products using these materials  additional cost to manufacture  and the timing  use  grade and quantity of our supply of tantalum material and future purchases under the supply agreement 
the raw material on hand as well as that in work in process and finished goods was considered in the assessment of realizable value for each period 
the raw materials component of work in process was written down to the net realizable value of the finished product that included aggregate cost components  the cost of production and direct selling expenses 
this write down did not reinstate a normal profit margin 
potential downward price adjustments under the supply agreement were not assumed in the estimates 
downward price adjustments are contingent upon the grade  quantity and price of tantalum materials sold by the supplier to third parties 
accordingly  there is no guarantee as to the future realizability of any downward price adjustments and amounts currently received may not be indicative of amounts that may be received in the future 
downward price adjustments are recorded as reductions in the costs of the related inventory when received 
therefore  the costs of materials will continue to reflect these write downs and downward price adjustments regardless of future price increases for tantalum products 
this could have the effect of increasing future earnings from what they would have been had we not taken the charge during the second quarter of the fiscal year ended march  if prices for tantalum products we sell were to recover in the future  we would not reverse the write downs that we have taken on our tantalum materials inventory or the charges that we have taken against future purchase commitments 
we could also be required to take additional write downs in the future if tantalum product selling prices experience further declines 
a dditionally  gross profit is impacted in the period in which the inventory write down occurred and in future periods as we use materials purchased under the long term supply agreement 
due to the large number of products containing tantalum  the number of production locations  the variety of specific raw materials purchased under the contract ie  unprocessed material  processed material  tantalum wire  and different grades and prices of material within each category  the mix of these and other purchased materials used in any one period  the status of these materials ie  raw materials  work in process or finished goods at any point in time  and the production yields  we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of the materials charge on gross profit in any individual reporting period

selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million of net sales  compared with million of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  direct selling expenses declined million primarily due to lower sales commissions paid to independent manufacturers representatives 
labor costs declined million as a result of headcount reductions  partially offset by million of increased costs for fringe benefits 
additionally  depreciation expense decline million as a result of lower capital expenditures 
research  development and engineering expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new and maintaining existing products  processes and technical innovations  were approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
research and development costs for the development of new products and processes are primarily classified in selling  general and administrative expenses  while engineering costs in connection with existing products and processes are primarily included in cost of sales 
the decline in research and development expenses was partially due to the transfer from development to production of certain new products 
the costs were incurred as we continue to enhance existing product lines  develop new products  convert to the use of base metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and develop high capacitance capacitors 
years ended march  cost of sales selling  general and administrative expense total research and development expense cost of sales selling general and administrative expense total research  development and engineering expense our restructuring activities undertaken during fiscal have been designed to reduce operating and overhead costs in response to the overall decline in the electronics industry that began during fiscal these activities include the closure of facilities and termination of employees 
operating results for the fiscal year ended march  include restructuring charges of million primarily related to the closure of manufacturing facilities in france  taiwan and mexico in addition to other worldwide headcount reductions in order to reduce operating costs to the level of business activity and relocate production to lower cost areas 
included in these restructuring charges is million related to worldwide headcount reductions across all geographic regions from employee termination programs and the facility closures referred to above affecting approximately employees 
substantially all of the balance of the workforce reduction expense remaining at march  is expected to be paid by the end of fiscal from existing cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operating activities 
the fixed asset impairments were related to facility closures 
impairment was based on the fair market value of assets to be sold or net realizable value for equipment to be disposed of 
during the fiscal year ended march   we decided to exit the ferrite component market  and this resulted in the decisions to close the manufacturing facilities in taiwan and france 
we anticipate that we will realize cost savings resulting from the closure of manufacturing facilities in taiwan  france and mexico and worldwide overhead headcount reductions initiated during the fiscal year ended march  in a range of million to million on an annual basis through lower labor costs and reduced operating expenses 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure and manufacturing capabilities in conjunction with current demand and future expectations 
accordingly  we may need to take additional restructuring actions that could lead to restructuring charges in future periods

other income decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is due to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on invested cash and securities  partially offset by lower interest expense on lower debt 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  was as tax benefits resulting from operating losses for certain european and asian operations were offset by valuation allowances recorded 
we provide allowances where there is a greater likelihood of not realizing the future tax benefits of net operating losses than of realizing them 
this compares to an effective tax rate of for the fiscal year ended march  income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended march  reflects million from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and a one time state tax refund related to a technology investment tax credit

year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to  million from  million for the fiscal year ended march  passive components sales during the year decreased to  million  while connector sales declined to million 
the decline in sales was primarily due to continued downward pricing pressure resulting in lower selling prices for commodity related products and the continuation of the trend toward smaller part sizes  which traditionally have lower average selling prices 
the decrease in revenue for passive components was also partially attributable to the continued soft demand across most markets  particularly the telecommunications and information technology hardware industries 
geographically  compared to the same period last year  sales in all regions declined 
the decrease in demand had a greater effect on european sales as customers continue to shift production capability to asia 
regionally  sales in europe  a sia and the americas declined  and to million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal our sales to independent electronic component distributors represented of total sales for the fiscal year ended march   compared to for the fiscal year ended march  this increase reflects improved distribution inventory replenishment and higher sales activity by such distributors

the decrease in charges for ship and debit  stock rotation and price concessions is a result of a more stable market as it relates to selling prices and inventory levels when compared to the same period last year 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to million of net sales from million of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  reductions in operating expenses and improved unit production were offset by reduced selling prices  negatively impacting gross profit in dollar terms and as a percentage of sales 
depreciation expense declined million as a result of lower capital expenditures 
raw material usage increased million due to continued high costs for raw materials  particularly tantalum powder  contributed to the higher cost of sales 
gross profit was also negatively impacted by special charges totaling million  primarily relating to employee severance and benefit costs resulting from the closure of a european facility that was initiated during the previous fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended march   gross profit was impacted by special charges of million  primarily relating to inventory write downs for precious metals see discussion below  obsolete raw materials and finished goods  and million of restructuring expense as part of a comprehensive plan to reduce operating costs and reorganize operations 
we continue to focus on improving our manufacturing processes and shifting production to lower labor cost areas such as eastern europe and asia 
as part of our cost reduction programs  we have continued our efforts to shift the majority of our production of commodity related multi layer ceramic capacitors from palladium to base metals  such as nickel 

table of contents 
we accumulated palladium inventories during fiscal and based upon customer forecasted demand 
during fiscal  due to the sudden and significant decrease in demand and the ongoing conversion to nickel  palladium inventory levels exceeded our forecasted quantity requirements 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a million charge for the write down of palladium to net realizable value 
we determined that a portion of the palladium we had on hand would ultimately be used in production and a portion was deemed to be in excess of the amount that would ultimately be used in production and therefore would be held for sale 
the million charge included million to adjust the carrying value of the palladium held for production to net realizable value and million to adjust the carrying value of the palladium held for sale to the current market price 
the raw materials component of palladium based product was written down to the net realizable value of the finished product that included aggregate cost components  the cost of production and direct selling expenses 
this write down did not reinstate a normal profit margin 
in the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of increased demand for components using palladium  we began using the remaining balance of this excess palladium inventory in production 
accordingly  we no longer record the effects of market price reductions on palladium inventory 
the palladium inventory is being used in production at its current raw material carrying cost 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  were million of net sales  compared with million of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the expenses for the fiscal year ended march  include a million special charge for doubtful customers receivables 
direct selling expenses declined million primarily due to lower sales commissions paid to independent manufacturers representatives

the costs were incurred as we continue to enhance existing product lines  develop new products  convert to the use of base metals in the manufacture of ceramic capacitors and develop high capacitance capacitors 
as a result of the above factors  the loss from operations for the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to a loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  as discussed above  the loss from operations included special charges of million in fiscal compared to special charges and restructuring costs totaling million in fiscal other income decreased million to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is due to lower interest income resulting from lower interest rates on invested cash and securities  partially offset by lower interest expense on lower debt 
income tax expense of million for the fiscal year ended march  reflects million from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and a one time state tax refund related to a technology investment tax credit offset primarily by the non recognition of tax benefits related to certain foreign net operating losses

financial condition liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements  dividends  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
historically  the company has satisfied its liquidity requirements through funds from operations and investment income from cash and investments in securities 
as of march   we had a current ratio of to  million of cash  cash equivalents and investments in securities   million of stockholders equity and an insignificant amount of debt 
net cash from operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  purchases of property and equipment were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal these expenditures related to expanding the production capabilities of the passive component and connector product lines  moving production capacity to lower cost regions such as latin america  eastern europe and asia  as well as the implementation of lower cost manufacturing processes 
this includes the construction of a  square foot manufacturing facility in china that was started during fiscal and neared completion at the end of fiscal production will be transferred to this facility over the next several years 
capital expenditures over the past two fiscal years have declined in response to the slow down in the rate of growth in demand for our customers products and the corresponding demand in production requirements 
the carrying value for our equipment reflects the use of the accelerated double declining balance method to compute depreciation expense for machinery and equipment 
we continue to add additional capacity for advanced and specialty passive component and connector products and expect to incur capital expenditures of million to million in fiscal the actual amount of capital expenditures will depend upon the outlook for end market demand 
the majority of our funding is internally generated through operations and investment income from cash and investments in securities 
based on our financial condition as of march   we believe that cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operating activities and investment income will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated financing needs for working capital  capital expenditures  environmental clean up costs  research  development and engineering expenses  and any dividend payments or stock repurchases to be made during the year 
while changes in customer demand have an impact on our future cash requirements  changes in those requirements are mitigated by our ability to adjust manufacturing capabilities to meet increases or decreases in customer demand 
additionally  we do not anticipate any significant changes in our ability to generate or meet our liquidity needs in the long term 
although the majority of our funding is internally generated  certain of our european subsidiaries have from time to time borrowed various european currencies under various bank agreements 
at march   outstanding balances under such agreements were insignificant 
these borrowings have been used primarily to fund regional working capital requirements 
at march   we had contractual obligations for the acquisition or construction of plant and equipment aggregating approximately million 
we are a lessee under long term operating leases primarily for office space  plant and equipment 
future minimum lease commitments under non cancelable operating leases as of march   were as follows

years ended march in thousands of dollars  thereafter during the fiscal year ended march   we entered into a tantalum supply agreement for a portion of our anticipated tantalum usage 
under the agreement  quantities to be delivered were fixed for the next five years 
prices were fixed for the first two years and are subject to downward price adjustments based upon market conditions for the remaining three years 
downward price adjustments are contingent upon the grade  quantity and price of tantalum materials sold by the supplier to third parties 
accordingly  there is no guarantee as to the future realizability of any downward price adjustments and amounts currently received may not be indicative of amounts that may be received in the future 
downward price adjustments are recorded as reductions in the costs of the related inventory when received 
we received downward price adjustments during the fiscal year ended march  of million

avx filed a complaint on july   against cabot corporation cabot in us district court for the district of massachusetts the federal court with respect to the existing supply agreement with cabot for tantalum powder  ore and wire  alleging violations of federal laws known as the robinson patman act 
just before the dismissal of that case by stipulation on jurisdictional grounds on march   cabot filed a court action in the superior court for suffolk county  commonwealth of massachusetts the state court on march   seeking a declaratory judgment to determine the rights and obligations of each party 
avx then filed a counterclaim against cabot in the state court on april   restating the affirmative claims asserted in the federal court action for money damages for unfair and deceptive trade practices by cabot  breach of contract and other related matters 
in particular  avx asserts that in fiscal cabot took advantage of a shortage of tantalum on the market to induce avx to execute a long term contract at inflated prices by threatening to breach the contract then in effect between the parties  and that cabot made false or misleading assertions during the course of those dealings 
avx has also filed claims for breach of the long term contract because of defective product 
avx seeks  pursuant to the action  injunctive relief  actual and treble damages in amounts to be determined at trial and attorney s fees 
on march   avx filed a second action in federal court against cabot alleging certain violations of the federal antitrust laws 
the facts alleged in this action relate to the same contracts  but in this action avx alleged cabot engaged in conduct that violated federal anti trust laws known as the sherman anti trust act

ship and debit authorizations may cover current and future distributor activity for a specific part for sale to their customer 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
topic  revenue recognition  at the time we record sales to the distributors  we provide an allowance for the estimated future distributor activity related to such sales since it is probable that such sales to distributors will result in ship and debit activity 
the sales allowance requirement is based on sales during the period  credits issued to distributors  distributor inventory levels  historical trends  market conditions  pricing trends we see in our direct sales activi ty with original equipment manufacturers and other customers  and input from sales  marketing and other key management 
these procedures require the exercise of significant judgments 
we believe that they enable us to make reliable estimates of future credits under the ship and debit program 
our actual results approximate our estimates 
at the time the distributor ships the part from stock  the distributor debits us for the authorized pricing adjustment 
distributor price concession distributors may be granted price concessions based on the difference in the price paid for the inventory on hand at the distributor and a reduction by avx in sales prices quoted for our products book prices 
since many of our independent electronic component distributors have already entered into special pricing arrangements volume pricing arrangements for their substantial purchases of products it is not probable that we will provide such price concessions 
we account for such concessions in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer eitf 
at the time of authorization  sales allowances are recorded at the maximum level for the difference in price of the inventory on hand at the distributor and our revised book price 
when the price concession is authorized the distributor is given credit against their accounts receivable 
accounts receivable we report provisions for bad debts as a component of selling expenses 
we review specific accounts for collectability based upon circumstances known to us at the date of our financial statements 
in addition  we maintain general reserves based upon historical billing adjustments and write offs 
these estimates are based upon historical discounts  bad debts  customer concentrations  changes in customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
warranty all of our products are built to specification and tested by avx for adherence to such specification before shipment to customers 
we warrant to the original purchaser of our products that we will repair or replace  without charge  products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue for product warranties when it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold and a reasonable estimate of costs can be made 
the amount accrued represents the return of value of the customer s inventory and direct costs of replacement 
return of value may result in a direct credit to the customer s account for the purchase price or replacement product and other related costs

inventories the valuation of inventory requires us to make certain assumptions and judgments to estimate net realizable value 
inventories are adjusted for estimates of obsolescence or written down to net realizable value based upon estimates of future demand  technology developments and market conditions 
we determine the cost of raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market realizable value in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
arb 
arb requires that inventory be valued at its market value where there is evidence that the utility of goods will be less than cost and that such write down should occur in the current period 
accordingly  at the end of each period we evaluate our inventory and adjust to net realizable value the carrying value and excess quantities 
we calculate the value of slow moving finished goods inventory based on historical usage  customer forecasts received from the marketing and sales personnel  customer backlog  certain date code restrictions and general market conditions 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted and excess quantities are scrapped for technology changes  customer backlog and forecast changes  demand increases and decreases  market directional shifts  and obsolescence and aging 
in addition to finished goods  we apply these principles to raw materials and work in process inventories 
property and equipment and other long lived assets property and equipment are recorded at cost 
machinery and equipment are generally depreciated on the double declining balance method over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of property and equipment or closing of facilities could result in shortened useful lives 
long lived assets are reviewed by us for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the discounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the related assets  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
goodwill the carrying value of goodwill is evaluated at least annually or whenever conditions indicate that such impairment could exist 
the carrying value of goodwill is evaluated in relation to the operating performance and estimated future discounted cash flows of the related operating unit 
if the sum of the discounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the related assets  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance

restructuring from time to time  we record charges relating to efforts to strategically reposition our operations 
these charges include estimates for termination costs for employees affected by plant closings and other reduction in force efforts 
the accruals are based on various factors including the employees length of service  contract provisions  salary levels and governmental regulations 
at the date we approve a restructuring plan and satisfy other required accounting criteria  a liability for the estimated costs associated with that restructuring plan is established 
until the plan activities are completed  the actual cost may differ from the estimate 
we use judgments and information available at the date of the financial statements to reevaluate the initial estimate of the plan costs 
if circumstances change and previous estimates are no longer accurate  we adjust the reserve with a corresponding increase or decrease to current period earnings 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our tax assets and liabilities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
with the establishment of a valuation allowance or increases to the allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have recorded valuation allowances due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we have recorded a deferred tax liability at march  and of million and million  respectively  for temporary differences associated with deductions for foreign branch losses claimed by the company on its us income tax returns 
we also record a provision for certain international  federal and state tax contingencies based on the likelihood of obligation  when needed 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to challenges from us and non us tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
further  during the ordinary course of business  other changing facts and circumstances may impact our ability to utilize tax benefits as well as the estimated taxes to be paid in future periods 
management believes it has appropriately accrued for tax exposures 
if we are required to pay an amount less than or exceeding our provisions for uncertain tax matters  the financial impact will be reflected in the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to adjust tax accounts which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
pension assumptions pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
we have little latitude in selecting this rate  as it is required to represent the market rate for high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
these assumptions are evaluated peri odically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
in such cases  the differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are amortized over future periods

environmental liabilities we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the environment in the united states and to the environmental laws and regulations of the other countries in which we operate 
based on our periodic review of the operating policies and practices at all of our facilities  we believe that our operations currently comply  in all material respects  with all of these laws and regulations 
regarding sites identified by the epa at which remediation is required  our ultimate liability in connection with environmental claims will depend on many factors  including our volumetric share of non environmentally safe waste  the total cost of remediation and the financial viability of other companies having liability 
once it becomes probable that we will incur costs in connection with remediation of a site and such costs can be reasonably estimated  we establish or adjust our reserves for our projected share of these costs 
these reserves are not discounted and do not reflect any possible future insurance recoveries  which are not expected to be significant  but do reflect a reasonable estimate of cost sharing at multiple party sites or indemnification of our liability by a third party

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose  for example  to facilitate securitization  leasing  hedging  research and development  or other transactions or arrangements 
formerly consolidation of certain special purpose entities in its draft form  this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no

relationship with kyocera and related transactions kyocera is the majority stockholder of avx 
as of june   kyocera owned beneficially and of record  shares of common stock  representing approximately of our outstanding shares 
from january through august   avx was wholly owned by kyocera 
on august   kyocera sold  or  shares of avx s common stock  and avx sold an additional  common shares  in a public offering 
in february  kyocera sold an additional  shares of its avx common stock 
avx did not receive any of the proceeds from the february offering 
since january  kyocera and avx have engaged in a significant number and variety of related party transactions  including  without limitation  the transactions referred to in notes and to the consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form k 
one principal strategic advantage for us is our ability to produce a broad product offering for our customers 
the inclusion of products manufactured by kyocera in that product offering is a significant component of this advantage 
in addition  the exchange of information with kyocera relating to the development and manufacture of multi layer capacitors and various other ceramic products benefits us 
an adverse change in our relationship with kyocera could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we also have established several ongoing arrangements with kyocera and have executed several agreements  the more significant of which are described below 
except for the buzzer assembly agreement  each of the agreement s described below contains provisions requiring that the terms of any transaction under such agreement be equivalent to that to which an independent unrelated party would agree at arm s length and is subject to the approval of the special advisory committee of our board of directors 
the special advisory committee is comprised of our independent directors and is required to review and approve such agreements and any other significant transactions between us and kyocera not covered by such agreements 
periodically  the special advisory committee reviews a summary of our transactions with kyocera to identify any significant transactions not covered by such agreements and investigates the nature and the terms of such transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency our european sales  which accounted for approximately of fiscal sales  are denominated in local  us and japanese currencies  while those in north america and asia generally are denominated in us dollars 
also  certain manufacturing and operating costs denominated in local currencies are incurred in europe  asia  mexico and central and south america 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our operating results and cash flow 
in order to minimize the effect of movements in currency exchange rates  we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge external and intercompany foreign currency transactions 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we have no material hedging commitments other than in europe 
currency exchange gains and losses have been immaterial during the periods presented 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in all european currencies against the us dollar  with the resulting functional currency gains and losses translated into us dollars at the spot rate  the resulting net loss would have an estimated impact on our results before income taxes of million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
materials we are at risk to fluctuations in prices for commodities used to manufacture our products  primarily palladium and tantalum 
tantalum powder and wire are principle materials used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitor products 
these materials are purchased under contracts with suppliers from various parts of the world at prices that are subject to periodic adjustment 
tantalum powder prices have fluctuated in a range of to per pound during the last three fiscal years 
the market price was approximately per pound at march  the tantalum required to manufacture our products has generally been available in sufficient quantity 
the limited number of tantalum material suppliers has led to higher prices during periods of increased demand 
during this period of increased demand we entered into a long term supply agreement for a portion of our anticipated tantalum requirements 
as a result of the cost of tantalum materials under this contract and the continued decline in selling prices for tantalum products  in the second quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge of million for t he write down of our then current tantalum raw materials and work in process inventories and future material purchase commitments 
our purchase commitments were entered into at a time when market demand for tantalum capacitors was high and tantalum raw materials were believed to be in short supply 
if the downward trend in the prices at which we sell tantalum products were to continue  we could again be required to write down the carrying value of our tantalum inventory and record additional losses on our purchase commitments 
palladium  a precious metal currently used in the manufacture of a small portion of our multi layer ceramic capacitors  is primarily purchased from various companies in the form of palladium sponge and ingot 
the main areas of mining of palladium are in russia and south africa 
palladium is considered a commodity and is subject to price volatility and has fluctuated in a range of approximately to per troy ounce during the past three fiscal years 
the market price was approximately per troy ounce at march  we have addressed the volatility in the price of palladium by i adjusting the manufacturing process for the parts made with palladium to reduce the amount of the precious metal used in each part  and ii substituting base metals  such as nickel  in the production of multi layer ceramic capacitors 
the majority of our commodity related ceramic capacitors are currently manufactured using nickel
