item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploration  acquisition  development  production and sale of natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids primarily from unconventional reservoirs such as fractured shales  coal beds and tight sands 
at december   approximately of our proved reserves were natural gas 
approximately of those reserves are located in michigan 
our michigan activities have allowed us to develop a technical and operational expertise in the acquisition  development and production of unconventional natural gas reserves 
consistent with one of our business strategies  our canadian coal bed methane and indiana new albany shale projects represent an extension of that expertise 
for  we plan to focus on the exploration and development of cbm reserves in alberta  canada  the new albany shale in indiana kentucky and the barnett shale in texas 
we expect budgeted capital expenditures for to be approximately million  of which  about million is allocated to our canadian operations with the remainder allocated to our us operations 
we generate net income and cash flows on an ongoing basis by producing natural gas  crude oil and natural gas liquids in quantities and at prices that allow us to not only generate operating income  but also allow us to conduct exploration  development and acquisition activities to efficiently replace the reserves that have been produced 
we use several measurements to determine our performance 
among the key measurements we use are cash flow from operating activities  operating expenses per unit of production  overhead costs per unit of production  finding costs per unit of reserve addition  and the ratio of total reserve additions to production during a given period of time 
natural gas prices were favorable throughout and many industry analysts expect them to remain favorable for the foreseeable future 
if prices for natural gas remain favorable  we will be able to fund more of our capital expenditures with cash flow from operations  however  we do not expect our cash flow from operations to be sufficient to satisfy our total budgeted capital expenditures 
to fund our total budgeted capital expenditures in we plan to borrow additional funds under our existing bank credit facility 
consequently  our level of debt will increase 
as of december   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility 
the ratio of our total debt to equity as of december  was approximately one to one 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the possibility of decreasing prices to be received for production is among the several risks that we face 
we manage this risk by entering into natural gas sales contracts with price floors and natural gas and crude oil financial hedges 
our commodity risk management strategy helps to ensure a predictable base level of cash flow  which enhances our ability to execute our drilling and exploration programs  meet debt service requirements and pursue acquisition opportunities despite price fluctuations 
if our revenues decrease significantly as a result of presently unexpected declines in natural gas prices or otherwise  we may curtail our acquisition  development drilling and other activities outside of canada and secondarily within canada 
we could also be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
forward looking information certain statements contained in this annual report and other materials we file with the sec  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements may relate to a variety of matters not currently ascertainable  such as future capital expenditures  drilling activity  acquisitions and dispositions  development or exploratory activities  cost savings efforts  production activities and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  hedging activities and the results thereof  financing plans  liquidity  regulatory matters  competition and our ability to realize efficiencies related to certain transactions or organizational changes 
forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as may  will  could  should  anticipate  believe  budgeted  expect  intend  plan  project  potential  estimate  continue  or future or the negative  other variations thereof or other or similar statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove correct 
factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forward looking statements include changes in general economic conditions  fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices  failure or delays in achieving expected production from oil and gas development projects  uncertainties inherent in estimates of oil and gas reserves and predicting oil and gas reservoir performance  competitive conditions in our industry  actions taken by third party operators  processors and transporters  changes in the availability and cost of capital  operating hazards  natural disasters  casualty losses and other matters beyond our control  the effects of existing and future laws and governmental regulations  the effects of existing or future litigation  and certain factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
all forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this section 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates described below 
we believe the reported financial results are reliable and that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported 

table of contents 
index to financial statements oil and gas properties we employ the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas production assets 
under the full cost method  all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit of production basis using proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of related deferred tax or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of i estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on unescalated year end prices and costs  adjusted for contract provisions and financial derivatives that hedge our oil and gas revenue  ii the cost of properties not being amortized  iii the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized less iv income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and gas properties 
such limitations are imposed separately for the us and canadian cost centers 
the ceiling test is affected by a decrease in net cash flow from reserves due to higher operating or finding costs or reduction in market prices for natural gas and crude oil 
these changes can reduce the amount of economically producible reserves 
at december   the capitalized cost  inclusive of future development costs  for us and canadian reserves was per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
if the cost center ceiling falls below the capitalized cost for the cost center  we would be required to report an impairment of the cost center s oil and gas assets at the reporting date 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to the product transfers to purchasers 
we follow the sales method of accounting for revenue for natural gas and crude oil production  so that we recognize sales revenue on all production sold to purchasers  regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property 
a receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves 
ultimate revenues from the sales of natural gas and crude oil production is not known with certainty until up to three months after production and title transfer occur 
current revenues are accrued based on our estimate of actual deliveries and actual prices received 
hedging we enter into financial derivative instruments to hedge risk associated with the prices received from natural gas and crude oil production and marketing 
we also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest rates on our debt outstanding 
every derivative instrument is recorded on our balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
the cash settlement of all derivative instruments is recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
gains or losses on derivative instruments terminated prior to their original expiration date are deferred and recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
the ineffective portion of hedges is recognized currently in earnings 
portions of our hedge derivatives were classified as current based upon the maturity of the derivative instruments 
based upon the estimated fair values of those hedge derivatives as of december   our revenues for will decrease approximately million and interest expense will increase approximately million 
net income  after income taxes will be approximately million lower 
these amounts will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income in site dismantlement and asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and associated production facilities 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 
table of contents 
index to financial statements accounting for asset retirement obligations effective january  under sfas no 
 the estimated fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets is recorded in the periods in which it is incurred 
when the liability is recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to the fair value at the time of the settlement over the useful life of the asset  and the capitalized cost is depleted or depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
the fair value of the liability associated with these retirement obligations is based upon estimates of the current costs to settle such obligations discounted using a credit adjusted risk free interest rate that considers the estimated date of settlement of those obligations 
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 we recognized asset retirement costs of million and asset retirement obligations of million and a cumulative effect adjustment of million 
the cumulative effect adjustment of million included million for additional depletion and depreciation of the asset retirement costs  million for accretion of the fair value of the asset retirement obligations and million for deferred tax expenses 
during  million of accretion expense was recognized and included in the million of depletion  depreciation and accretion expense reported in the statement of income for the year 
additional asset retirement costs and obligations of million were recognized during these amounts are associated with long lived assets placed into service in asset retirement obligations at december  are million  of which  has been classified as current 
income taxes deferred income taxes are established for all temporary differences between the book and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax balances must be adjusted to reflect tax rates that will be in effect in years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
mgv  the company s canadian subsidiary  computes taxes at rates in effect in canada 
us deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on profits that are expected to be permanently reinvested by mgv and thus are not considered available for distribution to the parent company 
included in our net deferred tax liability are million of future tax benefits from prior unused tax losses 
realization of these tax assets depends on sufficient future taxable income before the benefits expire 
we believe we will have sufficient future taxable income to utilize the loss carry forward benefits before they expire  however  if not  we could be required to recognize a loss for some or all of these tax assets 
net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets are reviewed annually for recoverability  and are recorded  net of a valuation allowance  if necessary 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  special purpose entities  financing partnerships or guarantees 
the companies in which we have an equity investment do not have any debts

the current borrowing base is million and is subject to semi annual redetermination and certain other redeterminations based upon several factors 
scheduled redeterminations occur on may and november of each year 
our borrowing base is impacted primarily by the fair value of our oil and gas reserves 
changes in the fair value of our oil and gas reserves are affected by prices for natural gas and crude oil  operating expenses and the results of our drilling activity 
a significant decline in the fair value of our reserves could reduce our borrowing base 
a borrowing base reduction could limit our ability to carry out our capital expenditure programs and possibly require the repayment of a portion of our current bank borrowings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have established policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization  including internal controls 
the level of risk assumed by us is based on our objectives and capacity to manage risk 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our primary risk exposure is related to natural gas and crude oil commodity prices 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of swaps  futures and forward contracts  however  we have also limited future gains from favorable movements 
commodity price risk we enter into various contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas and crude oil production 
these contracts have included physical sales contracts and derivatives including price ceilings and floors  no cost collars and fixed price swaps 
as of december   we sell approximately  mcfd and  mcfd of natural gas under long term contracts with floor prices of per mcf and per mcf  respectively  through march approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production was sold under these contracts during the remaining  mcfd sold under these contracts were third party volumes controlled by us 
these contracts are not considered derivatives  but rather normal sales contracts under sfas no 
approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production is hedged using fixed price swap agreements at a weighted average price of per mcf 
these agreements expire from april to april an additional  mcfd of our first quarter natural gas production and bbld of our crude oil production is hedged using price collars 
as a result of these various contracts  we benefit from significant predictability of our natural gas and crude oil revenues 
the following table summarizes our open financial derivative positions as of december  related to natural gas and crude oil production

as a result of the hedging programs  revenues from production were lower than if the hedging program had not been in effect by million in  million in and million in commodity price fluctuations affect our remaining natural gas and crude oil volumes as well as our ngl volumes 
up to  mcfd of natural gas is committed at market price through may additional natural gas volumes of  mcfd are committed at market price through september during  approximately  mcfd of our natural gas production was sold under these contracts 
an additional  mcfd sold under these contracts were third party volumes controlled by us 
based on our average production and long term natural gas sales contracts with floor prices of per mcf and per mcf  and our average production  each per mcf increase decrease in the

index to financial statements price of natural gas would increase decrease our revenue by approximately million 
should additional revenue of million be realized  approximately million would be required for settlement of our existing fixed price hedges 
prior to ceasing operations as of january   cinnabar energy services trading  llc  our wholly owned marketing company  also entered into various financial contracts to hedge its exposure to commodity price risk associated with future contractual natural gas sales and purchases of third party volumes 
these contracts included either fixed and floating price sales or purchases from third parties 
as a result of these firm sale and purchase commitments and associated financial price swaps  the hedge derivatives qualified as fair value hedges 
marketing revenues were higher by million in  and lower by million and million in and  respectively as a result of hedging activities 
hedge ineffectiveness resulted in  of net gains   of net losses and  net gains recorded to other revenue for  and  respectively

the net differential between the prices in each derivative and commitment and market prices for future periods  as adjusted for estimated basis  has been applied to the volumes stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated future value 
this estimated future value was discounted on each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives 
as a result  the fair value of our derivatives and commitments does not necessarily represent the value a third party would pay to assume our contract positions 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure associated with interest rates by entering into interest rate swaps 
as of december   the interest payments for million notional variable rate debt are hedged with an interest rate swap that converts a floating three month libor base to a fixed rate through march  our liability associated with the swap was million at december  
table of contents 
index to financial statements on september   we entered into an interest rate swap to hedge the million of fixed rate second lien notes issued on june  the swap converts the debt s fixed rate debt to a floating six month libor base 
our asset associated with the swap was  at december  in january  the swap position was cancelled  and we received a cash settlement of million that will be recognized over the original maturity date for the swap  december  interest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million higher  respectively  as a result of the interest rate swaps 
if interest rates on our variable interest rate debt of million  as of january   increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual pretax income will decrease or increase by million 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
we sell a portion of our natural gas production directly under long term contracts  and the remainder of our natural gas and crude oil was sold through cinnabar until december  all such natural gas and crude oil is sold to large trading companies and energy marketing companies  refineries and other users of petroleum products 
we also enter into hedge derivatives with financial counterparties 
we monitor exposure to counterparties by reviewing credit ratings  financial statements and credit service reports 
exposure levels are limited and parental guarantees are required according to our established policy 
each customer and or counterparty is reviewed as to credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit and on a regular basis thereafter 
in this manner  we reduce credit risk 
while we follow our credit policies at the time we enter into sales contracts  the credit worthiness of counterparties could change over time 
in fact  standard poors and moody s downgraded credit ratings of the parent companies of the two counterparties to our long term gas contracts in early please see item risk factors 
performance risk performance risk results when a financial counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligations such as commodity pricing or volume commitments 
typically  such risk obligations are defined within the trading agreements 
we manage performance risk through management of credit risk 
each customer and or counterparty is reviewed as to credit worthiness prior to the extension of credit and on a regular basis thereafter 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in canada are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
while cross currency transactions are immaterial  the result of a ten percent change in the canadian us exchange rate would increase or decrease equity by approximately million at december
