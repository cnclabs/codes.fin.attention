item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and overview constellation energy group  inc constellation energy is a north american energy company that conducts its business through various subsidiaries including a merchant energy business and baltimore gas and electric company bge 
we describe our operating segments in note this report is a combined report of constellation energy and bge 
references in this report to we and our are to constellation energy and its subsidiaries  collectively 
references in this report to the utility business are to bge 
our merchant energy business is a competitive provider of energy solutions for large customers in north america 
it has electric generation assets located in various regions of the united states and provides energy solutions to meet customers needs 
our merchant energy business focuses on serving the full energy and capacity requirements load serving activities of  and providing other risk management activities for various wholesale customers  such as utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  and retail aggregators  and for retail commercial and industrial customers 
these load serving activities typically occur in regional markets in which end use customer electricity rates have been deregulated and thereby separated from the cost of generation supply 
our wholesale marketing and risk management operation actively uses energy and energy related commodities in order to manage our portfolio of energy purchases and sales to customers through structured transactions 
as part of our risk management activities we trade power and gas to enable price discovery and facilitate the hedging of our load serving and other risk management products and services 
within our trading function we allow limited risk taking activities for profit 
these activities are actively managed through daily value at risk and liquidity position limits 
we discuss value at risk in more detail later in the market risk section 
bge is a regulated electric transmission and distribution utility company and a regulated gas distribution utility company with a service territory that covers the city of baltimore and all or part of ten counties in central maryland 
our other nonregulated businesses design  construct  and operate heating  cooling  and cogeneration facilities for commercial  industrial  and municipal customers throughout north america  and provide home improvements  service heating  air conditioning  plumbing  electrical  and indoor air quality systems  and provide natural gas retail marketing to residential customers in central maryland 
in addition  we own several investments that we do not consider to be core operations 
these include financial investments  real estate projects  and interests in a latin american distribution project and in a fund that holds interests in two south american energy projects 
in this discussion and analysis  we will explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for constellation energy and bge including factors which affect our businesses  our earnings and costs in the periods presented  changes in earnings and costs between periods  sources of earnings  impact of these factors on our overall financial condition  expected future expenditures for capital projects  and expected sources of cash for future capital expenditures 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for   and our results reflect a significant increase in revenues and operating expenses mainly due to the implementation of emerging issues task force issue eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities in january  as well as the full year impact of our acquisitions  newenergy and alliance 
we discuss the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles in note and our acquisitions in note we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of our consolidated statements of income 
we have organized our discussion and analysis as follows first  we discuss our strategy 
we then describe the business environment in which we operate including how regulation  weather  and other factors affect our business 
next  we discuss our critical accounting policies 
these are the accounting policies that are most important to both the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
we highlight significant events that occurred in that are important to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we then review our results of operations beginning with an overview of our total company results  followed by a more detailed review of those results by operating segment 
we review our financial condition addressing our sources and uses of cash  security ratings  capital resources  capital requirements  and commitments 
we conclude with a discussion of our exposure to various market risks 
strategy we are pursuing a balanced strategy to distribute energy through our north american competitive supply activities and our regulated utility located in maryland  bge 
our merchant energy business focuses on long term  high value sales of energy  capacity  and related products to large customers  including distribution utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  industrial customers  and commercial customers primarily in the regional markets in which end use customer electricity rates have been deregulated and thereby separated from the cost of generation supply 
these markets include the new england  new york  and mid atlantic regions  texas  the mid west region  the west region  and certain areas in canada 
we obtain this energy through both owned and contracted generation 
our generation fleet is strategically located in deregulated markets across the country and is diversified by fuel type  including nuclear  coal  gas  oil  and renewable sources 
where we do not own generation  we contract for power from other merchant providers  typically through power purchase agreements 
we intend to remain diversified between regulated transmission and distribution and competitive supply 
we will use both our owned generation and our contracted generation to support our competitive supply operation 
we are a leading national competitive supplier of energy in the deregulated markets previously discussed 
in our wholesale and commercial and industrial retail marketing activities we are leveraging our recognized expertise in providing full requirements energy and energy related services to enter markets  capture market share  and organically grow these businesses 
through the application of technology  intellectual capital  and increased scale  we are seeking to reduce the cost of delivering full requirements energy and energy related services and managing risk 
we are also responding proactively to customer needs by expanding the variety of products we offer 
our wholesale competitive supply activities include a growing customer products operation that markets physical energy products and risk management and logistics services sold to generators  distributors  producers of coal  natural gas and fuel oil  and other consumers 
within our retail competitive supply activities  we are marketing a broader array of products and expanding our markets 
over time  we may consider integrating the sale of electricity and natural gas to provide one energy procurement solution for our customers 
collectively  the integration of owned and contracted electric generation assets with origination  fuel procurement  and risk management expertise  allows our merchant energy business to earn incremental margin and more effectively manage energy and commodity price risk over geographic regions and over time 
our focus is on providing solutions to customers energy needs  and our wholesale marketing and risk management operation adds value to our owned and contracted generation assets by providing national market access  market infrastructure  real time market intelligence  risk management and arbitrage opportunities  and transmission and transportation expertise 
generation capacity supports our wholesale marketing and risk management operation by providing a source of reliable power supply that provides a physical hedge for some of our load serving activities 
to achieve our strategic objectives  we expect to continue to pursue opportunities that expand our access to customers and to support our wholesale marketing and risk management operation with generation assets that have diversified geographic  fuel  and dispatch characteristics 
we also expect to grow organically through selling a greater number of physical energy products and services to large energy customers 
we expect to achieve operating efficiencies within our competitive supply operation and our generation fleet by selling more products through our existing sales force  benefiting from efficiencies of scale  adding to the capacity of existing plants  and making our business processes more efficient 
we expect bge and our other retail energy service businesses to grow through focused and disciplined expansion primarily from new customers 
at bge  we are also focused on enhancing reliability and customer satisfaction 
customer choice  regulatory change  and energy market conditions significantly impact our business 
in response  we regularly evaluate our strategies with these goals in mind to improve our competitive position  to anticipate and adapt to the business environment and regulatory changes  and to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit quality 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we undertook a number of initiatives to reduce our costs towards competitive levels and to ensure that our resources are focused on our core energy businesses 
these initiatives included the implementation of workforce reduction programs  termination of all planned power plant development projects not under construction  the acceleration of our exit strategy for certain non core assets  and the implementation of productivity initiatives 
we are constantly reevaluating our strategies and might consider acquiring or developing additional generating facilities to support our merchant energy business  mergers or acquisitions of utility or non utility businesses or assets  and sale of assets or one of more businesses 
business environment general industry over the past several years  the utility industry and energy markets experienced significant changes as a result of less liquid and more volatile wholesale markets  credit quality deterioration of various industry participants  and the slowing of the us economy 
the energy markets also were affected by other significant events  including expanded investigations by state and federal authorities into business practices of energy companies in the deregulated power and gas markets relating to wash trading to inflate revenues and volumes  and other trading practices designed to manipulate market prices 
in addition  several merchant energy businesses significantly reduced their energy trading activities due to deteriorating credit quality 
during  the energy markets continued to be highly volatile with significant changes in natural gas and power prices  as well as the continuation of reduced liquidity in the marketplace 
we continue to actively manage our credit portfolio to attempt to reduce the impact of a potential counterparty default 
we discuss our counterparty credit and other risks in more detail in the market risk section 
we also continue to examine plans to achieve our strategies and to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our liquidity 
we discuss our liquidity in the financial condition section 
electric competition we are facing competition in the sale of electricity in wholesale power markets and to retail customers 
maryland as a result of the deregulation of electric generation in maryland  the following occurred effective july  all customers can choose their electric energy supplier 
bge provides fixed price standard offer service over various time periods for different classes of customers that do not select an alternative supplier until june  while bge does not sell electric commodity to all customers in its service territory  bge does deliver electricity to all customers and provides meter reading  billing  emergency response  regular maintenance  and balancing services 
bge provides a market rate standard offer service for those commercial and industrial customers who are no longer eligible for fixed price standard offer service 
bge residential base rates will not change before july while total residential base rates remain unchanged over the initial transition period july  through june   annual standard offer service rate increases are offset by corresponding decreases in the competitive transition charge ctc that bge receives from its customers 
commercial and industrial customers have several service options that will fix electric energy rates through june  and the ctc through june  bge transferred  at book value  its generating assets and related liabilities to the merchant energy business 
standard offer service our wholesale marketing and risk management operation is providing bge with of the energy and capacity required to meet its commercial and industrial standard offer service obligations through june  and of the energy and capacity required to meet its residential standard offer service obligations through june  bge will obtain its supply for standard offer service to its commercial and industrial customers beginning july   and to its residential customers beginning july   through a competitive wholesale bidding process as discussed in the standard offer service provider of last resort polr section below 
our wholesale marketing and risk management operation obtains the energy and capacity to supply bge s standard offer service obligations from our merchant energy operating plants in the pjm interconnection pjm region  supplemented with energy and capacity purchased from the wholesale market  as necessary 
beginning july   the fixed price standard offer service rate ended for certain of our large commercial and industrial customers 
as a result  the majority of these customers purchase their electricity from alternate suppliers  including subsidiaries of constellation energy 
the remaining large commercial and industrial customers that continue to receive their electric supply from bge are charged market based standard offer service rates through june  beginning july   all other commercial and industrial customers that receive their electric supply from bge will be charged market based standard offer service rates 
beginning july   bge s current obligation to provide fixed price standard offer service to residential customers ends and all residential customers that receive their electric supply from bge will be charged market based standard offer service rates 
standard offer service provider of last resort polr in april  the maryland public service commission maryland psc approved a settlement agreement reached by bge and parties representing customers  industry  utilities  suppliers  the maryland energy administration  the maryland psc s staff  and the office of people s counsel which  among other things  extends bge s obligation to supply standard offer service for a second transition period 
under the settlement agreement  bge is obligated to provide market based standard offer service for a second transition period to residential customers until june   and for commercial and industrial customers for a one  two or four year period beyond june   depending on customer load 
the polr rates charged during this time will recover bge s wholesale power supply costs and include an administrative fee 
in september  the maryland psc approved a second settlement agreement 
this phase deals with the bid procurement process that utilities must follow to obtain wholesale power supply to serve retail customers on standard offer service during the second transition period 
the settlement contains a model request for proposals  a model wholesale power supply contract  and various requirements pertaining to  among other things  bidder qualifications and bid evaluation criteria 
bidding to supply bge s standard offer service to commercial and industrial customers beyond june   began in february the same bidding procedures will be used for supplying bge s standard offer service to residential customers for the period after june  other states several states  other than maryland  have supported deregulation of the electric industry 
the pace of deregulation in other states varies based on historical moves to competition and responses to recent market events 
certain states that were considering deregulation have slowed their plans or postponed consideration 
in addition  other states are reconsidering deregulation 
our merchant energy business is also affected by regional regulatory or legislative decisions  which may impact our financial results and our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy 
in response to regional market differences and to promote competitive markets  the ferc proposed initiatives promoting the formation of regional transmission organizations and a standard market design 
if approved  these market changes could provide additional opportunities for our merchant energy business 
we discuss these initiatives in the ferc regulation regional transmission organizations and standard market design section 
gas competition the wholesale price of natural gas is not subject to regulation 
all bge gas customers have the option to purchase gas from alternate suppliers 
regulation by the maryland psc in addition to electric restructuring which was discussed earlier  regulation by the maryland psc influences bge s businesses 
the maryland psc determines the rates that bge can charge customers for the electric distribution and gas businesses 
the maryland psc incorporates into bge s electric rates the transmission rates determined by ferc 
bge s electric rates are unbundled to show separate components for delivery service  competitive transition charges  standard offer service generation  transmission  universal service  and certain taxes 
the rates for bge s regulated gas business continue to consist of a base rate and a fuel rate 
base rate the base rate is the rate the maryland psc allows bge to charge its customers for the cost of providing them service  plus a profit 
bge has both an electric base rate and a gas base rate 
higher electric base rates apply during the summer when the demand for electricity is higher 
gas base rates are not affected by seasonal changes 
bge may ask the maryland psc to increase base rates from time to time 
the maryland psc historically has allowed bge to increase base rates to recover increased utility plant asset costs and higher operating costs  plus a profit  beginning at the time of replacement 
generally  rate increases improve our utility earnings because they allow us to collect more revenue 
however  rate increases are normally granted based on historical data  and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs 
other parties may petition the maryland psc to decrease base rates 
as a result of the deregulation of electric generation in maryland  bge s residential electric base rates are frozen until electric delivery service rates are frozen until for commercial and industrial customers 
the generation and transmission components of rates are frozen for different time periods depending on the service options selected by those customers 
we discuss the impact on base rates beyond in the electric competition maryland section 
gas fuel rate we charge our gas customers separately for the natural gas they purchase from us 
the price we charge for the natural gas is based on a market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss market based rates and a proceeding with the maryland psc in more detail in the regulated gas business gas cost adjustments section and in note ferc regulation regional transmission organizations and standard market design in  bge turned over the operation of its transmission facilities to pjm  a power pool in the mid atlantic region 
in december  ferc issued order  amending its regulations under the federal power act to advance the formation of regional transmission organizations rtos that would allow easier access to transmission 
pjm received ferc approval of its rto status in december pending certain compliance filings 
on july   the ferc issued a proposed rulemaking regarding implementation of a standard market design smd for wholesale electric markets 
the smd rulemaking is intended to complement ferc s rto order  and would require rtos to substantially comply with its provisions 
the smd proposals also required transmission providers to turn over the operation of their facilities to an independent operator that will operate them consistent with a revised market structure proposed by the ferc 
according to the ferc  the revised market structure will reduce inefficiencies caused by inconsistent market rules and barriers to transmission access 
the ferc proposed that its rule be implemented in stages by october  comments on the smd proposal were submitted in february in april  the ferc issued a report that indicated its position with respect to the proposed rulemaking and announced that it intends to leave relatively unmodified existing rto practices  to allow flexibility among regional approaches  to allow phased in implementation of the final rule  and to provide an increased deference to states concerns 
concurrently  proposed federal legislation has been introduced that would remand the rulemaking process to ferc  require the issuance of a new notice of proposed rulemaking  and delay the issuance of a final rule until at least january  we believe that  while the original smd proposal would have led to uniform rules that would have been largely favorable to constellation energy and bge  the revised regional approach should result in improved market operations across various regions 
the proposed federal legislation does not appear to exclude a regional approach to market development 
overall  the trend continues to be toward increased competition in the regions 
the region where bge operates is expected to be relatively unaffected by this proceeding  based on current compliance by the pjm with the smd proposal 
weather merchant energy business weather conditions in the different regions of north america influence the financial results of our merchant energy business 
weather conditions can affect the supply of and demand for electricity and fuels  and changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot market and the forward market that may affect our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy 
typically  demand for electricity and its price are higher in the summer and the winter  when weather is more extreme 
similarly  the demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter 
however  all regions of north america typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time 
bge weather affects the demand for electricity and gas for our regulated businesses 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand 
mild weather reduces demand 
weather affects residential sales more than commercial and industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and gas 
however  the maryland psc allows bge to record a monthly adjustment to our regulated gas business revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns 
we discuss this further in the regulated gas business weather normalization section 
bge measures the weather s effect using degree days 
the measure of degree days for a given day is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of degrees 
cooling degree days result when the average daily actual temperature exceeds the degree baseline  adjusted for humidity levels 
heating degree days result when the average daily actual temperature is less than the baseline 
during the cooling season  hotter weather is measured by more cooling degree days and results in greater demand for electricity to operate cooling systems 
during the heating season  colder weather is measured by more heating degree days and results in greater demand for electricity and gas to operate heating systems 
we show the number of cooling and heating degree days in and  the percentage change in the number of degree days from the prior year  and the number of degree days in a normal year as represented by the year average in the following table year average cooling degree days  percentage change from prior year heating degree days    percentage change from prior year other factors a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for our merchant energy business 
these factors include seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand  number of market participants  extreme peak demands  available supply resources  transportation and transmission availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  implementation of new market rules governing operations of regional power pools  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
other factors  aside from weather  also impact the demand for electricity and gas in our regulated businesses 
these factors include the number of customers and usage per customer during a given period 
we use these terms later in our discussions of regulated electric and gas operations 
in those sections  we discuss how these and other factors affected electric and gas sales during the periods presented 
the number of customers in a given period is affected by new home and apartment construction and by the number of businesses in our service territory 
usage per customer refers to all other items impacting customer sales that cannot be measured separately 
these factors include the strength of the economy in our service territory 
when the economy is healthy and expanding  customers tend to consume more electricity and gas 
conversely  during an economic downtrend  our customers tend to consume less electricity and gas 
environmental and legal matters you will find details of our environmental matters in note and item business environmental matters section 
you will find details of our legal matters in note some of the information is about costs that may be material to our financial results 
accounting standards adopted and issued we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income  our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates 
the securities and exchange commission sec issued disclosure guidance for accounting policies that management believes are most critical 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management believes the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec 
we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates  in note revenue recognition mark to market method of accounting our merchant energy business enters into contracts for energy  other energy related commodities  and related derivatives 
we record merchant energy business revenues using two methods of accounting accrual accounting and mark to market accounting 
we describe our use of accrual accounting including hedge accounting in more detail in note we record revenues using the mark to market method of accounting for derivative contracts for which we are not permitted to use accrual accounting or hedge accounting 
these mark to market activities include derivative contracts for energy and other energy related commodities 
under the mark to market method of accounting  we record the fair value of these derivatives as mark to market energy assets and liabilities at the time of contract execution 
we record the changes in mark to market energy assets and liabilities on a net basis in nonregulated revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
mark to market energy assets and liabilities consist of a combination of energy and energy related derivative contracts 
while some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
the market prices and quantities used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimate considering various factors 
however  future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
we record reserves to reflect uncertainties associated with certain estimates inherent in the determination of the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities 
the effect of these uncertainties is not incorporated in market price information or other market based estimates used to determine fair value of our mark to market energy contracts 
to the extent possible  we utilize market based data together with quantitative methods for both measuring the uncertainties for which we record reserves and determining the level of such reserves and changes in those levels 
we describe below the main types of reserves we record and the process for establishing each 
generally  increases in reserves reduce our earnings  and decreases in reserves increase our earnings 
however  all or a portion of the effect on earnings of changes in reserves may be offset by changes in the value of the underlying positions 
close out reserve this reserve represents the estimated cost to close out or sell to a third party open mark to market positions 
this reserve has the effect of valuing long positions at the bid price and short positions at the offer price 
we compute this reserve using a market based estimate of the bid offer spread for each commodity and option price and the absolute quantity of our net open positions for each year 
to the extent that we are not able to obtain market information for similar contracts  the close out reserve is equivalent to the initial contract margin  thereby resulting in no gain or loss at inception 
the level of total close out reserves increases as we have larger unhedged positions  bid offer spreads increase  or market information is not available  and it decreases as we reduce our unhedged positions  bid offer spreads decrease  or market information becomes available 
credit spread adjustment for risk management purposes  we compute the value of our mark to market energy assets and liabilities using a risk free discount rate 
in order to compute fair value for financial reporting purposes  we adjust the value of our mark to market energy assets to reflect the credit worthiness of each counterparty based upon published credit ratings  where available  or equivalent internal credit ratings and associated default probability percentages 
we compute this reserve by applying the appropriate default probability percentage to our outstanding credit exposure  net of collateral  for each counterparty 
the level of this reserve increases as our credit exposure to counterparties increases  the maturity terms of our transactions increase  or the credit ratings of our counterparties deteriorate  and it decreases when our credit exposure to counterparties decreases  the maturity terms of our transactions decrease  or the credit ratings of our counterparties improve 
market prices for energy and energy related commodities vary based upon a number of factors  and changes in market prices affect both the recorded fair value of our mark to market energy contracts and the level of future revenues and costs associated with accrual basis activities 
changes in the value of our mark to market energy contracts will affect our earnings in the period of the change  while changes in forward market prices related to accrual basis revenues and costs will affect our earnings in future periods to the extent those prices are realized 
we cannot predict whether  or to what extent  the factors affecting market prices may change  but those changes could be material and could affect us either favorably or unfavorably 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the market risk section 
in october  the eitf reached a consensus on issue this consensus prohibits mark to market accounting for energy related contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
as a result  we began to account for all non derivative contracts on the accrual basis of accounting effective january  as described in note the consensus also prohibits recording unrealized gains or losses at the inception of derivative contracts unless the fair value of each contract in its entirety is evidenced by quoted market prices or other current market transactions for contracts with similar terms and counterparties  and it requires gains and losses on derivative energy trading contracts whether realized or unrealized to be reported as revenue on a net basis in the income statement 
eitf affects the timing of recognizing earnings on non derivative transactions 
in general  beginning in earnings on non derivative transactions subject to eitf are no longer recognized at the inception of the transactions as they were under mark to market accounting because they are subject to accrual accounting and are recognized over the term of the transaction 
as a result  while total earnings over the term of a transaction are the same as they would have been under mark to market accounting  our reported earnings for contracts subject to eitf generally match the cash flows from those contracts more closely 
additionally  because we record revenues and costs on a gross basis under accrual accounting  our revenues and costs increased  but our earnings have not been affected by gross versus net reporting 
the impact of derivative contracts on our revenues and costs is affected by many factors  including our ability to designate and qualify derivative contracts for normal purchase and sale accounting or hedge accounting under sfas no 
 potential volatility in earnings from derivative contracts that serve as economic hedges but do not meet the accounting requirements to qualify for normal purchase and sale accounting or hedge accounting  our ability to enter into new mark to market derivative origination transactions  and sufficient liquidity and transparency in the energy markets to permit us to record gains at inception of new derivative contracts because fair value is evidenced by quoted market prices  current market transactions  or other observable market information 
we discuss the impact of mark to market accounting on our financial results in the results of operations merchant energy business section 
evaluation of assets for impairment and other than temporary decline in value long lived assets we are required to evaluate certain assets that have long lives for example  generating property and equipment and real estate to determine if they are impaired when certain conditions exist 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  provides the accounting for impairments of long lived assets 
we are required to test our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes are a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition  an adverse action by a regulator or in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset  a current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses  or a change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used  sfas no 
provides that an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable under sfas no 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
therefore  when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets 
this necessarily involves judgment surrounding the inherent uncertainty of future cash flows 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  we consider historical cash flows  as well as reflect our understanding of the extent to which future cash flows will be either similar to or different from past experience based on all available evidence 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our other earnings forecasts 
if we are considering alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset such as the potential sale of an asset  we probability weight the alternative courses of action to estimate the cash flows 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
for long lived assets that can be classified as assets to be disposed of by sale under sfas no 
 an impairment loss is recognized to the extent their carrying amount exceeds their fair value  including costs to sell 
if we determine that the undiscounted cash flows from an asset to be held and used are less than the carrying amount of the asset  or if we have classified an asset as held for sale  we must estimate fair value to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
the estimation of fair value under sfas no 
 whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset to be disposed of by sale  also involves judgment 
we consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available 
in the absence of such information  we may consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
often  we will discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes 
the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as discussed above with respect to undiscounted cash flows 
actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
we are also required to evaluate our equity method and cost method investments for example  in partnerships that own power projects to determine whether or not they are impaired 
accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  provides the accounting for these investments 
the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under apb no 
is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than a temporary decline in value 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments under the apb no 
standard involves the same uncertainties as described above for long lived assets that we own directly and account for in accordance with sfas no 
similarly  the estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subject to variation  and the impact of such variations could be material 
additionally  if the projects in which we hold these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 we would record our proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate our investment for an other than temporary decline in value under apb no 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill and certain other intangibles under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires us to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the business might be impaired 
goodwill is impaired if the carrying value of the business exceeds fair value 
annually  we estimate the fair value of the businesses we have acquired using techniques similar to those used to estimate future cash flows for long lived assets as discussed above  which involves judgment 
if the estimated fair value of the business is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is required to be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill is greater than its fair value 
asset retirement obligations we incur legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain long lived assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  provides the accounting for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
we incur such legal obligations as a result of environmental and other government regulations  contractual agreements  and other factors 
the application of this standard requires significant judgment due to the large number and diverse nature of the assets in our various businesses and the estimation of future cash flows required to measure legal obligations associated with the retirement of specific assets 
sfas no 
requires the use of an expected present value methodology in measuring asset retirement obligations that involves judgment surrounding the inherent uncertainty of the probability  amount and timing of payments to settle these obligations  and the appropriate interest rates to discount future cash flows 
we use our best estimates in identifying and measuring our asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
our nuclear decommissioning costs represent our largest asset retirement obligation 
this obligation primarily results from the requirement to decommission and decontaminate the calvert cliffs and nine mile point plants in connection with their future retirement 
we revised our site specific decommissioning cost estimates as part of the process to determine our nuclear asset retirement obligations 
however  given the magnitude of the amounts involved  complicated and ever changing technical and regulatory requirements  and the very long time horizons involved  the actual obligation could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
significant events of in  we recorded the following special items in earnings pre tax after tax in millions workforce reduction costs impairment losses and other costs net gain on sales of investments and other assets total special items workforce reduction costs during  we recorded costs of million pre tax  or million after tax  of which bge recorded million pre tax  associated with deferred payments to employees eligible for the voluntary special early retirement program 
impairment losses and other costs in  our other nonregulated businesses recognized an impairment loss of million pre tax  or million after tax  related to the decline in value of our investment in an airplane that we sold in january in the fourth quarter of  we began re evaluating our strategy regarding ourgeothermal generating facility in hawaii 
this facility has property  plant and equipment with a net book value of approximately million 
if we ultimately dispose of the geothermal facility  the actual proceeds received could be less than the carrying value of the plant  resulting in a loss that could be material 
we discuss this in further detail in the merchant energy business other section on page net gain on sales of investments and other assets during  our other nonregulated businesses recognized million of pre tax  or million after tax  gains on the sales of non core assets as follows a million pre tax gain on the sale of several parcels of real estate  a million pre tax gain on the sale of an oil tanker to the us navy  a million pre tax gain on the favorable settlement of a contingent obligation we had previously reserved relating to the sale of our guatemalan power plant operation in the fourth quarter of  and a million pre tax gain on the sale of financial investments 
we discuss our and special items in more detail in note hurricane isabel in september  hurricane isabel caused damage to the electric and gas distribution systems of bge 
as a result  during  bge incurred capitalized costs of million and maintenance expenses of million pre tax  or million after tax to restore its distribution system 
the maintenance expenses included million pre tax  or million after tax  of incremental expenses 
generating facility commenced operations in april  our high desert power project in victorville  california  an megawatt mw gas fired combined cycle facility  commenced operations 
the project has a long term power sales agreement with the california department of water resources cdwr 
the contract is a tolling structure  under which the cdwr pays a fixed amount of million per month and provides cdwr the right  but not the obligation  to purchase power from the project at a price linked to the variable cost of production 
during the term of the contract  which runs for seven years and nine months from the april commercial operation date of the plant  the project will provide energy exclusively to the cdwr 
prior to june  we accounted for this project as an operating lease 
in june  we exercised our option to pay off the lease  acquired the assets from the lessor  and included the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we describe the net assets acquired in note we include the results of the high desert power project in our merchant energy business segment 
acquisitions during  our merchant energy business acquired the following energy contract portfolios customer load serving contracts representing mw and corresponding supply portfolio from a subsidiary of cms energy corp  and the load serving contract and related hedges from allegheny energy supply company  llc to provide of the standard offer service to bge for the period from july  through june  on october   we purchased blackhawk energy services blackhawk and kaztex energy management kaztex 
blackhawk and kaztex are providers of natural gas and electricity products throughout illinois and wisconsin  serving approximately  customers representing approximately billion cubic feet of natural gas and million megawatt hours of electricity 
we acquired ownership of both companies for million 
we acquired cash of million as part of the purchase 
we describe the net assets acquired in note we include the results of blackhawk and kaztex in our merchant energy business segment beginning on the date of acquisition 
in addition  as part of our growth strategy  our merchant energy business had other acquisitions including a synthetic fuel facility in south carolina  various competitive energy supply contract portfolios with commercial and industrial customers  certain gas contracts and a wholesale marketing business in canada 
planned acquisition on november   we announced an agreement with rochester gas and electric rg e to acquire the re ginna nuclear power plant ginna located north of rochester  new york 
upon closing the acquisition of this mw facility  we will own and operate three nuclear power stations 
the estimated purchase price for the ginna plant is million  excluding approximately million for purchased nuclear fuel 
rg e will transfer approximately million in decommissioning funds at the time of closing 
we believe this transfer will be sufficient to meet the decommissioning requirements of the facility 
the transaction is contingent upon regulatory approvals  including license extension 
the acquisition includes a long term unit contingent power purchase agreement where we will sell of the plant s output and capacity to rg e for years at an average price of per mwh 
the remaining of the plant s output will be managed by our wholesale marketing and risk management operation and will be sold into the wholesale market 
synthetic fuel tax credits we have investments in facilities that manufacture solid synthetic fuel produced from coal as defined under section of the internal revenue code for which we claim tax credits on our federal income tax return 
we recognize the tax benefit of these credits in our consolidated statements of income when we believe it is highly probable that the credits will be sustained 
the synthetic fuel process involves combining coal material with a chemical reagent to create a significant chemical change 
a taxpayer may request a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs to support its position that the synthetic fuel produced undergoes a significant chemical change and thus qualifies for section credits 
as of december   we have recognized cumulative tax benefits associated with section credits of million  of which million was recognized during the year ended december  these credits relate to our minority ownership interest in four synthetic fuel facilities located in ohio  virginia and west virginia 
these facilities have received private letter rulings from the irs 
in january  the irs concluded its examination of the partnership that owns these facilities for the tax years through and the irs did not disallow any of the previously recognized synthetic fuel credits 
we are awaiting final written notice of the resolution of the examination from the irs 
in  we purchased ownership in a south carolina facility that produces synthetic fuel 
on january   we submitted our request for a private letter ruling to the irs for our south carolina facility 
our south carolina facility is using the same synthetic fuel process that was utilized by the previous owner  which had received a private letter ruling 
to date  we have not yet received our private letter ruling from the irs for our south carolina facility 
since we may not rely upon a private letter ruling issued by the irs to another taxpayer  we have not recognized the tax benefit of approximately million for these credits in our consolidated statements of income during we have the option under the amended purchase agreement for this facility to terminate our participation  without penalty  by april  we are currently evaluating our strategy regarding this facility and have not decided whether we will end our participation 
while we believe the production and sale of synthetic fuel from all of our synthetic fuel facilities meet the conditions to qualify for tax credits under section of the irs code  we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any future challenge by the irs  legislative or regulatory action  or the ultimate impact of such events on the section credits that we have claimed to date or expect to claim in the future  but the impact could be material to our financial results 
calvert cliffs extended outage in april  our merchant energy business completed the unit steam generator replacement and refueling outage at calvert cliffs 
this outage was completed in days  fewer days than a similar outage completed at calvert cliff s unit in june dividend increase in january  we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from cents to cents per share on our common stock payable april  to holders of record on march  this is equivalent to an annual rate of per share 
results of operations in this section  we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them 
we begin with a general overview  then separately discuss net income for our operating segments 
significant changes in other income  fixed charges  and income taxes are discussed in the aggregate for all segments in the consolidated nonoperating income and expenses section 
overview results in millions  after tax merchant energy regulated electric regulated gas other nonregulated net income before cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles net income special items included in operations net gain on sales of investments and other assets workforce reduction costs impairments of real estate  senior living  and other investments impairments of investment in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects costs associated with exit of bge home merchandise stores contract termination related costs total special items our total net income for decreased million  or per share  compared to mostly because of the following we recorded a million after tax  or per share  charge for the cumulative effect of adopting eitf this was partially offset by a million after tax  or per share  gain for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
we discuss these cumulative effect items in more detail in note we recognized a million after tax  or per share  gain on the sale of our investment in orion in that had a positive impact in that period 
we discuss the sale of orion in more detail in note we had higher expenses in our wholesale competitive supply activities relating to the expansion of our wholesale operations  higher operating costs at our generation facilities  and other inflationary pressures 
we had higher fixed charges due to lower capitalized interest and a higher level of debt outstanding as a result of refinancing our high desert power project 
our results reflect the impact of the shift to accrual accounting under eitf specifically  the absence of mark to market gains for contracts accounted for on an accrual basis in and the timing difference in the recognition of earnings for certain economic hedges  which we discuss further in the competitive supply mark to market revenues section  were only partially offset by the recognition of accrual earnings on transactions entered into in prior periods 
our regulated electric business incurred distribution service restoration expenses associated with hurricane isabel 
these decreases were partially offset by the following we had higher earnings from wholesale competitive supply activities resulting from effective portfolio management  partially offset by lower mark to market origination in we had higher earnings from favorable generating plant operational performance 
specifically  our high desert power project commenced operations in april and calvert cliffs completed a steam generator replacement in april  fewer days than a similar outage that was completed in june we had higher workforce reduction costs in that had a negative impact in the period 
we realized cost reductions due to productivity initiatives 
we had higher earnings from the acquisition of alliance and from a full year of newenergy 
we had higher earnings from our regulated business  excluding the impacts of hurricane isabel 
our other nonregulated business recognized a gain of million after tax  or per share  in related to non core asset sales 
we had higher earnings from our other nonregulated businesses primarily related to improved operations of our international portfolio 
we recognized impairments of certain investments in qualifying facilities  real estate  and other investments in that had a negative impact in that period 
we had costs associated with our exit of bge home merchandise stores in that had a negative impact in that period 
our total net income for increased million  or per share  compared to mostly because of the following we recognized a million after tax gain  or per share  on the sale of our investment in orion 
we recorded special items in that had a negative impact in that year 
we had cost reductions due to productivity initiatives associated with our corporate wide workforce reduction and other productivity programs 
the addition of nine mile point nuclear station nine mile point to the generation fleet increased net income 
we benefited from the absence of goldman sachs fees due to the termination of the power business services agreement in october we discuss the goldman sachs termination in more detail in note we had higher mark to market earnings from our wholesale marketing and risk management operation 
we had higher earnings from our regulated electric business because of warmer summer weather in the central maryland region 
we had higher earnings from the addition of newenergy 
we had higher earnings from our other nonregulated businesses due to the growth of our energy services business and improved results from our international portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by special items recorded in and the following we had higher fixed charges due to the issuance of billion of long term debt that was primarily used to repay short term borrowings and due to lower capitalized interest because of the new generating facilities that commenced operations since mid our merchant energy business had higher purchased fuel costs 
we had lower earnings due to the extended outage at calvert cliffs to replace the steam generators at unit our merchant energy business had lower earnings due to the impact of large commercial and industrial customers leaving bge s standard offer service and electing other generation suppliers resulting in the sale of excess generation at lower wholesale market prices 
our merchant energy business had lower earnings from our investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects 
in addition  our other nonregulated businesses recorded the following in that had a positive impact in that period an million after tax  or per share  gain for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 and gains on the sale of securities of million after tax  or per share 
earnings per share contributions from all of our business segments were impacted by the dilution resulting from the issuance of million of common shares during merchant energy business background our merchant energy business is a competitive provider of energy solutions for large customers in north america 
we discuss the impact of deregulation on our merchant energy business in the business environment electric competition section 
we record merchant energy revenues and expenses in our financial results in different periods depending upon which portion of our business they affect 
we discuss our revenue recognition policies in the critical accounting policies section and in note we summarize our policies as follows we record revenues as they are earned and fuel and purchased energy costs as they are incurred for contracts and activities subject to accrual accounting  including certain load serving activities 
prior to the settlement of the forecasted transaction being hedged  we record changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are effective 
we record the effective portion of the changes in fair value of hedges in earnings in the period the settlement of the hedged transaction occurs 
we record the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value of hedges  if any  in earnings in the period in which the change occurs 
we record changes in the fair value of contracts that are subject to mark to market accounting in revenues on a net basis in the period in which the change occurs 
mark to market accounting requires us to make estimates and assumptions using judgment in determining the fair value of our contracts and in recording revenues from those contracts 
we discuss the effects of mark to market accounting on our revenues in the competitive supply mark to market revenues section 
we discuss mark to market accounting and the accounting policies for the merchant energy business further in the critical accounting policies section and in note in the first quarter of  we adopted eitf  which requires non derivative contracts to be accounted for on the accrual basis and recorded in our consolidated statements of income gross rather than net 
the primary contracts affected were our full requirements load serving contracts and unit contingent power purchase contracts 
the majority of these contracts were in texas and new england and were entered into prior to our shift to accrual accounting earlier in we discuss our shift to accrual accounting during in more detail in the competitive supply accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses section 
we discuss the adoption of eitf in more detail in note after the re designation of existing contracts to non trading  we record revenues and expenses on a gross basis  but this does not have a material impact on earnings because the resulting increase in revenues is accompanied by a similar increase in fuel and purchased energy expenses 
eitf affects the timing of recognizing earnings on non derivative transactions 
earnings on new non derivative transactions subject to eitf are no longer recognized at the inception of the transactions as they were under mark to market accounting because they are subject to accrual accounting and are recognized over the term of the transaction 
additionally  we expect lower earnings volatility for this portion of our business because unrealized changes in the fair value of non derivative load serving contracts will no longer be recorded as revenue at the time of the change as they were under mark to market accounting

note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses our merchant energy business manages the revenues we realize from the sale of energy to our customers and our costs of procuring fuel and energy 
the difference between revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses is the primary driver of the profitability of our merchant energy business 
accordingly  we believe it is appropriate to discuss the operating results of our merchant energy business by analyzing the changes in the relationship between revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses 
in managing our portfolio  we occasionally terminate  restructure  or acquire contracts 
such transactions are within the normal course of managing our portfolio and may materially impact the timing of our recognition of revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses 
we discuss non fuel direct costs  such as ancillary services  transmission costs  brokerage fees  and legal costs in conjunction with other operations and maintenance expenses later in the operations and maintenance expenses section 
we analyze our merchant energy revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses in the following categories because of the risk profile of each category  differences in the revenue sources  and the nature of fuel and purchased energy expenses 
with the exception of a portion of our competitive supply activities that we are required to account for using the mark to market method of accounting  all of these activities are accounted for on an accrual basis 
mid atlantic fleet our fossil  nuclear  and hydroelectric generating facilities and load serving activities in the pjm interconnection pjm region for which the output is primarily used to serve bge 
this also includes active portfolio management of the generating assets and associated physical and financial arrangements 
plants with power purchase agreements our generating facilities with long term power purchase agreements  including our nine mile point nuclear station nine mile point  oleander  university park  and high desert facilities 
competitive supply our wholesale marketing and risk management operation that provides energy products and services to distribution utilities and other wholesale customers 
we also provide electric and gas energy services to retail commercial and industrial customers 
we began to manage our gas fired facilities in the mid west region  which were previously part of our other category  as part of our competitive supply activities beginning in the second quarter of this occurred in connection with the acquisition of the load serving customers from cms energy corp  as previously discussed in the significant events of section 
other our investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects and our generation and consulting services 
we provide a summary of our revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses as follows dollar amounts in millions revenues mid atlantic fleet    plants with power purchase agreements competitive supply  other total    fuel and purchased energy expenses mid atlantic fleet plants with power purchase agreements competitive supply  other total   revenues less fuel and purchased energy expenses of total of total of total mid atlantic fleet plants with power purchase agreements competitive supply other total    certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year s presentation 
mid atlantic fleet in millions revenues    fuel and purchased energy expenses revenues less fuel and purchased energy expenses revenues we provide the changes in mid atlantic fleet revenues compared to the respective prior years in the following table vs 
vs 
in millions bge s standard offer service bge home electric sales other total increase the decreases for both periods in bge s standard offer service revenues were mostly due to approximately  mw of large commercial and industrial customers leaving bge s standard offer service in the second quarter of and electing other electric generation suppliers 
in compared to  the decrease was partially offset by higher volumes sold due to warmer summer weather 
approximately one third of the load for large commercial and industrial customers that left bge s standard offer service elected bge home  a subsidiary of constellation energy  as their electric generation supplier 
our merchant energy business continues to provide the energy to bge home to meet the requirements of these customers under market based rates 
beginning in the second quarter of  as contracts for large commercial and industrial customers being served by bge home expire  the renewal of any customer will be with newenergy  our subsidiary which provides electric and gas energy services to commercial and industrial customers and which is included in our competitive supply category 
other mid atlantic fleet revenues increased million during compared to the increase is primarily due to the following higher sales of energy and related services from our owned generation in excess of that used to serve bge s standard offer service  including our active portfolio management of these generating assets and associated physical and financial arrangements  a gain on the assumption of the allegheny load serving contract for the remaining of the bge standard offer service load  and increased sales to bge home related to their gas programs 
other mid atlantic fleet revenues were about the same in compared to fuel and purchased energy expenses our merchant energy business had higher fuel and purchased energy expenses for the mid atlantic fleet in compared to primarily due to the following higher generation costs related to the increased sales of energy and related services from our owned generation in excess of that used to serve bge s standard offer service  and increased costs related to increased sales to bge home related to their gas programs 
our merchant energy business had higher fuel and purchased energy expenses for the mid atlantic fleet in compared to primarily due to higher replacement power costs from the extended outage at calvert cliffs and higher coal prices 
these were partially offset by lower generation at our coal plants 
plants with power purchase agreements in millions revenues fuel and purchased energy expenses revenues less fuel and purchased energy expenses the increases in revenues during compared to were primarily due to revenues of million from high desert that commenced operations in the second quarter of  higher revenues of million from the oleander generating facility which commenced operations late in the second quarter of  and higher revenues of million from nine mile point because there were fewer forced outage days in as compared to our plants with purchase power agreements had higher fuel and purchased energy expenses in due to the operation of high desert and the oleander facilities 
the increases in revenues and expenses during compared to were primarily due to a full year s results from nine mile point  which we acquired in november  and the university park generating facility  which commenced operations in the second half of in addition  the oleander generating facility commenced operations in the second half of competitive supply in millions accrual revenues  mark to market revenues fuel and purchased energy expenses  revenues less fuel and purchased energy expenses we analyze our accrual and mark to market competitive supply activities separately below 
accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses we provide the changes in revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses in compared to and in compared to in the following table vs 
vs 
increases in fuel and purchased energy expenses increases in revenues increases in revenues increases in fuel and purchased energy expenses in millions wholesale accrual activities   acquisitions   total increase   our accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses increased in compared to mostly because of the re designation of our load serving activities to accrual  including the adoption of eitf  combined with increased wholesale accrual origination activities  primarily in texas and new england  and the acquisitions of newenergy and alliance 
our accrual revenues also increased due to additional product and service offerings  and includes approximately million of pre tax gains on contract restructurings 
we discuss the implications of eitf in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note our accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses increased in primarily due to the re designation of our texas and new england load serving activities to accrual and the acquisition of newenergy in september we discuss the re designation of texas and new england below 
since february  we manage our texas load serving activities as a physical delivery business separate from our trading activities and re designated these activities as non trading 
we believe this designation more accurately reflects the substance of our texas load serving physical delivery activities 
at the time of this change in designation  we reclassified the fair value of load serving contracts and physically delivering power purchase agreements in texas from mark to market energy assets and liabilities to other assets and liabilities 
the contracts reclassified consisted of gross assets of million and gross liabilities of million  or a net asset of million 
eitf subsequently required us to remove the unamortized balance of these assets and liabilities  excluding the costs of any acquired contracts  from our consolidated balance sheets on january  after the change in designation  the results of our texas load serving activities are included in nonregulated revenues on a gross basis as power is delivered to our customers and operating expenses as costs are incurred 
prior to the re designation  the results of these activities were reported on a net basis as part of mark to market revenues included in nonregulated revenues 
mark to market revenues for the texas trading activities were a net loss of million for the portion of prior to designation as non trading 
mark to market revenues for the texas trading activities were a net loss of million in since future power sales revenues and costs from these activities are reflected in our consolidated statements of income as part of nonregulated revenues when power is delivered and operating expenses when the costs are incurred  this re designation generally delays the recognition of earnings from these activities compared to what we would have recognized under mark to market accounting 
the change in designation of our texas load serving activities did not impact our cash flows 
in addition  our new england load serving activities consists primarily of contracts to serve the full energy and capacity requirements of retail customers and electric distribution utilities and associated power purchase agreements to supply our customers requirements 
we manage these activities primarily to assure profitable delivery of customers energy requirements rather than as a traditional trading activity 
therefore  we use accrual accounting for new england load serving transactions and associated power purchase agreements entered into since the second quarter of because applicable accounting rules significantly limited the circumstances under which contracts previously designated as a trading activity could be re designated as non trading  prior to eitf  we were required to continue to include contracts entered into before the second quarter of in our mark to market accounting portfolio 
however  under eitf  on january   we removed these contracts from our mark to market energy assets and liabilities and began to account for these contracts under the accrual method of accounting 
mark to market revenues mark to market revenues include net gains and losses from origination and risk management activities for which we use the mark to market method of accounting 
we discuss these activities and the mark to market method of accounting in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note we also discuss the implications of eitf on the mark to market method of accounting in the critical accounting policies section and in note as a result of the nature of our operations and the use of mark to market accounting for certain activities  mark to market revenues and earnings will fluctuate 
we cannot predict these fluctuations  but the impact on our revenues and earnings could be material 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the market risk section 
the primary factors that cause fluctuations in our mark to market revenues and earnings are the number  size  and profitability of new transactions  the number and size of our open derivative positions  and changes in the level and volatility of forward commodity prices and interest rates 
mark to market revenues were as follows in millions unrealized revenues origination gains risk management unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total risk management total unrealized revenues realized revenues total mark to market revenues origination gains arise from contracts that our wholesale marketing and risk management operation structure to meet the risk management needs of our customers 
transactions that result in origination gains may be unique and provide the potential for individually significant revenues and gains from a single transaction 
origination gains represent the initial fair value recognized on these structured transactions 
the recognition of origination gains is dependent on the existence of observable market data that validates the initial fair value of the contract 
for the year ending december   origination gains contributed million before tax 
origination gains arose from transactions completed in  of which no transaction individually contributed in excess of million pre tax 
the amount of origination gains decreased significantly as compared to due to the implementation of eitf as noted above the recognition of origination gains is dependent on sufficient observable market data 
liquidity and market conditions impact our ability to identify sufficient  objective market price information to permit recognition of origination gains 
as a result  while our strategy and competitive position provide the opportunity to continue to originate such transactions  the level of origination revenue we are able to recognize may vary from year to year as a result of the number  size  and market price transparency of the individual transactions executed in any period 
risk management revenues represent both realized and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the value of our entire portfolio 
we discuss the changes in mark to market revenues below 
we show the relationship between our revenues and the change in our net mark to market energy asset later in this section 
our mark to market revenues were and continue to be affected by a decrease in the portion of our activities that is subject to mark to market accounting 
as previously discussed in the accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy section  we re designated our texas load serving activities as accrual during  and we began to account for new non derivative origination transactions on the accrual basis rather than under mark to market accounting 
beginning january   under eitf  we no longer record existing non derivative contracts at fair value 
further  effective july   to the extent that we are not able to observe quoted market prices or other current market transactions for contract values determined using models  we record a reserve to adjust such contracts to result in zero gain or loss at inception 
we remove the reserve and record such contracts at fair value when we obtain current market information for contracts with similar terms and counterparties 
mark to market revenues decreased million in compared to mostly because of lower revenues from origination transactions  net losses from risk management activities compared to net gains in the prior year  and the reclassification of revenues from settled contracts to realized revenues 
the lower level of origination transactions primarily reflects the continuing reduction of the portion of our activities subject to mark to market accounting 
the decrease in risk management revenues is primarily due to mark to market revenue associated with the restructuring of our high desert contract with the cdwr that had a positive impact in  unfavorable changes in regional power prices  price volatility  and the impact of mark to market losses on economic hedges that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment as discussed in more detail below 
with the implementation of eitf in the first quarter of  all of our load serving contracts were converted to accrual accounting 
however  several economically effective hedges on these positions did not qualify for accrual accounting treatment under sfas no 
and remained in the mark to market portfolio 
in  increasing forward prices shifted value between accrual load serving positions and associated mark to market hedges producing a timing difference in the recognition of earnings on related transactions 
as a result  we recorded a million pre tax loss on the mark to market hedges during this mark to market loss will be offset by the end of as we realize the related accrual load serving positions in cash 
mark to market revenues increased million during compared to mostly because of net gains from risk management activities compared to net losses in the prior year  partially offset by lower revenues from origination transactions 
the increase in risk management revenues is primarily due to the absence of mark to market losses recorded in on texas trading activities designated as non trading in  favorable changes in regional power prices  price volatility  and other factors in compared to the decrease in origination revenues reflects the use of accrual accounting for new load serving transactions originated beginning in the second quarter of  the impact of applying the eitf guidance on recording gains at the time of contract origination as previously described in the critical accounting policies section  and fewer individually significant transactions in as compared to mark to market energy assets and liabilities our mark to market energy assets and liabilities are comprised of derivative contracts  and in  prior to the implementation of eitf  were comprised of a combination of derivative and non derivative physical contracts 
the non derivative assets and liabilities primarily related to load serving activities originated prior to the shift to accrual accounting in while some of our mark to market contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we discuss our modeling techniques later in this section 
mark to market energy assets and liabilities consisted of the following at december  in millions current assets noncurrent assets total assets  current liabilities noncurrent liabilities total liabilities  net mark to market energy asset the following are the primary sources of the change in net mark to market energy asset during and in millions fair value beginning of year changes in fair value recorded as revenues origination gains unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total changes in fair value recorded as revenues cumulative effect impact of eitf contracts designated as normal purchases sales and hedges upon implementation of eitf contract exchange changes in fair value recorded as operating expenses changes in value of exchange listed futures and options net change in premiums on options texas contracts re designated as non trading other changes in fair value fair value at end of year changes in the net mark to market energy asset that affected revenues were as follows origination transactions represent the initial unrealized fair value at the time these contracts are executed to the extent permitted by applicable accounting rules  including eitf effective january  unrealized changes in fair value represent unrealized changes in commodity prices  the volatility of options on commodities  the time value of options  and other valuation adjustments 
changes in valuation techniques represent improvements in estimation techniques  including modeling and other statistical enhancements used to value our portfolio to reflect more accurately the economic value of our contracts 
reclassification of settled contracts to realized represents the portion of previously unrealized amounts settled during the period and recorded as realized revenues 
the net mark to market energy asset also changed due to the following items recorded in accounts other than revenue the cumulative effect impact of eitf represents the non derivative portion of the net asset that was removed from our consolidated balance sheets as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january  as required by eitf contracts designated as normal purchases sales and hedges upon implementation of eitf represents the portion of the net asset reclassified to other assets or liabilities under the normal purchases normal sales provisions of sfas no 
or risk management assets or liabilities under the cash flow hedge provisions of sfas no 
in connection with the implementation of eitf effective january  contract exchange represents the fair value of a contract previously included in mark to market energy assets that we terminated in a nonmonetary exchange with a counterparty 
at that time  we also terminated a hedge contract with the same counterparty that was recorded in risk management liabilities 
in exchange  we entered into a new cash flow hedge transaction with the counterparty that we recorded at an amount equal to the fair value of the terminated contracts 
changes in fair value recorded as operating expenses represent accruals for future incremental expenses in connection with servicing origination transactions 
while these accruals are recorded as part of the fair value of the net mark to market energy asset  they are reflected in our consolidated statements of income as expenses rather than revenues 
changes in value of exchange listed futures and options are adjustments to remove unrealized revenue from exchange traded contracts that are included in risk management revenues 
the fair value of these contracts is recorded in accounts receivable rather than mark to market energy assets in our consolidated balance sheets because these amounts are settled through our margin account with a third party broker 
net changes in premiums on options reflects the accounting for premiums on options purchased as an increase in the net mark to market energy asset and premiums on options sold as a decrease in the net mark to market energy asset 
we discuss our texas contracts re designated as non trading in more detail in the competitive supply section 
the settlement terms of our net mark to market energy asset and sources of fair value as of december  are as follows settlement term fair value thereafter in millions prices provided by external sources prices based on models total net mark to market energy asset includes contracts actively quoted and contracts valued from other external sources 
we manage our mark to market risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of our contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract 
accordingly  we record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under our contracts in separate components based upon the commodity eg  electricity or gas  the product eg  electricity for delivery during peak or off peak hours  the delivery location eg  by region  the risk profile eg  forward or option  and the delivery period eg  by month and year 
consistent with our risk management practices  we have presented the information in the table above based upon the ability to obtain reliable prices for components of the risks in our contracts from external sources rather than on a contract by contract basis 
thus  the portion of long term contracts that is valued using external price sources is presented under the caption prices provided by external sources 
this is consistent with how we manage our risk  and we believe it provides the best indication of the basis for the valuation of our portfolio 
since we manage our risk on a portfolio basis rather than contract by contract  it is not practicable to determine separately the portion of long term contracts that is included in each valuation category 
we describe the commodities  products  and delivery periods included in each valuation category in detail below 
the amounts for which fair value is determined using prices provided by external sources represent the portion of forward  swap  and option contracts for which price quotations are available through brokers or over the counter transactions 
the term for which such price information is available varies by commodity  region  and product 
the fair values included in this category are the following portions of our contracts forward purchases and sales of electricity during peak hours for delivery terms primarily through  but up to  depending upon the region  forward purchases and sales of electricity during off peak hours for delivery terms primarily through  but up to  depending upon the region  options for the purchase and sale of electricity during peak hours for delivery terms through  depending upon the region  forward purchases and sales of electric capacity for delivery terms through  forward purchases and sales of natural gas  coal and oil for delivery terms through  and options for the purchase and sale of natural gas  coal and oil for delivery terms through the remainder of the net mark to market energy asset is valued using models 
the portion of contracts for which such techniques are used includes standard products for which external prices are not available and customized products that are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
modeling techniques include estimating the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms and incorporate  where appropriate  option pricing models and statistical and simulation procedures 
inputs to the models include observable market prices  estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  the risk free market discount rate  volatility factors  estimated correlation of energy commodity prices  and expected generation profiles of specific regions 
additionally  we incorporate counterparty specific credit quality and factors for market price and volatility uncertainty and other risks in our valuation 
the inputs and factors used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimates 
the electricity  fuel  and other energy contracts we hold have varying terms to maturity  ranging from contracts for delivery the next hour to contracts with terms of ten years or more 
because an active  liquid electricity futures market comparable to that for other commodities has not developed  the majority of contracts used in the wholesale marketing and risk management operation are direct contracts between market participants and are not exchange traded or financially settling contracts that can be readily liquidated in their entirety through an exchange or other market mechanism 
consequently  we and other market participants generally realize the value of these contracts as cash flows become due or payable under the terms of the contracts rather than through selling or liquidating the contracts themselves 
consistent with our risk management practices  the amounts shown in the table on the previous page as being valued using prices from external sources include the portion of long term contracts for which we can obtain reliable prices from external sources 
the remaining portions of these long term contracts are shown in the table as being valued using models 
in order to realize the entire value of a long term contract in a single transaction  we would need to sell or assign the entire contract 
if we were to sell or assign any of our long term contracts in their entirety  we may not realize the entire value reflected in the table 
however  based upon the nature of the wholesale marketing and risk management operation  we expect to realize the value of these contracts  as well as any contracts we may enter into in the future to manage our risk  over time as the contracts and related hedges settle in accordance with their terms 
we do not expect to realize the value of these contracts and related hedges by selling or assigning the contracts themselves in total 
the fair values in the table represent expected future cash flows based on the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of december  and could change significantly as a result of future changes in these factors 
additionally  because the depth and liquidity of the power markets vary substantially between regions and time periods  the prices used to determine fair value could be affected significantly by the volume of transactions executed 
management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts it holds and sells 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
other in millions revenues our merchant energy business holds up to a ownership interest in operating domestic energy projects that consist of electric generation  fuel processing  or fuel handling facilities 
of these projects  are qualifying facilities that receive certain exemptions and pricing under the public utility regulatory policy act of based on the facilities energy source or the use of a cogeneration process 
in addition  we own of a geothermal generating facility in hawaii 
earnings from our investments were million in  million in and million in the decrease in revenues in compared to was due to lower revenues from our california projects because we reversed certain credit reserves that totaled million during the first quarter of  as we began receiving payments from the california utilities  which had a positive impact in  partially offset by a geothermal project generating at a higher capacity in the decrease in revenues in compared to was due to a geothermal project generating at a lower capacity and lower revenues from our california projects 
at december   our investment in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects consisted of the following book value at december  in millions project type coal hydroelectric geothermal biomass fuel processing solar total during  we acquired the minority interest from our partner in a geothermal project and removed the equity method investment in the project and consolidated the assets and liabilities of the project in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the current market conditions for our equity method investments that own geothermal  coal  hydroelectric  and fuel processing projects provide sufficient positive cash flows to recover our investments 
we continuously monitor issues that potentially could impact future profitability of these investments  including environmental and legislative initiatives 
we discuss certain risks and uncertainties in more detail in our forward looking statements section 
however  should future events cause these investments to become uneconomic  our investments in these projects could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
currently  we are re evaluating our strategy regarding our geothermal generating facility  which we obtained control by purchasing our partner s interest in december upon obtaining control  we removed our equity method investment and included the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   this generating facility had property  plant and equipment with a net book value of approximately million 
the reevaluation of our strategy has included soliciting bids to determine the level of interest in the project  and if we determine that offers to purchase the project would provide more attractive cash flows than under our current hold and use strategy  we may decide to dispose of the project 
while we have not completed the reevaluation of our strategy  based upon the number and level of bids received  management has determined that disposal of the project is more likely than not to occur 
as a result  we evaluated our facility for impairment as of december   in accordance with sfas no 
 and determined that the assets were not impaired 
we expect to complete the reevaluation of our strategy in the first half of  and if we ultimately dispose of the plant  the actual proceeds received could be less than the carrying value of the plant resulting in a loss that could be material 
the ability to recover our costs in our equity method investments that own biomass and solar projects is partially dependent upon subsidies from the state of california 
under the california public utility act  subsidies currently exist in that the california public utilities commission cpuc requires electric corporations to identify a separate rate component to fund the development of renewable resources technologies  including solar  biomass  and wind facilities 
in addition  recently enacted legislation in california requires that each electric corporation increase its total procurement of eligible renewable energy resources by at least one percent per year so that of its retail sales are procured from eligible renewable energy resources by the legislation also requires the california energy commission to award supplemental energy payments to electric corporations to cover above market costs of renewable energy 
given the need for electric power and the desire for renewable resource technologies  we believe california will continue to subsidize the use of renewable energy to make these projects economical to operate 
however  should the california legislation fail to adequately support the renewable energy initiatives  our equity method investments in these types of projects could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
 and any losses recognized could be material 
if our strategy were to change from an intent to hold to an intent to sell for any of our equity method investments in qualifying facilities or power projects  we would need to adjust their book value to fair value  and that adjustment could be material 
if we were to sell these investments in the current market  we may have losses that could be material 
operations and maintenance expenses our merchant energy business operations and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to mostly due to the following an increase of million due to the acquisitions of newenergy in september and alliance in december  an increase in costs related to our wholesale marketing and risk management operation as a result of growth of this operation  an increase of million at nine mile point  including higher costs associated with the refueling outage of unit in compared to the refueling outage of unit since we own of unit  we incurred all outage costs compared to of costs for unit  costs of million related to our high desert facility that commenced operations in the second quarter of  and higher compensation and other inflationary costs 
these increases were partially offset by cost reductions due to productivity initiatives including our corporate wide workforce reduction programs 
our merchant energy business operations and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to mostly due to the following an increase of million associated with the acquisitions of nine mile point in november and newenergy in september  and an increase of million associated with new generating facilities that commenced operations beginning in mid and mid these increases were partially offset by the following a decrease of million due to productivity initiatives associated with our corporate wide workforce reduction and other productivity programs  and lower origination and risk management operating expenses of million as a result of the absence of goldman sachs fees due to the termination of the power business services agreement in october the goldman sachs fees were million in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with the growth of the operation 
workforce reduction costs  impairment losses and other costs  contract termination related costs  and net loss on sales of assets our merchant energy business recognized expenses associated with our workforce reduction efforts  impairment losses and other costs  contract termination related costs  and a net loss on sales of assets as discussed in more detail in note depreciation and amortization expense merchant energy depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in compared to mostly because of the adoption of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 a portion of the decommissioning amortization is included as accretion of asset retirement obligations expense beginning in as discussed below 
in addition  beginning in we no longer include the expected net future costs of removal as a component of depreciation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense related to new generating facilities that commenced operations in mid and high desert that commenced operations in merchant energy depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to mostly because of the depreciation and amortization associated with nine mile point and the new generating facilities that commenced operations in mid and mid accretion of asset retirement obligations on january   we adopted sfas no 
that requires the accretion of the asset retirement obligation liability due to the passage of time until the liability is settled 
accordingly  we recognized million of accretion expense in we discuss sfas no 
in note taxes other than income taxes merchant energy taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to mostly because of gross receipt taxes associated with newenergy and property taxes on new generating facilities 
merchant energy taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to mostly because of taxes other than income taxes associated with nine mile point and the new generating facilities 
regulated electric business as discussed in the electric competition maryland section  our regulated electric business was significantly impacted by the july  implementation of customer choice 
effective july   bge unbundled its rates to show separate components for delivery service  transition charges  standard offer service generation  transmission  universal service  and taxes 
bge s rates also were frozen in total except for the implementation of a residential base rate reduction totaling approximately million annually 
in addition  of the ctc revenues bge collects and the portion of its revenues providing for decommissioning costs  are included in revenues of the merchant energy business 
as part of the deregulation of electric generation  while total rates were frozen over the transition period  the increasing rates received from customers under the standard offer service are offset by declining ctc rates

net income from the regulated electric business increased in compared to mostly because of lower workforce reduction costs  lower interest expense  and cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives 
these favorable results were partially offset by distribution service restoration expenses related to hurricane isabel and other major storms in total distribution service restoration expenses related to hurricane isabel were million after tax  which included million after tax of incremental expenses 
net income from the regulated electric business increased in compared to mostly because of the following increased distribution sales volumes due to warmer summer weather  increased usage per customer  and an increased number of customers  cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives  and lower interest expense 
electric revenues the changes in electric revenues in and compared to the respective prior year were caused by in millions distribution sales volumes standard offer service fuel rate surcharge total change in electric revenues from electric system sales other total change in electric revenues distribution sales volumes distribution sales volumes are sales to customers in bge s service territory at rates set by the maryland psc 
the percentage changes in our electric system sales volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial in  we distributed about the same amount of electricity to residential customers compared to we distributed more electricity to commercial customers mostly due to increased usage per customer 
we distributed less electricity to industrial customers mostly due to lower usage by industrial customers 
in  we distributed more electricity to residential and commercial customers compared to due to warmer summer weather  increased usage per customer  and an increased number of customers 
we distributed about the same amount of electricity to industrial customers in compared to standard offer service bge provides standard offer service for customers that do not select an alternative generation supplier as discussed in the electric competition maryland section 
standard offer service revenues decreased in compared to and decreased in compared to mostly because a majority of bge s large commercial and industrial customers left standard offer service in the second quarter of and elected other electric generation suppliers 
in  these decreased revenues were partially offset by an increase in the standard offer service rate that bge charges its customers 
in  these decreased revenues were partially offset by increased sales to residential customers mostly due to warmer summer weather and an increase in the standard offer service rate that bge charges its customers 
as a result of large commercial and industrial customers leaving bge s standard offer service  bge had lower purchased energy expense as discussed in the electric fuel and purchased energy expenses section 
electric fuel and purchased energy expenses in millions actual costs    recovery of costs deferred under electric fuel rate clause total electric fuel and purchased energy expenses   actual costs as discussed in the business environment electric competition section  effective july   bge transferred its generating assets to  and began purchasing substantially all of the energy and capacity required to provide electricity to standard offer service customers from  our merchant energy business 
bge s actual costs of electricity purchased for resale expenses decreased in compared to and decreased in compared to mostly because large commercial and industrial customers left bge s standard offer service and elected other electric generation suppliers as previously discussed in the standard offer service section 
electric operations and maintenance expenses regulated electric operations and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to mostly because of distribution service restoration expenses related to hurricane isabel of million  which includes million of non incremental labor expenses  and distribution service restoration expenses related to other major storms 
this increase also reflects higher benefit and inflationary costs  partially offset by lower uncollectible expenses and cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives 
regulated electric operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to mostly due to cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives 
workforce reduction costs bge s electric business recognized expenses associated with our workforce reduction efforts as discussed in note electric depreciation and amortization expense regulated electric depreciation and amortization expense increased in compared to mostly because of accelerated amortization associated with the planned replacement of information technology assets 
regulated electric depreciation and amortization expense was about the same during compared to regulated gas business all bge customers have the option to purchase gas from other suppliers 
to date  customer choice has not had a material effect on our  or bge s  financial results

note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
net income from our regulated gas business increased during compared to mostly because of the reinstatement of a million pre tax regulatory asset following an order issued by the maryland psc  and the approval of million pre tax of property tax refund claims by the state of maryland resulting from a reclassification of gas distribution pipeline from real property to personal property 
net income from our regulated gas business decreased during compared to mostly because of a million pre tax disallowed portion of a previously established regulatory asset as discussed in the gas cost adjustments section and a million pre tax decrease in the shareholders portion of the sharing mechanism under our gas cost adjustment clauses 
gas revenues the changes in gas revenues in and compared to the respective prior year were caused by in millions distribution sales volumes base rates weather normalization gas cost adjustments total change in gas revenues from gas system sales off system sales other total change in gas revenues distribution sales volumes the percentage changes in our distribution sales volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial we distributed more gas to residential and commercial customers during compared to mostly due to colder winter weather  an increased number of customers and increased usage per customer 
we distributed less gas to industrial customers mostly due to decreased usage per customer 
we distributed more gas to residential and commercial customers during compared to mostly due to increased usage per customer  slightly colder weather  and an increased number of customers 
we distributed less gas to industrial customers mostly because of a decreased number of customers 
weather normalization the maryland psc allows us to record a monthly adjustment to our gas revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns on our gas system sales volumes 
this means our monthly gas revenues are based on weather that is considered normal for the month and  therefore  are not affected by actual weather conditions 
gas cost adjustments we charge our gas customers for the natural gas they purchase from us using gas cost adjustment clauses set by the maryland psc as described in note however  under market based rates  our actual cost of gas is compared to a market index a measure of the market price of gas in a given period 
the difference between our actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers 
the shareholders portion was about the same during as compared to the shareholders portion decreased million during compared to effective november  the maryland psc approved an order that modifies certain provisions of the market based rates incentive mechanism 
these provisions require that bge secure fixed price contracts for at least  but not more than  of forecasted system supply requirements for the november through march period 
these fixed price contracts are not subject to sharing under the market based rates incentive mechanism 
delivery service customers are not subject to the gas cost adjustment clauses because we are not selling gas to them 
we charge these customers fees to recover the fixed costs for the transportation service we provide 
these fees are the same as the base rate charged for gas distributed and are included in gas distribution sales volumes 
gas cost adjustment revenues increased during as compared to because we sold more gas at a higher price 
gas cost adjustment revenues decreased during compared to mostly because the gas we sold to non delivery service customers was at a lower price  partially offset by more gas sold 
in december  a hearing examiner from the maryland psc issued a proposed order disallowing million of a previously established regulatory asset for certain credits that were over refunded to customers through our market based rates 
bge reserved the million of disallowed fuel costs in the fourth quarter of in august  the maryland psc issued an order authorizing us to recover the million and we reinstated the regulatory asset 
off system sales off system gas sales are low margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas outside our service territory 
off system gas sales  which occur after we have satisfied our customers demand  are not subject to gas cost adjustments 
the maryland psc approved an arrangement for part of the margin from off system sales to benefit customers through reduced costs and the remainder to be retained by bge which benefits shareholders 
changes in off system sales do not significantly impact earnings 
revenues from off system gas sales increased during compared to because we sold gas at a higher price  partially offset by less gas sold 
revenues from off system gas sales decreased during compared to because we sold less gas at a lower price 
gas purchased for resale expenses gas purchased for resale expenses include the cost of gas purchased for resale to our customers and for off system sales 
these costs do not include the cost of gas purchased by delivery service customers 
gas costs increased during as compared to mostly because we purchased more gas at a higher price 
gas costs decreased during compared to because we purchased gas at a lower price partially offset by the million of disallowed fuel costs as previously discussed in the gas cost adjustments section 
gas operations and maintenance expenses regulated gas operations and maintenance expenses decreased million during as compared to mostly because of lower uncollectible expenses and cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives 
regulated gas operations and maintenance expenses were about the same during compared to in  cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives were offset by the amortization of gas regulatory assets established in related to these initiatives

net income from our other nonregulated businesses decreased million during compared to mostly because we recognized a million after tax gain on the sale of our investment in orion in that had a positive impact in that period 
this decrease was partially offset by the following transactions a million pre tax gain on the sale of several parcels of real estate  a million pre tax charge associated with the exit of bge home merchandise stores in which had a negative impact in that period  a million pre tax gain on the sale of an oil tanker to the us navy  a million pre tax gain on the favorable settlement of a contingent obligation we had previously reserved relating to the sale of our guatemalan power plant operation in the fourth quarter of  a million pre tax gain on the sale of financial investments  and improved results from our international portfolio 
net income from our other nonregulated businesses increased million during compared to mostly because of the following we recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in orion in we recorded impairment losses and other costs in that had a negative impact in that year 
we recognized a loss on the sale of our guatemalan operations in that had a negative impact in that year 
we had higher earnings due to the growth of our energy services business and improved results from our international portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by the following we recognized gains on the sale of securities in that had a positive impact in that year  including the million pre tax gain on the sale of one million shares of our orion investment and million pre tax gains on the sale of securities by our financial investments operation 
we recorded million of pre tax costs associated with the exit of bge home merchandise stores in we recorded impairment losses of million pre tax related to certain non core assets in we discuss our special items further in note in addition  we recognized an million after tax  or per share  gain for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
in the first quarter of we decided to sell certain non core assets and accelerate the exit strategies on other assets that we will continue to hold and own over the next several years 
these assets included approximately  acres of land holdings in various stages of development located in seven sites in the central maryland region  an operating waste water treatment plant located in anne arundel county  maryland  all of our senior living facilities and certain international power projects 
in  we sold approximately acres of land holdings  all of our senior living facilities  and a south american generating facility 
at december   our remaining land holdings total approximately acres 
our remaining projects are partially or substantially developed 
our strategy is to hold and in some cases further develop these projects to increase their value 
however  if we were to sell these projects in the current market  we may have losses that could be material  although the amount of the losses is hard to predict 
in addition  we initiated a liquidation program for our financial investments operation 
through december   we have liquidated approximately of our investment portfolio 
while our intent is to dispose of these remaining non core assets  market conditions and other events beyond our control may affect the actual sale of these assets 
in addition  a future decline in the fair value of these assets could result in additional losses 
consolidated nonoperating income and expenses other income other income decreased million during compared to mostly because of lower interest income on temporary cash investments and higher earnings from consolidated investments where our ownership is less than  which resulted in increased minority interest expense 
other income increased million during compared to mostly because of interest income on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund transferred in connection with the acquisition of nine mile point and income on temporary cash investments 
other income for bge decreased million in as compared to mostly because of an increase in charitable contributions and because of lower interest income on temporary cash investments in the constellation energy cash pool 
other income for bge increased million during compared to mostly because of interest income on temporary cash investments in the constellation energy cash pool 
fixed charges total fixed charges increased million during compared to mostly because we had lower capitalized interest due to our new generating facilities commencing operations and a higher level of debt outstanding  including the issuance of million of debt in june that was used to refinance the high desert power project lease 
total fixed charges increased million during compared to mostly because of a higher level of debt outstanding at higher interest rates and lower capitalized interest due to our new generating facilities commencing operations 
in  we issued billion of long term debt and used the proceeds to repay short term borrowings  to prepay the nine mile point sellers note  and to fund acquisitions 
total fixed charges for bge decreased million during compared to mostly because of a lower level of debt outstanding and lower interest rates 
total fixed charges for bge decreased million during as compared to mostly because of a lower level of debt outstanding due to the repayment of maturing long term debt 
income taxes the differences in income taxes result from a combination of the changes in income and the effective tax rate 
we include an analysis of the changes in the effective tax rate in note pension expense our actual return on our qualified pension plan assets was for the year ended december  we assume an expected return on pension plan assets of for the purpose of computing annual net periodic pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
differences between actual and expected returns are deferred along with other actuarial gains and losses and reflected in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
expected and actual returns on pension assets also are affected by plan contributions 
in  we contributed million to our pension plans 
as of the date of this report  we contributed an additional million to our pension plans in at december   we recorded an after tax increase to equity of million as a result of decreasing our additional minimum pension liability 
we discuss our pension plans in more detail in note financial condition cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows by business segment  as well as our consolidated cash flows for   and this table excludes the impact of the refinancing of the high desert power project and the impact of changes in intercompany balances 
we exclude the impact of the high desert refinancing due to the fact that there was no net impact on cash

overview compared to cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities were million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in proceeds from the sale of non core assets of million in compared to we discuss our sales of orion and copt in note excluding the impact of these non core asset sales  cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities were as follows change in millions cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities less cash flows from sale of investments and other assets net the million increase in compared to was primarily due to lower investments in property  plant and equipment of million  lower cash used for acquisitions  excluding high desert  of million  and an increase in cash provided by operating activities of million 
cash flows from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was  million in compared to  million in and million in non cash adjustments to net income were million higher in compared to the increase in non cash adjustments to net income was primarily due to the following cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles of million as a result of the adoption of sfas no

the ratings indicate the agencies assessment of each company s ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends  and principal on these securities 
these ratings affect how much it will cost each company to sell these securities 
the better the rating  the lower the cost of the securities to each company when they sell them 
the factors that credit rating agencies consider in establishing constellation energy s and bge s credit ratings include  but are not limited to  cash flows  liquidity  and the amount of debt as a component of total capitalization 
all constellation energy and bge credit ratings have stable outlooks 
at the date of this report  our credit ratings were as follows standard poors rating group moody s investors service fitch ratings constellation energy commercial paper a p f senior unsecured debt bbb baa a bge commercial paper a p f mortgage bonds a a a senior unsecured debt bbb a a trust preferred securities bbb a a preference stock bbb baa a available sources of funding we continuously monitor our liquidity requirements and believe that our facilities and access to the capital markets provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business requirements 
we discuss our available sources of funding in more detail below 
constellation energy in addition to our cash balance  we have a commercial paper program under which we can issue short term notes to fund our subsidiaries 
at december   we had approximately billion of credit under three facilities as discussed below 
in june  constellation energy arranged a million day revolving credit facility and a million three year revolving credit facility replacing a maturing million day revolving credit facility and a maturing million three year revolving credit facility 
we also have an existing million revolving credit facility that expires in june we use these facilities to allow the issuance of commercial paper 
in addition  we use the multi year facilities to allow for the issuance of letters of credit 
these revolving credit facilities allow the issuance of letters of credit up to approximately billion 
at december   letters of credit that totaled million were issued under all of our facilities  which results in approximately billion of unused credit facilities 
bge bge maintains million in annual committed credit facilities  expiring may through november  in order to allow commercial paper to be issued 
as of december   bge had no outstanding commercial paper  which results in million in unused credit facilities 
other nonregulated businesses bge home products services maintains a program to sell up to million of receivables 
we expect to extend this program beyond the current expiration date in march if we can get a reasonable value for our remaining real estate projects and other investments  additional cash may be obtained by selling them 
our ability to sell or liquidate assets will depend on market conditions  and we cannot give assurances that these sales or liquidations could be made 
capital resources our actual consolidated capital requirements for the years through  along with the estimated annual amount for  are shown in the table below 
we will continue to have cash requirements for working capital needs  payments of interest  distributions  and dividends  capital expenditures  and the retirement of debt and redemption of preference stock 
capital requirements for and include estimates of spending for existing and anticipated projects 
we continuously review and modify those estimates 
actual requirements may vary from the estimates included in the table below because of a number of factors including regulation  legislation  and competition  bge load requirements  environmental protection standards  the type and number of projects selected for construction or acquisition  the effect of market conditions on those projects  the cost and availability of capital  and the availability of cash from operations

capital requirements merchant energy business our merchant energy business capital requirements consist of its continuing requirements  including construction expenditures for improvements to generating plants  nuclear fuel costs  costs of complying with the environmental protection agency epa  maryland  and pennsylvania nitrogen oxides nox emissions regulations  and enhancements to our information technology infrastructure 
we discuss the nox regulations and timing of expenditures in note regulated electric and gas regulated electric and gas construction expenditures primarily include new business construction needs and improvements to existing facilities  including projects to improve reliability 
capital requirements for in the table on the previous page include million in costs incurred as a result of hurricane isabel to restore the electric distribution system 
funding for capital requirements merchant energy business funding for the expansion of our merchant energy business is expected from internally generated funds 
we also have available sources from commercial paper issuances  issuances of long term debt and equity  leases  and other financing activities 
the projects that our merchant energy business develops typically require substantial capital investment 
most of the projects recently constructed were funded through corporate borrowings by constellation energy 
many of the qualifying facilities and independent power projects that we have an interest in are financed primarily with non recourse debt that is repaid from the project s cash flows 
this debt is collateralized by interests in the physical assets  major project contracts and agreements  cash accounts and  in some cases  the ownership interest in that project 
we expect to fund acquisitions  including ginna  with a mixture of debt and equity with an overall goal of maintaining a strong investment grade credit profile 
funding for this acquisition is expected to occur during bge funding for utility capital expenditures is expected from internally generated funds 
during  we expect our regulated utility business to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet bge s operating requirements 
if necessary  additional funding may be obtained from commercial paper issuances  available capacity under credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  trust preferred securities  or preference stock  and or from time to time equity contributions from constellation energy 
bge also participates in a cash pool administered by constellation energy as discussed in note other nonregulated businesses funding for our other nonregulated businesses is expected from internally generated funds  commercial paper issuances  issuances of long term debt of constellation energy  sales of securities and assets  and or from time to time equity contributions from constellation energy 
bge home products services can continue to fund capital requirements through sales of receivables 
our ability to sell or liquidate securities and non core assets will depend on market conditions  and we cannot give assurances that these sales or liquidations could be made 
we discuss our remaining non core assets and market conditions in the results of operations other nonregulated businesses section 
contractual payment obligations and committed amounts we enter into various agreements that result in contractual payment obligations in connection with our business activities 
these obligations primarily relate to our financing arrangements such as long term debt  preference stock  and operating leases  purchases of capacity and energy to support the growth in our merchant energy business activities  and purchases of fuel and transportation to satisfy the fuel requirements of our power generating facilities 
our total contractual payment obligations as presented in the table on the next page increased billion during compared to primarily due to new presentation requirements resulting in the initial inclusion of interest payments of  million and postretirement and postemployment benefit obligations of million  higher purchased capacity and energy obligations of  million under new power purchase agreements associated with revenue generating contracts with customers due to the growth of our merchant energy business  and higher other purchase obligations of million  including newly executed turbine and software maintenance agreements

investors may require us to repay million early through put options and remarketing features 
contracts to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms 
amounts related to certain purchase obligations are based on future purchase expectations which may differ from actual purchases 
our contractual obligations for purchased capacity and energy are shown on a gross basis for certain transactions  including both the fixed payment portions of tolling contracts and estimated variable payments under unit contingent power purchase agreements 
we have recorded million of liabilities related to purchased capacity and energy obligations at december  in our consolidated balance sheets 
we have recorded liabilities of million related to fuel and transportation obligations at december  in our consolidated balance sheets 
amounts related to postretirement and postemployment benefits are for unfunded plans and reflect present value amounts consistent with the determination of the related liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as discussed in note the table below presents our contingent obligations 
our contingent obligations increased billion during  primarily due to the issuance of additional letters of credit and guarantees by the parent company of subsidiary obligations to third parties in support of the growth of our merchant energy business 
these amounts do not represent incremental consolidated constellation energy obligations  rather  they primarily represent parental guarantees of certain subsidiary obligations to third parties 
our calculation of the fair value of subsidiary obligations covered by the  million of parent company guarantees was million at december  accordingly  if the parent company was required to fund subsidiary obligations  the total amount at current market prices is million 
expiration thereafter total in millions contingent obligations letters of credit guarantees competitive supply  other guarantees  net total contingent obligations  while the face amount of these guarantees is  million  we do not expect to fund the full amount 
our calculation of the fair value of obligations covered by these guarantees was million at december  other guarantees in the above table are shown net of liabilities of million recorded at december  in our consolidated balance sheets 
liquidity provisions we have certain agreements that contain provisions that would require additional collateral upon significant credit rating decreases in the senior unsecured debt of constellation energy 
decreases in constellation energy s credit ratings would not trigger an early payment on any of our credit facilities 
however  under counterparty contracts related to our wholesale marketing and risk management operation  where we are obligated to post collateral  we estimate that we would have additional collateral obligations based on downgrades to the following credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt credit ratings downgraded level below current rating incremental obligations cumulative obligations in millions bbb baa bbb baa below investment grade at december   we had approximately billion of unused credit facilities and million of cash available to meet potential requirements 
however  based on market conditions and contractual obligations at the time of such a downgrade  we could be required to post collateral in an amount that could exceed the amounts specified above  and which could be material 
in many cases  customers of our merchant energy business rely on the creditworthiness of constellation energy 
a decline below investment grade by constellation energy would negatively impact the business prospects of that operation 
the credit facilities of constellation energy and bge have limited material adverse change clauses that only consider a material change in financial condition and are not directly affected by decreases in credit ratings 
if these clauses are violated  the lending institutions can decline to make new advances or issuing new letters of credit  but cannot accelerate existing amounts outstanding 
the long term debt indentures of constellation energy and bge do not contain material adverse change clauses or financial covenants 
certain credit facilities of constellation energy contain a provision requiring constellation energy to maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 
at december   the debt to capitalization ratios as defined in the credit agreements were no greater than 
certain credit agreements of bge contain provisions requiring bge to maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 
at december   the debt to capitalization ratio for bge as defined in these credit agreements was 
at december   no amount is outstanding under these agreements 
failure by constellation energy  or bge  to comply with these covenants could result in the maturity of the debt outstanding under these facilities being accelerated 
the credit facilities of constellation energy contain usual and customary cross default provisions that apply to defaults on debt by constellation energy and certain subsidiaries over a specified threshold 
certain bge credit facilities also contain usual and customary cross default provisions that apply to defaults on debt by bge over a specified threshold 
the indentures pursuant to which bge has issued and outstanding mortgage bonds and subordinated debentures provide that a default under any debt instrument issued under the relevant indenture may cause a default of all debt outstanding under such indenture 
constellation energy also provides credit support to calvert cliffs and nine mile point to ensure these plants have funds to meet expenses and obligations to safely operate and maintain the plants

such arrangements do not represent a significant part of our activities or a significant ongoing source of financing 
we use these arrangements when they enable us to obtain financing or execute commercial transactions on favorable terms 
as of december   we have no material off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees with third parties that are subject to the initial recognition and measurement requirements of fasb interpretation no

to manage our market risk  we may enter into various derivative instruments including swaps  forward contracts  futures contracts  and options 
in this section  we discuss our current market risk and the related use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through our issuance of variable rate and fixed rate debt

commodity risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas  coal  and other commodities 
these risks arise from our ownership and operation of power plants  the load serving activities of bge standard offer service and our competitive supply activities  and our mark to market origination and risk management activities 
we discuss these risks separately for our merchant energy and our regulated businesses below 
merchant energy business our merchant energy business is exposed to various risks in the competitive marketplace that may materially impact its financial results and affect our earnings 
these risks include changes in commodity prices  imbalances in supply and demand  and operations risk 
commodity prices commodity price risk arises from the potential for changes in the price of  and transportation costs for  electricity  natural gas  coal  and other commodities  the volatility of commodity prices  and changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the energy markets significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
we use such commodities and contracts in our merchant energy business  and if we do not properly hedge the associated financial exposure  this commodity price volatility could affect our earnings 
these factors include seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand  extreme peak demands due to weather conditions  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  location of our generating facilities relative to the location of our load serving obligations  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
as a result of declines in bge s standard offer service load and approximately  mw of natural gas fired peaking and combined cycle generating facilities placed in service between and  we have an amount of generating capacity that is subject to future changes in wholesale electricity prices 
additionally  we have fuel requirements that are subject to future changes in coal  natural gas  and oil prices 
our power generation facilities purchase fuel under contracts or on the spot market 
fuel prices may be volatile and the price that can be obtained from power sales may not change at the same rate or in the same direction as changes in fuel costs 
supply and demand risk we are exposed to the risk that available sources of supply may differ from the amount of power demanded by our customers under fixed price load serving contracts 
during periods of high demand  our power supplies may be insufficient to serve our customers needs and could require us to purchase additional energy at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand  our power supplies may exceed our customers needs and could result in us selling that excess energy at lower prices 
either of those circumstances could have a negative impact on our earnings 
operations risk operations risk is the risk that a generating plant will not be available to produce energy and the risks related to physical delivery of energy to meet our customers needs 
for  we expect to use the majority of the generating capacity controlled by our merchant energy business to provide standard offer service to bge or to serve the load requirements of the sellers of nine mile point 
if one or more of our generating facilities is not able to produce electricity when required due to operational factors  we may have to forego sales opportunities or fulfill fixed price sale commitments through the operation of other more costly generating facilities or through the purchase of energy in the wholesale market at higher prices 
our nuclear plants produce electricity at a relatively low marginal cost 
as a result  the costs of replacement energy associated with outages at these plants can be significant 
if an unplanned outage were to occur during the summer or winter when demand was at a high level  the replacement power costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
risk management as part of our overall portfolio  we manage the commodity price risk of our competitive supply activities and our electric generation facilities  including power sales  fuel and energy purchases  emission credits  weather risk  and the market risk of outages 
in order to manage these risks  we may enter into fixed price derivative or non derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel and energy  including forward contracts  which commit us to purchase or sell energy commodities in the future  futures contracts  which are exchange traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument  or to make a cash settlement  at a specific price and future date  swap agreements  which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual notional quantity  and option contracts  which convey the right to buy or sell a commodity  financial instrument  or index at a predetermined price 
the objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on our electric generation operations  fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of our power plants  and fixing the price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply our load serving customers 
the portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management s assessment of market  weather  operational  and other factors 
while some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and such variations could be material 
we monitor and manage our risk exposures through separate  but complementary financial  operational  risk  and credit reporting systems 
constellation energy s board of directors establishes parameters for the risks that we can undertake and risk levels are monitored daily by management and our chief risk officer 
in addition  we maintain segregation of duties with credit review and risk monitoring functions performed by groups that are independent from revenue producing groups 
we measure the sensitivity of our wholesale marketing and risk management mark to market energy contracts to potential changes in market prices using value at risk 
value at risk is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price volatility 
we calculate value at risk using a variance covariance technique that models option positions using a linear approximation of their value 
additionally  we estimate variances and correlation using historical commodity price changes over the most recent rolling three month period 
our value at risk calculation includes all wholesale marketing and risk management mark to market energy assets and liabilities  including contracts for energy commodities and derivatives that result in physical settlement and contracts that require cash settlement 
the value at risk calculation does not include market risks associated with activities that are subject to accrual accounting  primarily our generating facilities and our competitive supply load serving activities 
we manage these risks by monitoring our fuel and energy purchase requirements and our estimated contract sales volumes compared to associated supply arrangements 
we also engage in hedging activities to manage these risks 
we describe those risks and our hedging activities earlier in this section 
the value at risk amount represents the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of our wholesale marketing and risk management mark to market energy assets and liabilities over one and ten day holding periods 
our value at risk for and were as follows for the year ended december  in millions confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  one day holding period year end average high low confidence level  ten day holding period year end average high low based on a confidence interval  we would expect a one day change in the fair value of the portfolio greater than or equal to the daily value at risk approximately once in every days 
in  we experienced five instances where the actual daily mark to market change in portfolio value exceeded the predicted value at risk 
this is primarily attributable to higher volatility of power and fuel prices experienced during on average  we expect to experience a change in value to our portfolio greater than our value at risk approximately times in a calendar year 
however  published market studies conclude that exceeding daily value at risk less than times in a one year period is considered consistent with a confidence interval 
the table above is the value at risk associated with our wholesale marketing and risk management operation s mark to market energy assets and liabilities  including both trading and non trading activities 
the following table details our value at risk for the trading portion of our wholesale marketing and risk management mark to market energy assets and liabilities over a one day holding period at a confidence level for and at december  in millions average high due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as value at risk and the seasonality of changes in market prices  the value at risk calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure 
additionally  actual changes in the value of options may differ from the value at risk calculated using a linear approximation inherent in our calculation method 
as a result  actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated value at risk  and such changes could have a material impact on our financial results 
regulated electric business effective july   bge s residential base rates are frozen for a six year period  and its commercial and industrial base rates are frozen for a four year period 
the generation and transmission components of rates are frozen for different time periods depending on the service options selected by those customers 
we discuss the impact on base rates beyond in the electric competition maryland section 
our wholesale marketing and risk management operation provides bge with of the energy and capacity required to meet its commercial and industrial standard offer service obligations through june   and of the energy and capacity to meet its residential standard offer service obligations through june  bge will obtain its supply for standard offer service to its commercial and industrial customers beginning july   and to its residential customers beginning july   through a competitive wholesale bidding process as discussed in the electric competition standard offer service provider of last resort polr section 
bge may receive performance assurance collateral from suppliers to mitigate suppliers credit risks in certain circumstances 
performance assurance collateral is designed to protect bge s potential exposure over the term of the supply contracts and will fluctuate to reflect changes in market prices 
in addition to the collateral provisions  there are supplier step up provisions  where other suppliers can step in if the early termination of a full requirements service agreement with a supplier should occur  as well as specific mechanisms for bge to otherwise replace defaulted supplier contracts 
all costs incurred by bge to replace the supply contract are to be recovered from the defaulting supplier or from customers through rates 
finally  bge s exposure to uncollectible expense or credit risk from customers for the commodity portion of the bill is covered by the administrative fee included in polr rates 
regulated gas business our regulated gas business may enter into gas futures  options  and swaps to hedge its price risk under our market based rate incentive mechanism and our off system gas sales program 
we discuss this further in note at december  and  our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated gas business was not material 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk  primarily through our merchant energy business 
credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterparty s nonperformance 
we evaluate our credit risk for our wholesale marketing and risk management operation and our retail competitive supply activities separately as discussed below 
wholesale credit risk we measure wholesale credit risk as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative transactions both mark to market and accrual adjusted for amounts owed to or due from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses  where we have a legally enforceable right of setoff 
we monitor and manage the credit risk of our wholesale marketing and risk management operation through credit policies and procedures which include an established credit approval process  daily monitoring of counterparty credit limits  the use of credit mitigation measures such as margin  collateral  or prepayment arrangements  and the use of master netting agreements 
during  we continued to observe significant declines in the creditworthiness of several major participants in the wholesale energy markets 
we continue to actively manage the credit portfolio of our wholesale marketing and risk management operation to attempt to reduce the impact of the general decline in the overall credit quality of the energy industry and the impact of a potential counterparty default 
as of december  and  the credit portfolio of our wholesale marketing and risk management operation had the following public credit ratings at december  rating investment grade non investment grade not rated includes counterparties with an investment grade rating by at least one of the major credit rating agencies 
if split rating exists  the lower rating is used 
the reduction in the percentage of counterparties with investment grade ratings to in is primarily due to increased business activity with counterparties that do not have public credit ratings 
these not rated counterparties include governmental entities  municipalities  cooperatives  power pools  other load serving entities  and marketers for which we determine creditworthiness based on our internal credit ratings 
in addition to the credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies  we utilize internal credit ratings to evaluate the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers  including those companies that do not have public credit ratings 
the following table provides the breakdown of the credit quality of our wholesale credit portfolio based on our internal credit ratings 
at december  investment grade equivalent non investment grade a portion of our wholesale credit risk is related to transactions that are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
these transactions primarily consist of open positions from our wholesale marketing and risk management operation that are accounted for using mark to market accounting  as well as amounts owed by wholesale counterparties for transactions that settled but have not yet been paid 
the following table highlights the credit quality and exposures related to these activities rating total exposure before credit collateral credit collateral net exposure number of counterparties greater than of net exposure net exposure of counterparties greater than of net exposure dollars in millions investment grade split rating non investment grade internally rated investment grade internally rated non investment grade total due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the electricity our wholesale marketing and risk management operation had contracted for  we could incur a loss that could have a material impact on our financial results 
additionally  if a counterparty were to default and we were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  our credit loss would include the loss in value of mark to market contracts  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  we would have to make to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
retail credit risk we are exposed to retail credit risk through our competitive electricity and natural gas supply activities which serve commercial and industrial companies 
retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations 
this risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer s accounts receivable balance  as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer 
retail credit risk is managed through established credit policies  monitoring customer exposures  a diversified portfolio with no significant concentration customer or industry  and the use of credit mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements 
during  we did not experience a material change in the credit quality of our retail credit portfolio compared to retail credit quality is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes 
if the business environment were to be negatively affected by changes in economic or other market conditions  our retail credit risk may be adversely impacted 
equity price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets primarily through our pension plan assets  our nuclear decommissioning trust funds  trust assets securing certain executive benefits  and our financial investments operation 
we are required by the nrc to maintain an externally funded trust for the costs of decommissioning our nuclear power plants 
we discuss our nuclear decommissioning trust funds in more detail in note a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million reduction in the fair value of our financial investments that are classified as trading or available for sale securities 
in  the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets increased by approximately million due to advances in the markets in which plan assets are invested 
we describe our financial investments in more detail in note  and our pension plans in note item a
