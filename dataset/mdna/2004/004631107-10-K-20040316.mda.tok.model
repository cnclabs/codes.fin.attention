item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in march  we sold two of our stations  kplr tv serving the st 
louis marketplace and kwbp tv  serving the portland  oregon marketplace  to subsidiaries of the tribune company for an aggregate  all cash  consideration of million plus a payment for the closing date working capital of the st 
louis station in the amount of approximately million 
the results relating to these two stations have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the nine television stations that comprise our continuing operations are regionally diverse and range in market size based on television households from through in the nation 
all but one of our stations are affiliates of the wb television network 
our second station in the albuquerque santa fe marketplace is a upn affiliate 
our nine stations have only been on the air  or achieving measurable ratings  for years 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of advertising time to local  regional and national advertisers 
our revenues depend on popular programming that attracts audiences in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers  allowing us to sell advertising time at satisfactory rates 
like all commercial television stations  our rates are directly affected by the number of and demographic makeup of our viewing audience  as measured by nielsen media research 
our revenues also depend significantly on factors such as the national and local economy and the level of local competition 
approximately of our revenues are derived from programming that airs between the hours of pm to midnight  monday through sunday 
network prime time  which is a subset of this daypart  accounts for of our total revenues 
our average broadcast season mid september to mid september ratings amongst adults aged years old in this pm to midnight daypart  based on the average of the three major sweeps ratings periods november  february and may of each broadcast season have grown steadily over the past several years 
excluding madison  which we acquired in december  our weighted average rating in this demographic for the daypart was for the season  a rating for the season and a rating for the season 
our weighted average adult years old average ratings for this daypart for the november ratings period declined compared to november overall  ratings for our prime time programming declined approximately  but the second hour of our monday through friday prime time programming declines 
this lead in decline to our late fringe programming decline in the popularity and ratings of our late night relationship oriented programming caused our post prime programming to decline by approximately 
these ratings declines were offset somewhat by rating gains in our weekday programming from pm to pm pm for our eastern time zone stations 
since we have more commercial inventory available to sell in our pre prime shows than our network and our mostly barter late night programming we believe we will continue to grow our overall advertising revenues 
our stations are generally ranked either fifth or sixth in their markets in terms of either our share of viewers or our share of the market s broadcast television revenue 
in periods of lower advertising demand such as has been the case for much of the past three years competition from market leaders  generally the abc  cbs  nbc and fox affiliated stations  increases as these stations become more aggressive in price to maintain their revenue share 
over the past several years  biennial political spending in the even years has seen dramatic growth 
while we do not directly benefit from this political advertising since most campaigns target older viewers than we generally deliver  we indirectly benefit as the increased demand has the effect of increasing pricing for non political advertising as overall inventory available to these advertisers in each market declines 
the year is expected to include significant political advertising demand in what appears to be a very competitive presidential race and also has the usual number of state and local elections that will occur in the fall general elections 
like the television advertising business in general  our revenues are usually highest during the fourth quarter of each year  primarily due to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season consumer spending and an increase in viewership during this period 
we generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising and to national sales representatives on national advertising 
our revenues reflect deductions from gross revenues for commissions payable to advertising agencies and national sales representatives 
our primary ongoing operating expenses are costs of services  selling  general and administrative expenses  corporate expenses and depreciation and amortization and  in  an expense related to an impairment in our broadcast licenses 
costs of services include programming costs  which consist primarily of amortization of broadcast rights relating to syndicated programs as well as costs associated with our morning news show  the daily buzz which  as of january   is jointly produced by us and emmis effectively reducing our costs in half for this program and music rights fees 
other costs of service include advertising expenses targeted at viewers  which is net of any reimbursement received or due to us for such advertising and promotion from the wb network  upn or from other program suppliers  and engineering and transmission related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include salaries  sales commissions to account executives  ratings service expenses  insurance and various related overhead expenses 
corporate expenses reflect costs of corporate management  which includes senior management and other centralized management support staff  along with investor relations expenses  professional fees  directors and officers insurance and other related corporate overhead 
in the fall of  we began to experience a noticeable slowdown in non political advertiser demand 
by december  it was clear that there was a dramatic weakness in demand affecting all media related companies and there were broader indications that the us economy was in a slowdown 
this slack demand continued through all of  and the resultant effect of the events of september  only made a tough year worse 
by industry accounts  television revenues declined approximately over  the steepest decline in the last years 
nearly every publicly traded television broadcaster  including us  posted year over year declines in advertising revenues 
advertising demand began to rebound early in and by the end of the year  aided by robust political advertising demand in most markets  year over year gains in most of our markets averaged approximately 
in march  operation freedom commenced in iraq and advertising demand was adversely affected for several weeks 
while there have been several key indications  including strong growth in the nation s gross domestic product and a reversal of the unemployment rate  that the us economy is in a recovery mode  advertising demand in general has remained relatively weak 
heading into  with what very likely will be another strong  perhaps even record setting  political advertising year  the consensus outlook among industry executives and equity research analysts is for an improved operating environment as we move through the year 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  calendar marked an important year for us as we completed the sale of our st 
louis and portland stations which enabled us to substantially reduce our total debt  thereby significantly reducing future interest expense 
also  for the first time  our net revenue for our continuing stations exceeded our costs of services  exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  on a same station basis  excluding the results of our madison acquisition in same station basis  our revenues increased 
these revenue gains primarily reflect our ratings gains over the past year along with modest market revenue gains during based on third party market audits performed in seven of our eight markets excluding the green bay market  where no audit is performed  our weighted average non political revenue share grew to approximately in and the overall weighted average growth in non political advertising dollars in these same markets grew compared to programming expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s programming expenses of million 
on a same station basis  programming expenses increased 
programming costs have increased primarily due to better and more expensive syndicated programming eg that s show and king of queens added to our schedules over the past eighteen months and increased programming costs related to our three hour morning news show  the daily buzz  which was on the air for a full year in compared to four months in other costs of services increased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
on a same station basis  other costs of services increased  which was attributable to increased utilities and operating lease expenses relating to our new digital transmissions 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
on a same station basis  sg a expenses increased 
this increase in sg a relates primarily to added sales staff  increased customer incentive trip expense and higher nielsen ratings expenses 
we expect the growth in the combined costs of services and sg a expenses to moderate in as future program upgrades will be mostly offset by expiring licenses on earlier syndication product  our costs to produce the daily buzz have been essentially halved effective january  through our joint venture arrangement with emmis and we will have more favorable year to year comparisons in our sales and engineering costs as the growth in these areas slows 
corporate expenses for decreased to million from million in this decrease in corporate expenses was due primarily to reductions in salary  incentive compensation and related expenses  professional fees and directors and officers insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million compared to million for this increase of approximately  primarily reflects our investment in capital equipment in connection with our digital transmission facilities over the past eighteen months  which as of december   we have substantially completed 
equity based compensation was  in compared to  in this non cash expense  which relates to options granted below market value in to certain management in exchange for the termination of their participation in our previously established long term incentive plan  decreased in due to the termination of some of those participants and the winding up of the amortization periods 
interest expense for the current year was million compared to million for we redeemed all of our senior discount notes due the television notes on april  and our senior secured discount notes the intermediate notes on april  and september  with proceeds from the tribune transaction and borrowings under its senior credit facility 
in connection with these early extinguishments of debt  we incurred an expense of million 
based on our total debt at december   including our capital lease obligations  and the effective interest rates at that date  and excluding any new borrowings in  our projected annualized cash interest expense is approximately million 
we incurred a tax expense of million in compared to million in the tax expense in relates primarily to increases in deferred tax liabilities 
the tax expense in relates primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance required as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of our income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million  which included a pre tax gain on sale of assets of million 
pre tax income from operations of discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to pre tax income for the twelve months ended december  of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  in calendar year our station group achieved solid revenue gains as market conditions improved from a recession and affected  and strong political advertising once again indirectly benefited us by tightening inventory available at competing stations for non political advertisers 
the growth in our net revenues exceeded the growth in our costs of services  excluding depreciation and amortization  and allowed us to narrow our operating losses compared to calendar net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million compared to million for the year ended december  these revenue gains reflect primarily our ratings gains over the past year along with modest market revenue gains during programming expenses increased to million compared to the prior year s operating expenses of million 
this increase was attributable primarily to our continued investment in programming  including that s show and our september launch of a new three hour morning news show  the daily buzz 
other costs of services increased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased utilities and operating lease expenses relating to the roll out of digital transmissions at several of our stations during sg a expenses increased to million compared to a prior year expense of million 
this increase in sg a relates primarily to added sales staff  increase in nielsen ratings expenses as two of our markets were metered during the period and increased customer incentive trip expenses 
corporate expenses for increased to million from million in this increase in corporate expenses was due primarily to increased incentive compensation expense  professional fees and increased directors and officers insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million compared to million for this million decrease reflects the cessation of the amortization of intangible assets effective january  in connection with our implementation of sfas no 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
equity based compensation was  in compared to  in this non cash expense  which relates to options granted below market value in to certain management in exchange for the termination of their participation our previously established long term incentive plan  decreased in due to the termination of some of those participants 
interest expense for was million compared to million for this million increase in interest expense is the result of increasing principal balances arising from continued amortization of original issuance discounts on our television notes  which began accruing cash interest on october   and our intermediate notes due in  which began accruing cash interest on october  in addition  during we incurred higher interest charges on our senior credit facility  which was undrawn during  but which was drawn upon in to fund interest payments on the television notes and capital expenditures in excess of operating cash flow 
we incurred a tax expense of million in compared to a tax benefit of million in the tax expense in relates primarily to an increase in the valuation allowance required as a result of the implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of the difference in the statutory federal rate of and our effective tax benefit of relates to the impact of non deductible expenses 
our income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to million for calendar this increased income relates primarily to a reduction in amortization of intangibles as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 partially offset by an increase in our tax expense of discontinued operations 
our net loss for was million as compared with the million loss incurred in  an increase of million 
this increase in our net loss is primarily the result of the one time deferred tax expense recorded in resulting from the impact of sfas no 
and increased interest expense  partially offset by improved operating results and reduced amortization of intangible assets 
liquidity and capital resources prior to  we carried a high level of debt arising from the issuance of our television notes and intermediate notes in september these notes were issued at an original discount 
the television notes began accruing cash interest on october  and the first semi annual interest payment of million was made on march  the intermediate notes began accruing cash interest on october  and the initial semi annual interest payment of million was made on march  largely due to our desire to significantly reduce our debt levels  we sold our biggest stations to tribune in march and during redeemed substantially all of our long term debt 
total cash interest paid on these notes in was million 
due to their redemption during the year  cash interest on these notes in was reduced to million 
our total debt at december   including our capital lease obligations  was million 
our cash used in operating activities  before considering cash interest expense  has been declining as our stations continue to develop and improve their operating margins 
in  exclusive of cash interest expenses  cash used in operating activities was approximately million and we expect future capital expenditures  scheduled repayments of capital lease obligations and cash interest expense obligations  we will be a net borrower in and will likely be a net borrower in net cash used in operating activities was million for compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for  a decrease in use of cash of million 
the decreased use was primarily due to reduced cash interest expense of million  increased net revenue in excess of cash costs of service and reduced corporate expenses  net of an increase in taxes paid of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for compared to million for the million decrease in net cash used in investing activities relates primarily to a reduction in capital expenditures in due to the larger digital related expenditures in and the million acquisition in of our madison station 
net cash used by financing activities for was million as we repaid all of our long term notes from the proceeds of the tribune transaction and repaid million in capital lease obligations of our continuing stations in our net cash provided by financing activities in was million and primarily represented borrowings under our revolver in principally related to the financing of our madison acquisition and higher capital expenditures relating to our digital build out 
net cash provided by discontinued operations of million included the million purchase consideration for the sale of our stations to tribune plus cash provided from operations and working capital of the sold stations prior to the closing date  net of transaction costs and taxes paid 
the million in cash provided by discontinued operations in was from the full year operations of the stations sold 
in august  after our tribune transaction  we amended and restated our senior credit agreement with our lenders to extend the facility s maturity date to july   provide for slightly higher interest rates and amend our financial covenants  which include quarterly tests for minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  maximum leverage ratios  minimum tangible net worth and annual tests for maximum capital expenditures 
as of december   the balance under this revolving credit facility was approximately million and we are in compliance with the covenants of the credit agreement 
the amended facility also allowed us to increase the maximum borrowing amount from million to million by no later than march  if certain conditions were met 
we met these conditions and exercised our right to increase the facility to million on february  the increase in the facility became effective on february  at december   amounts due under all capital lease facilities totaled million bearing an implicit average interest rate of per annum 
we expect to incur approximately million in additional capital expenditures in  primarily related to our upgrade of our transmission facilities at wbuw in madison and  to a lesser extent  the conversion to high definition broadcast at half of our station group with the other half being converted in and routine capital expenditures at our other eight television stations 
we are currently in discussions to secure a capital lease line to finance our ongoing and future capital equipment expenditures 
at december   we had million of cash  million of which is restricted to collateralize capital lease obligations  and working capital of  before considering any possible future acquisition  including any of our four pending construction permits  during at least the next twelve months it will be necessary for us to continue to borrow under our senior credit facility as the cash generated from our station operations does not offset our cash corporate expenses  projected capital expenditures and cash interest costs 
we expect that any future acquisitions and related capital expenditures of television stations  including any of the three construction permits in richmond  lexington  ky and flint  would be financed through our revolver  a possible new capital lease line and  if necessary  through additional debt and equity financings 
although we believe it would be a secondary alternative  we also believe we have the ability to sell select stations in the event of unforeseen credit difficulties  such as might be experienced if there were further declines in the us economy or in advertising demand 
there is no guarantee that such other means of raising capital will be at terms acceptable to us  and accordingly current stockholders could be adversely affected by such financings 
certain factors that may effect future results and financial condition the following factors could have a material and adverse impact on our business the developmental nature of our continuing stations poses risks to stockholders  including the following we have not generated positive operating cash flow from our continuing operations and our future performance will depend upon our ability to continue increasing our ratings and revenues in a relatively healthy advertising environment  our ability to obtain financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions might be impeded  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and our ability to withstand competitive pressures is limited 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from advertisers in diverse industries 
if a number of our advertisers continue to reduce their expenditures because of the current or a future general economic downturn  or an economic downturn in one or more industries or regions  or for any other reason  our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not meet our interest obligation under our amended senior revolving credit facility  or if we otherwise default under this agreement  this debt may be accelerated 
in addition  because of our leverage  we may be less able to respond to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or borrow under an amended  restructured or new revolving credit agreement to meet our obligations and commitments  we will be required to raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations or delay or forego acquisitions 
these alternative strategies would likely not be effected on satisfactory terms  if effected at all 
if we fail to meet some or all of the covenants contained in this facility  we may not be able to borrow under the facility which might adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions as planned or meet general or extraordinary capital needs 
most of the programming we air and derived revenues from is either provided by our networks the wb in the case of eight of our stations and upn in the case of the ninth or from rerun syndication product 
if any of our network affiliation agreements are not renewed by the networks  or if the pricing for rerun syndication product increases  our ratings could decline or our costs increase which could adversely affect our financial performance 
in addition  as most rerun syndication programming is purchase well in advance of it becoming available for our stations to air  we are at risk of such acquired programming not achieving the expected ratings and the possibility that the revenues generated by such programs will not recoup the contractual programming cost 
we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and an adverse change in our performance or in economic conditions within our markets could lead to future impairments that could negatively affect our operating results 
we have incurred net losses from continuing operations in each of our fiscal years since inception and expect to continue to experience net losses during the coming year or two 
such losses might make it difficult to refinance or replace our senior credit facility when it expires in july our plans to acquire additional television stations during the past several years have been adversely affected by our increased leverage resulting from a decline in our broadcast cash flow and the related constraints in borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
although we will have significantly reduced our debt through the sale of our discontinued operations  we will still likely need to borrow under a senior credit facility to successfully execute and implement additional station acquisitions 
our inability to secure such financing could limit our future growth 
furthermore  our ability to acquire additional television stations is affected by the following many competing acquirors have greater resources available to make such acquisitions than we have  desired stations might not be available for purchase  we might be unable to obtain the wb network affiliation for all of the stations we acquire  we might not have the financial resources necessary to acquire additional stations  we might be unable to obtain fcc approval of the assignments or transfers of control of fcc licenses  and current fcc rules limit the number of television broadcasting properties that any one person or entity  including its affiliates  may own in any given market which could limit our ability to pursue desired stations 
generally when we sign acquisition agreements  we enter into interim local marketing agreements with the seller under which we receive some or all of station revenues and pay proportionate station expenses 
because the seller retains ultimate programming control  we bear the economic risks of paying station expenses until closing the acquisition 
mr 
kellner s consulting agreement provides that  while an officer of company  he may perform services for other businesses unaffiliated with ours that  in certain limited circumstances  may be competitive 
because of mr 
kellner s experience in the television broadcast industry  if mr 
kellner provides services to a competing business  it could materially affect our operations 
mr 
kellner will be retiring from the wb network in the summer of until such time  his position at the wb network could create conflicts with his position with us if our interests differ from those of the wb network 
because mr 
kellner is both our chief executive officer and the wb network s co chief executive officer  the wb network requires that he recuse himself from any material transaction between the wb network and us 
additionally  although mr 
kellner s consulting agreement requires him to devote his time  attention  knowledge and skills to fulfill his duties as our chairman and chief executive officer  it does not require a minimum time commitment 
all of our continuing television stations are relatively new in their markets and are still developing 
many of them have never generated positive cash flow from operations and the group  as a whole and including corporate expense  has never generated positive cash flow from operations 
our ability to service our debt and stay in compliance with our senior credit agreement is ultimately dependent on our generating positive cash flow from operations 
networks that air programming exclusively on cable and direct broadcast continue to increase their aggregate share of overall television viewers 
a continued decline in broadcast television viewership could result in reduced industry advertising revenues and adversely affect our business 
cable operators have become increasingly aggressive and successful in competing for local market advertising revenue as they have been able to upgrade sales capabilities and continue to offer more targeted viewer audiences 
this increased competition to local television broadcasters has  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our business 
emerging technologies that allow viewers to digitally record and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower our advertising revenues 
the pvr penetration rate has increased dramatically over recent years and the likelihood of direct broadcast and cable services including such devices for nominal fees in their next generation set top boxes will likely drive pvr penetration rates further 
advertisers and agencies are increasingly raising their concerns that this new technology is reducing the value of their commercial messages 
the fcc requires that all stations stop using analog signals on the stations by as of year end  television sets with digital receivers were present in less than of us television households  and accordingly  we are unable to predict the extent of consumer demand for digital television will be or when that demand will arise 
if we are required to cease analog operations before viewers have converted to digital television  our revenues and operating results will be adversely affected 
contractual cash obligations our contractual cash obligations  including the repayment of our revolving credit facility  by year of payment  are as follows senior credit facility program rights obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations year thereafter total includes audience measurement service agreements and various software license agreements 
in addition to the above contractual obligations  we expect that our capital expenditures for  which are primarily related to our upgrade of transmission including digital facilities for our madison station  conversion to high definition broadcast capability at approximately half of our station group and routine capital expenditures will be approximately million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to broadcast rights  bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
programming rights our programming rights are stated  on a gross basis  at the lower of amortized cost or estimated realizable value 
we evaluate estimated realizable value of programming rights based on current usage and revenue performance and projected future revenue and usage of such programs 
changes in our programming schedule could impact the estimated realizable value of programming 
in addition  estimates of future revenue performance relate to the number of advertising spots we sell and the amount generated from such sales 
a decrease in the number of spots sold or the amount for such sales could also impact our estimated realizable value 
during  and  we recorded write downs of program rights due to impairments of   and  respectively 
impairment of long lived asset values the carrying values of our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the impairment analysis is based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the stations 
based on these estimates  we have not recorded any impairment related to long lived assets for or future adverse changes in market conditions  changes in technology and other factors could reduce the expected future cash flows and result in an impairment charge

additionally  sfas amends sfas to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after may  with early adoption of the provisions related to the rescission of sfas encouraged 
upon adoption  companies must reclassify prior period items that do not meet the extraordinary item classification criteria in opinion no 
the adoption of sfas for long lived assets held for use did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas however we were in compliance with the disclosure requirements as of december  revenue recognition we record revenue from the sale of airtime related to advertising and contracted time at the time of broadcast 
revenue and expenses associated with barter agreements in which broadcast time is exchanged for programming rights are recorded at the estimated average rate of the airtime exchanged 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we utilize information available to us  including the timing of payments and the financial condition of our customers  to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we do not have a significant concentration of accounts receivable from any single customer or industry segment

sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead  tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
in june and adopted sfas no 
effective january  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations that were completed before july  were amortized until the adoption of sfas no 
we re evaluated our reporting units effective december  and determined that the appropriate level to test goodwill for impairment should be at the market level 
previously  we evaluated our goodwill on a consolidated basis 
based on our evaluations of goodwill including goodwill relating to discontinued operations at january   december  and december  our annual impairment testing date  there was no impairment of goodwill 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we determined that our identifiable intangible assets  which represent our broadcast license  have indefinite lives 
accordingly  we test these intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of statement and no longer amortize these intangibles effective january  at january  and december   we determined that the fair value of its intangible assets exceeded their carrying values and no impairment was recorded in as of december   we determined that one of our station s broadcast license had been impaired due to a decline in market conditions and we recorded a million impairment of that license 
as of the date of adoption  january   we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of million and unamortized identifiable intangible assets in the amount of million  all of which was subject to the transition provisions of statements and apart from the million impairment described above  no amortization expense related to goodwill and intangible assets was recorded for the years ended december  or impact of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

under sfas no 
 the asset retirement liability is to be adjusted each accounting period to reflect the passage of time and any changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statements ending after december  we do not have any guarantees that require disclosure under fin fin also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
fin requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of a guarantee  which is the obligation to stand ready to perform if specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions are effective for all guarantees within the scope of fin issued or modified after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fin and have applied the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after december  to date we have not entered into any guarantees
