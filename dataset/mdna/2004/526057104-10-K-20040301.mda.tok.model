results of operations overview we achieved record revenues  profits and earnings per share in our net earnings in were million  or per share diluted  compared to million  or per share diluted  in the increase in net earnings was attributable to strong homebuilding gross margins and increased operating earnings from our financial services division 
in particular  both our deliveries and average sales price on homes delivered increased due to strong demand resulting from supply constraints  strong demographic trends  low interest rates and improving economic trends 
with billion of cash at year end  our net homebuilding debt ie  homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash to total net capital ie  net homebuilding debt plus stockholders equity ratio was at november   compared to last year 
additionally  we had zero outstanding under our billion revolving credit facilities at year end 
our record earnings combined with a strong balance sheet contributed to a return on net capital of approximately in  compared to approximately in earnings per share amounts for all years have been adjusted to reflect the effect of our april class b common stock distribution and our january two for one stock split

backlog dollar value including unconsolidated partnerships at november   our market regions consisted of homebuilding divisions in the following states east florida  maryland  virginia  new jersey  north carolina and south carolina 
central texas  illinois and minnesota 
west california  colorado  arizona and nevada 
during  we expanded our operations in california and south carolina through homebuilding acquisitions 
during  we acquired nine homebuilders  which expanded our operations into the carolinas and the chicago  baltimore and central valley  california homebuilding markets and strengthened our positions in several of our existing markets 
the results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 
revenues from sales of homes increased in and in  compared to the previous years as a result of a increase and a increase in the number of home deliveries  respectively  in and  and a increase in the average sales price in both years 
in  new home deliveries were higher in most of our markets  primarily in california  florida  texas and illinois 
in  new home deliveries were higher primarily due to a strong homebuilding market  combined with our acquisitions during the year 
the average sales price of homes delivered increased in and primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in most of our existing markets  combined with changes in our product and geographic mix 
gross margin percentages on home sales were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in was due to a greater contribution from a strong california market  combined with lower interest costs due to a lower debt leverage ratio while we continued to grow 
the increase in was due to improved operational efficiencies and strength in the homebuilding markets in which we operated  partially offset by softness primarily in the texas market 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to in  compared to and in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to higher personnel related expenses  compared to the increase in was primarily due to an increase in insurance costs  compared to gross profits on land sales totaled million in the year ended november   compared to million in and million in profits in were positively impacted by each of our regions  with strong contributions from our east and west regions 
equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships was million in the year ended november   compared to million in and million in management fees and other income  net  totaled million in the year ended november   compared to million in and million in land sales  equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships  and management fees and other income  net  may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions by us and our unconsolidated partnerships 
at november   we owned approximately  homesites and had access to an additional  homesites through either option contracts or our unconsolidated partnerships 
at november   approximately of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts 
our backlog of sales contracts was  homes billion at november   compared to  homes billion at november  the higher backlog was primarily attributable to our homebuilding acquisitions and growth in the number of active communities  which resulted in higher new orders in  compared to as a result of these acquisitions combined with our organic growth  inventories increased during  while revenues from sales of homes increased for the year ended november   compared to prior year 
financial services our financial services division provides mortgage financing  title insurance  closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of our homes and others 
the division sells the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market 
the division also provides high speed internet access  cable television and alarm installation and monitoring services to residents of our communities and others 
the following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our financial services division 
the results of operations of companies we acquired during these years are included in the information since the respective dates of the acquisitions 
years ended november  dollars in thousands revenues costs and expenses operating earnings dollar value of mortgages originated number of mortgages originated mortgage capture rate of lennar homebuyers number of title closing transactions excluding title policies issued number of title policies issued operating earnings from our financial services division increased to million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to improved results from our mortgage and title operations  which benefited from low interest rates and a strong refinance and housing environment 
the increase in was primarily due to improved results from our mortgage and title operations  which benefited from a low interest rate and strong housing environment in the operating earnings in included a million gain on the sale of a cable system 
the division s mortgage capture rate ie  mortgage capture rate is the percentage of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services for the entire year decreased in the year ended november  due to the transitioning of the mortgage business related to the homebuilders we have acquired since the beginning of fiscal as well as increasing competitiveness in the mortgage market 
corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in compared to in and in financial condition and capital resources at november   we had cash of billion  compared to million at the end of fiscal the increase in cash was primarily due to an increase in net earnings partially offset by an increase in inventories as we position ourselves for future growth 
in connection with the acquisition of the newhall land and farming company by an entity jointly owned with lnr property corporation lnr  we contributed approximately million to fund a portion of the purchase price 
the majority of this commitment was funded subsequent to year end 
operating cash flow activity during and  cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to million and million  respectively 
during  cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings and a decrease in loans held for sale offset in part by an increase in operating assets to support a significantly higher backlog and a higher number of active communities 
in particular  inventories at november  had increased by million since november   due to an increase in backlog and the expansion of operations in our market areas 
we finance our land acquisition and development activities  construction activities  financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances  as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities 
during  cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings offset in part by increased levels of operating assets to support a significantly higher backlog and a higher number of active communities as we continued to grow 
cash flows provided by operating activities were lower in due to an increase in financial services loans held for sale of million and million in receivables 
we sell the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market  generally within days of the closing of the loans 
the cash related to these loans and receivables was primarily received in december and was used to pay down our warehouse lines of credit 
inventories increased million in as we positioned ourselves for future growth 
investing cash flow activity cash flows used in investing activities totaled million in the year ended november  compared to million in  and cash provided by investing activities of million in in  we used million of cash for acquisitions and million for net additions to operating properties and equipment 
this usage of cash was offset by million of net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest 
in  we used million of cash for acquisitions offset by million of net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships 
in  million was provided by the sale of substantially all of our mortgage servicing rights and million related to net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest 
this generation of cash was offset by million of net additions to operating properties and equipment 
during  we expanded our presence in california and south carolina  with our homebuilding acquisitions and we purchased a title company  which expanded our title and closing business into the chicago market 
in connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions  we paid million  net of cash acquired 
during  we expanded our operations into the carolinas and the chicago  baltimore and central valley  california homebuilding markets and strengthened our positions in several of our existing markets through our homebuilding acquisitions 
in connection with the acquisitions  total consideration  including debt of acquired companies  totaled approximately million 
the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 
we are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies 
we currently are engaged in discussions regarding possible transactions 
however  we have no agreements or understandings regarding any transactions  and it is possible we will not enter into any significant transactions in the near future 
in july  we formed a joint venture with lnr named nwhl investment  llc nwhl  and nwhl entered into an agreement to acquire the newhall land and farming company newhall 
newhall s primary business is developing two master planned communities in los angeles county  california 
the transaction was completed on january  the total purchase consideration  after payments with regard to employee options  was approximately billion 
in connection with the transaction  nwhl and another company jointly owned by us and lnr  obtained million of bank financing  of which million was used in connection with the acquisition of newhall 
the remainder of the bank financing will be available to finance operations of newhall and other property ownership and development companies that are jointly owned by us and lnr 
we and lnr each contributed approximately million to nwhl to fund a portion of the purchase price 
simultaneous with the closing of the transaction  lnr purchased income producing properties from newhall for approximately million and we agreed to purchase homesites and obtained options to purchase homesites from the venture 
financing cash flow activity the following summarizes our senior notes and other debts payable november  dollars in thousands zero coupon senior convertible debentures due zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due term loan b due us home senior notes due through the fortress group  inc senior notes due mortgage notes on land and other debt our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total net capital was at november   compared to at november  the decrease in the ratio primarily resulted from cash generated by our operations during in addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding and financial services activities  we will continue to actively evaluate various other uses of capital which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital requirements 
this may include acquisitions of or investments in other entities  the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt 
these activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities  cash generated from operations  sales of assets or the issuance of public debt  common stock or preferred stock 
our average debt outstanding was billion in both and and billion in the average rates for interest incurred were in  and in both and the majority of our short term financing needs are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our senior secured credit facilities 
in may  we amended and restated our senior secured credit facilities the credit facilities to provide us with up to billion of financing 
the credit facilities consist of a million revolving credit facility maturing in may  a million day revolving credit facility maturing in may and a million term loan b maturing in december we may elect to convert borrowings under the day revolving credit facility to a term loan  which would mature in may the credit facilities are collateralized by the stock of certain of our subsidiaries and are also guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities 
at november   million was outstanding under the term loan b and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facilities 
at november   we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of million 
the majority of these letters of credit are posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or are posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts 
of our total letters of credit  million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the credit facilities 
in february  we issued million of senior notes due at a price of 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities 
proceeds from the offering  after underwriting discount and expenses  were approximately million 
we used million of the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and added the remainder to our general working capital 
the senior notes were issued under our shelf registration statement 
at november   our financial services division had warehouse lines of credit totaling million  which included a million temporary increase that expired in december  to fund its mortgage loan activities 
borrowings under the facilities were million at november  and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold not yet funded with outstanding principal balances of million 
the warehouse lines of credit mature in may million and in october million  at which time we expect both facilities to be renewed 
additionally  the line of credit maturing in may includes an incremental million commitment available at each fiscal quarter end 
at november   we had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to million 
borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by mortgage loans 
we also had a million revolving line of credit with a bank  collateralized by certain assets of the division and stock of certain title subsidiaries 
borrowings under the line of credit were million at november  we have various interest rate swap agreements  which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on approximately million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations 
the interest rate swaps mature at various dates through and fix the libor index to which certain of our debt interest rates are tied at an average interest rate of at november  the net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates 
counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions 
at november   the fair value of the interest rate swaps  net of tax  was a million liability 
our financial services division  in the normal course of business  uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the division enters into forward commitments and  to a lesser extent  option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates 
we do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance 
changes in capital structure on april   at our annual meeting of stockholders  our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that eliminated the restrictions on transfer of our class b common stock and eliminated a difference between the dividends on the common stock renamed class a common stock and the class b common stock 
the only significant remaining difference between the class a common stock and the class b common stock is that the class a common stock entitles holders to one vote per share and the class b common stock entitles holders to ten votes per share 
because stockholders approved the change to the terms of the class b common stock  we distributed to the holders of record of our stock at the close of business on april   one share of class b common stock for each ten shares of class a common stock or class b common stock held at that time 
the distribution occurred on april  and our class b common stock became listed on the new york stock exchange nyse 
our class a common stock was already listed on the nyse 
approximately million shares of class b common stock adjusted for the january two for one stock split were issued as a result of the stock distribution 
additionally  our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue to million shares of class a common stock and million shares of class b common stock 
however  we have committed to institutional shareholder services that we will not issue  without a subsequent stockholder vote  shares that would increase the outstanding class a common stock to more than million shares or increase the outstanding class b common stock to more than million shares 
the principal purpose of the april class b stock distribution and the amendments to our certificate of incorporation was to make a greater number of authorized shares available for us to use in acquisitions  to sell in order to raise capital  to issue under stock option or other incentive programs or otherwise to issue 
in june  we called our zero coupon senior convertible debentures due the debentures for redemption 
at the option of the holders  the debentures could have been converted into class a common stock at any time prior to the redemption date 
each  principal amount at maturity of debentures was convertible into shares of class a common stock inclusive of the adjustment for the april class b stock distribution and january two for one stock split  which equated to a redemption price of approximately per share of class a common stock 
in  substantially all of the debentures were converted into approximately million shares of class a common stock adjusted for the january two for one stock split 
in december  our board of directors approved a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend of class a and class b common stock for stockholders of record on january  the additional shares were distributed on january  there was no net effect on total stockholders equity 
share and per share data except authorized shares  treasury shares and par value for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split 
our stock option and restricted stock plan the plan provides for the granting of class a and class b stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers  employees and directors 
the exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights are not less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant 
no options granted under the plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant 
thereafter  exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted 
each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not more than years after the date of the grant 
at november   the plan had no shares of restricted stock outstanding 
in june  our board of directors increased our previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to million shares of our outstanding class a common stock adjusted for our january two for one stock split 
during  we did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock in the open market under these authorizations 
in prior years under prior approvals  we had repurchased approximately million shares not adjusted for our january two for one stock split of our outstanding class a common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or per share 
in december  we granted approximately million stock options adjusted for our january two for one stock split to our employees under the plan and in january  repurchased a similar amount of shares of our outstanding class a common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  or per share adjusted for our january two for one stock split 
in september  our board of directors voted to increase the rate at which dividends are paid with regard to our class a and class b common stock to per share per year payable quarterly from per share per year both adjusted for our january two for one stock split 
additionally  our board of directors voted to retire our class a common stock held in treasury 
in recent years  we have sold convertible and non convertible debt into public markets  and at year end  we had effective securities act registration statements under which we could sell to the public up to million of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or other securities and could issue up to million of equity or debt securities in connection with acquisitions of companies  businesses or assets 
based on our current financial condition and credit relationships  we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments investments in unconsolidated partnerships we frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
through partnerships  we reduce and share our risk and also reduce the amount invested in land  while increasing access to potential future homesites 
the use of partnerships also  in some instances  enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access  or could not obtain access on as favorable terms  without the participation of a strategic partner 
our partners in these partnerships generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers or other real estate entities 
while we view the use of unconsolidated partnerships as beneficial to our homebuilding activities  we do not view them as essential to those activities 
most of the partnerships in which we invest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
at november   we had ownership interests in these unconsolidated partnerships that did not exceed 
in many instances  we are appointed as the day to day manager of the partnerships and receive fees for performing this function 
during  and  we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  from unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests 
we and or our partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated partnerships 
option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when we receive the options 
during  and  million  million and million  respectively  of the unconsolidated partnerships revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
at november   the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of billion and total liabilities of billion  which included million of notes and mortgages payable 
in some instances  we and or our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees on certain partnership debt 
at november   we had recourse guarantees of million and limited maintenance guarantees of million of the unconsolidated partnerships debts 
when we and or our partners provide guarantees  the partnership generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders 
the limited maintenance guarantees only apply if a partnership defaults on its loan arrangements and the carrying value of the collateral generally land and improvements is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance 
if we are required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the carrying value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance  the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated partnership and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated partnership distributes 
during  the unconsolidated partnerships in which we were a partner generated billion of revenues and incurred million of expenses  resulting in net earnings of million 
our share of those net earnings was million 
we do not include in our income our pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
instead  we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships 
this in effect defers recognition of our share of the partnership earnings until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer 
in november  we and lnr each contributed our interests in certain of our jointly owned unconsolidated partnerships that had significant assets to a new limited liability company named landsource communities development llc landsource  in exchange for interests in landsource 
in addition  in july  we and lnr formed  and obtained interests in  nwhl  which agreed to purchase  and in january completed the purchase  of the newhall land and farming company  for a total of approximately billion 
we and lnr each contributed approximately million to nwhl to fund a portion of the purchase price  and landsource and nwhl jointly obtained million of bank financing  of which million was used in connection with the acquisition of newhall the remainder of the acquisition price was paid with proceeds of a sale of income producing properties from newhall to lnr for million 
we are not obligated with regard to the borrowings by landsource and nwhl  except that we and lnr have made limited maintenance guarantees and have committed to complete any property development commitments in the event of default 
the combined assets and liabilities of landsource and nwhl at november  were million and million  respectively 
our combined investment in landsource and nwhl was million at november  contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations at november  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years over years dollars in thousands homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable financial services notes and other debts payable including limited purpose finance subsidiaries operating leases total contractual cash obligations we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase  development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business 
option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated partnerships until we are ready to build homes on them 
this reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings 
at november   we had access to acquire approximately  homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated partnerships 
at november   we had million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs on real estate related to certain of these homesites 
we are committed  under various letters of credit  to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business 
outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled million at november  additionally  we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of billion 
we do not believe that draws upon these bonds  if any  will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our financial services division s commitments regarding loans in process totaled approximately billion at november  to minimize credit risk  we use the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to our lending activities 
since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers  the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately million as of november  substantially all of these commitments were for periods of days or less 
our financial services division uses mandatory mortgage backed securities forward commitments mbs to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it makes an interest rate commitment to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by entering into mbs only with investment banks with primary dealer status and with permanent investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and current market value 
at november   we had open commitments amounting to million to sell mbs with varying settlement dates through january economic conditions during  the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply demand relationship as well as low interest rates 
as a result of this favorable environment  as well as our recent homebuilding acquisitions and growth in the number of our active communities  our new orders increased by in although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical  it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years 
this has led some people to assert that the prices of homes and the stocks of homebuilding companies are overvalued and will decline rapidly when the market for new homes begins to weaken 
a decline in prices of stocks of homebuilding companies would make it more expensive  and could make it more difficult  for us to raise funds through stock issuances 
market and financing risk we finance our land acquisition and development activities  construction activities  financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances  as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities 
we also buy land under option agreements  which enable us to acquire homesites when we are ready to build homes on them 
the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings is managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets  careful management of the land development process  and limitation of risk by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land  as well as obtaining access to land through option arrangements 
backlog backlog represents the number of homes subject to pending sales contracts 
homes are sold using sales contracts which are generally accompanied by sales deposits 
before entering into sales contracts  we generally prequalify our customers 
in some instances  purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home or fail to qualify for financing and under certain other circumstances 
we experienced an average cancellation rate of in  compared to and in and  respectively 
although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes  they have not had a material impact on sales  operations or liquidity  because we closely monitor our prospective buyers ability to obtain financing and use the information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes 
we do not recognize revenue on homes covered by pending sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners 
seasonality we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year  although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings 
because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months  we typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half 
as a result  our earnings from sales of homes are generally higher in the second half of the fiscal year 
interest rates and changing prices inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates  which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction 
rising interest rates  as well as increased materials and labor costs  may reduce gross margins 
in recent years  the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us 
in addition  deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs 
therefore  either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements our discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their impact on our financial statements is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 
homebuilding division revenue recognition sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners 
additionally  sales of other real estate including sales of land and operating properties are recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is assured 
we do not include in our income our pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
instead  we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships 
this in effect defers recognition of our share of the partnership earnings until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer 
we believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition 
inventories inventories are stated at cost  unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value 
inventory costs include land  land development and home construction costs  real estate taxes and interest related to development and construction 
land  land development  amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas 
we evaluate our inventory for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from an asset is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change because of the assumptions about future sales and cost of sales and the impact of recognizing impairments on the assets reported in our consolidated balance sheets as well as our net earnings could be material 
our assumptions about future home sales prices and volumes require significant judgment because the residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical  it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years 
while no impairment existed as of november   there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to impairment of inventory 
warranty costs although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trade  we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies 
additionally  in some instances  we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors 
warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home 
reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment 
at november   the reserve for warranty costs was million 
while we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
additionally  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
investments in unconsolidated partnerships we frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers or other real estate entities 
most of the partnerships through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting  because we are not the primary beneficiary for partnerships created after january   as defined under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  and we have a significant  but less than controlling  interest in the partnerships 
we record the investments in these partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated partnerships and our share of the partnerships earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
advances to these partnerships are included in the investment amount 
management uses its judgment when determining the primary beneficiary of  or a controlling interest in  a partnership 
factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or only significant influence  the accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy 
as of november   we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated partnerships where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest but rather share control with our partners 
at november   the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of billion and total liabilities of billion 
financial services division revenue recognition loan origination revenues  net of direct origination costs  are recognized when the related loans are sold 
gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and delivered to an investor 
premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the policy 
escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed  usually upon the close of escrow 
in all circumstances  we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition 
allowances for loss reserves we provide an allowance for loan losses when and if we determine that loans or portions of them are not likely to be collected 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider various factors such as past loan loss experience  regulatory examinations  present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management 
anticipated changes in economic conditions  which may influence the level of the allowance  are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects 
at november   the allowance for loan losses was million 
while we believe that the year end allowance was adequate  particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans on a non recourse basis within days after we originate them  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge offs 
at november   we also had an allowance for title and escrow losses of million related to certain assets 
these allowances require management s judgments and estimates 
for these reasons  we believe that the accounting estimates related to the allowances for loss reserves are critical accounting estimates 
homebuilding and financial services divisions goodwill valuation goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the process of determining goodwill requires judgment 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate 
during fiscal  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we performed a test for impairment of goodwill as of december   which resulted in no impairment being identified 
goodwill is no longer subject to amortization 
instead  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of september  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
at november   goodwill was million net of accumulated amortization of million 
while we believe that no impairment existed as of november   there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to impairment of goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the changes are enacted 
we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
at november   our net deferred tax asset was million 
based on our assessment  it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings
