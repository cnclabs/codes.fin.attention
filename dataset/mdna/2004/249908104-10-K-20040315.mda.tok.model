item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  we made substantial progress in the clinic  expanded our patent portfolio and strengthened our balance sheet 
because of our accomplishments in  we are well positioned for growth as a company with a multi product  late stage pipeline 
we believe our platform technologies can be further leveraged to create additional new  proprietary pharmaceuticals from approved drugs that can be more efficiently delivered to maximize therapeutic benefit 
highlights for the year include completion of pivotal phase iii trial for metformin gr  initiation of and completion of pivotal phase iii trial for ciprofloxacin gr  initiation of phase ii clinical trial for furosemide gr  acquisition of exclusive rights to gabapentin gr  equity financing raising gross proceeds of nearly million  and addition of two new board members with expertise in building pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical businesses 
in  we reported a net loss of million or per share  compared to a net loss of million or per share for the year ended december  the net loss in was partially offset by a one time payment of million to us from bristol myers squibb as a patent litigation settlement 
cash and investment balances at december  were million 
revenues for the year ended december  totaled million compared with million for the year ended december  revenues from collaborative agreements increased to million in from million in as a result of development services provided for two collaborative partners 
revenue from ddl ended with the termination of ddl s development activities as of august research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to expenses related to the hiring of additional research and development personnel to support our new drug applications with the fda to gain approval of metformin gr and ciprofloxacin gr 
shareholders equity as of december  was million and increased from a deficit of million for the year ended december  our net loss of million in was offset by total net proceeds of million received from our private placement in the second quarter of and our public offering in the fourth quarter of in addition  as a result of modifying our joint venture agreements with elan corporation  plc  our series a preferred stock was reclassified into permanent shareholders equity 
we have four products in clinical testing or being prepared for submission to the fda 
the current status of each is described below 
metformin gr in december  our first phase iii clinical trial of metformin gr was completed and in february we reported positive results for the trial 
the trial compared metformin gr with bristol myers squibb s immediate release metformin product marketed as glucophage 
in the trial  metformin gr showed clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in hemoglobin ac and other measures of glycemic control 
in november  we completed the dosing of patients for the second phase iii clinical trial of metformin gr and we expect to complete the data analysis for this trial in march we expect that biovail will submit the nda to the fda in the second quarter of however  the earliest that we expect to be able to obtain fda approval to market metformin gr is in the first half of  if at all 
in may  we entered into an agreement with biovail laboratories granting biovail an exclusive license in the united states and canada to manufacture and market metformin gr 
ciprofloxacin gr in june  we initiated a phase iii clinical trial with an internally developed once daily formulation of the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin  called ciprofloxacin gr  for urinary tract infections 
in november  we completed the dosing of patients for this trial 
we expect to complete the data analysis for the phase iii clinical trial of ciprofloxacin gr in march we have begun preparing the nda and we intend to submit the nda to the fda in the second quarter of if the trial is successful 
however  the earliest that we expect to be able to obtain fda approval to market ciprofloxacin gr is in the first half of  if at all 
we are seeking potential marketing or co marketing partners for ciprofloxacin gr 
gabapentin gr in september  we amended or terminated several of the contracts governing the operation of our joint venture arrangements with elan 
following these modifications  ddl  our consolidated subsidiary of which we own  granted depomed an exclusive license to gabapentin gr  a product candidate developed in the joint venture which utilizes depomed technology and which depomed had originally licensed to ddl under a royalty bearing license agreement 
gabapentin is marketed by pfizer inc for adjunctive therapy for epileptic seizures and postherpetic pain under the label neurontin 
ddl successfully completed a phase i clinical trial on gabapentin gr in the first quarter of we expect to initiate a phase ii clinical trial on gabapentin gr in fourth quarter of for an indication to be determined 
furosemide gr in december  we initiated a phase ii clinical trial with furosemide gr  which we expect to complete in the third quarter of furosemide is a widely prescribed diuretic marketed as an immediate release formulation  and is sold by aventis as lasix as well as by several other pharmaceutical companies as a generic 
other research and development activities in october  we signed an agreement with activbiotics  inc to conduct feasibility studies to develop a controlled release oral tablet to deliver activbiotics broad spectrum antibiotic  rifalazil  to the stomach and upper gastrointestinal tract 
the target indication is the eradication of h 
pylori  the causative agent of most cases of peptic ulcers 
under the agreement  activbiotics has funded our research and development expenses related to the preclinical feasibility studies with rifalazil and has an option to acquire an exclusive license to rifalazil in combination with the gr system 
in addition  we are developing other product candidates expected to benefit from incorporation into our drug delivery system 
for example  we are collaborating with avi biopharma  inc on a project for the delivery of large molecules  such as antisense compounds  from the gr system 
we have also completed preclinical studies of a combination product comprising our metformin gr once daily formulation of metformin with a once daily sulfonylurea for type ii diabetes 
under our agreement with biovail  biovail has an exclusive option to license this product from us 
we expect that a phase i clinical trial for this product will commence only if we enter into a development and licensing agreement with biovail or another third party 
manufacturing capabilities in may  we received a state of california drug manufacturing license for our pharmaceutical laboratories and manufacturing facilities 
the license allows us to manufacture clinical supplies of our product candidates for our phase i and phase ii clinical trials  as well as to provide quality control and quality assurance testing in our laboratories for our phase i through phase iii clinical supplies 
we intend to employ contract manufacturers for any commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
equity financings in april  we sold  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock with net proceeds of approximately  in october  we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of per share with net proceeds of approximately  in november  we sold an additional  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share with net proceeds of approximately  pursuant to the exercise of the over allotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the public offering 
relationship with elan in january  we formed ddl as a joint venture with elan to develop products using drug delivery technologies and expertise of both elan and depomed 
ddl is owned by us and by a subsidiary of elan 
on september   we amended or terminated several contracts governing the operation of ddl 
the modifications to the joint venture arrangements included among other modifications  the termination of elan s participation in the management and the board of directors of ddl  the termination of elan s license of certain of its technologies to the joint venture and the cancellation of elan s right to exchange the series a preferred shares we issued to elan in january for an additional equity interest in ddl 
as a result of the elimination of this exchange right  our series a preferred stock was reclassified as permanent shareholders equity 
we continue to own of ddl  with the remaining held by a subsidiary of elan 
following the termination of elan s participation in the management and the board of directors of ddl  ddl s five member board of directors was reconstituted to include three of our executive officers one of whom serves on our board of directors and two of ddl s attorneys 
we do not expect ddl to perform any further product development 
ddl may receive royalties from product sales if any drugs developed by ddl  such as gabapentin gr  are successfully commercialized 
critical accounting policies and estimates a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and the impact and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and use of estimates to be critical policies 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue related to collaborative research agreements with corporate partners is recognized as the expenses are incurred for each contract 
we are required to perform research activities as specified in each respective agreement on a best efforts basis  and we are reimbursed based on the costs associated with supplies  other outsourced activities and the hours worked by employees on each specific contract 
our business strategy includes performing additional development work for our partners  which we expect will include milestone payments and license fees 
we will recognize nonrefundable milestone payments pursuant to collaborative agreements upon the achievement of specified milestones where no further obligation to perform exists under that provision of the arrangement 
license fees will be recognized over the period of continuing involvement of a specific contract or  if no continuing involvement exists  such license fees will be recognized upon receipt 
accrued liabilities we record accrued liabilities for certain contract research activities  including clinical trials  preclinical studies and other external development activities 
some of those accrued liabilities are based on estimates because billings for these activities may not occur on a timely basis consistent with the performance of the services 
if possible  we obtain information regarding the unbilled services directly from the service provider 
however  we may be required to estimate these services based on information available to our product development staff 
if we underestimate the research activity associated with a study at a given point in time  it would result in understated research and development expense in the period presented and overstated research and development expense in subsequent periods 
change in accounting principle in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  which requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the vie s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the vie 
prior to the adoption of fin  vies were generally consolidated by companies owning a majority voting interest in the vie 
the consolidation requirements of fin applied immediately to vies created after january  however  the fasb deferred the effective date for vies created before february  to the quarter ended march  for calendar year companies 
adoption of the provisions of fin prior to the deferred effective date was permitted 
we adopted fin on july   and consolidated ddl  as of that date  as we determined that ddl was a vie  as defined by fin  and that we absorb a majority of its expected losses 
accordingly  we were required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of ddl on july   which did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
also  as we had been responsible for of ddl s losses under the terms of our agreements with elan  we had been recognizing of ddl s losses under the equity method of accounting prior to july  since the inception of ddl through june   we had recognized approximately million  or of ddl s expenses 
upon the adoption of fin  we calculated what the impact would have been on our operations had we consolidated of ddl s expenses and recorded an offsetting noncontrolling interest equal to of ddl s expenses the amounts funded by elan under the arrangement for the period from ddl s inception through june   or million  there was no cumulative catch up charge to record upon the adoption of fin our results of operations include of the operating results of ddl for the six months ended december  the noncontrolling interest for the quarter was not material  and it has been included as an offset to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
as ddl does not have any revenue  its accounts are reflected entirely in our consolidated operating expenses 
in addition  in september  we modified our agreements with elan that govern the terms of the joint venture and as a result of such modifications  we are now responsible for of the funding requirements of ddl 
accordingly  we no longer allocate any portion of ddl s results of operations to the noncontrolling interest 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues revenues for the years ended december   and were approximately   and  respectively 
in  revenues consisted of  earned from our collaboration with activbiotics and  from small collaborations with undisclosed partners 
activbiotics is currently reviewing its strategy related to rifalazil 
we do not know whether we will provide additional product development services to activbiotics in in  revenues consisted of  earned for development work performed for ddl and  earned from activbiotics and several small collaborations with undisclosed partners 
development work performed for ddl was funded by the joint venture partners at the partners pro rata ownership percentage through september  when the funding period terminated 
we have no plans to perform development work for ddl in the future 
in  revenues consisted of  earned for development work performed for ddl and  earned from a collaboration arrangement with an undisclosed partner 
research and development expense research and development expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of  in was due primarily to expense related to the hiring of additional personnel to support the fda filings for metformin gr and ciprofloxacin gr 
other increases were  in internal research and development as a result of our internal manufacturing and testing of clinical materials for our phase i and ii clinical trials 
rent expense also increased  due to the additional space we leased in may these increases were partially offset by decreased expense of  for external research and development expense  including manufacturing expense due to the completion in of manufacturing of clinical trial supplies or drugs for our metformin gr and ciprofloxacin gr phase iii trials 
the increase in was due to an increase in clinical trial expense of  due primarily to two phase iii trials with metformin gr 
increased expense related to the hiring of additional employees of  also contributed to the total increase in although we expect the data analysis for our phase iii clinical trials to be concluded in the march  we believe that our research and development expenses will remain relatively flat or increase during due to anticipated increased expenditures on clinical trials and research and development for our other product candidates 
our research and development expenses currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  outsourced clinical and other research activities  consultants  depreciation  facilities  utilities and an allocation of corporate and administrative costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses cannot be predicted at this time for our product candidates in research and in development as it is not possible to determine the nature  timing and extent of clinical trials and studies  the fda s requirements for a particular drug and the requirements and level of participation  if any  by potential partners 
as potential products proceed through the development process  each step is typically more extensive  and therefore more expensive  than the previous step 
success in development therefore results  generally  in increasing expenditures 
furthermore  our business strategy involves licensing certain of our drug candidates to collaborative partners 
depending upon when such collaborative arrangements are executed  the amount of costs incurred solely by us will be impacted 
our largest cumulative research and development expense over the last three years has been related to the clinical trials of metformin gr 
in  and  our most advanced project  metformin gr  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total research and development costs for that year 
in  ciprofloxacin gr accounted for of our research and development cost 
in and  metformin gr was the only project to exceed of our total research and development costs 
we expect expenses related to metformin gr will decrease in since we expect to complete all clinical trial and regulatory activities in the second quarter of since metformin gr has been licensed to biovail  we can be reasonably certain of our remaining development and regulatory responsibilities and the associated expenses 
therefore  we are able to estimate that  as of december  the costs to complete our activities related to metformin gr will not exceed million  including costs for internal project management and support 
since  we have incurred research and development expenses of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and none in  related to conducting research and development activities on behalf of our joint venture  ddl 
as of august  ddl has terminated all product development activities and ddl will not perform any future product development 
we will not incur any additional associated expenses and no additional associated revenues will be earned related to research services performed on behalf of ddl 
our research and development activities can be divided into preclinical stage programs  which include analytical testing  process development  pilot scale production and preclinical testing  and later stage programs  which include clinical testing  regulatory affairs and manufacturing clinical supplies 
the costs associated with these programs approximate the following preclinical programs later stage programs our research and development activities can be divided into those related to our internal projects and those related to collaboration arrangements 
the costs related to internal projects versus collaboration arrangements approximate the following internal projects collaborative arrangements funded by partners collaborative arrangements not funded by partners the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives and the related stages of development for each product in development 
the information in the column labeled estimated completion date of current phase contains forward looking statements regarding timing of completion of product development phases 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see additional factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to the products listed below  from time to time we may enter into feasibility studies with collaborative partners that  if successful  may be followed by definitive agreements to advance development of the product

we expect that the pharmaceutical products that we develop internally will take  on average  from four to eight years to research  develop and obtain fda approval in the united states 
we generally must conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings 
these studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product 
we then submit the results of these studies to the fda as part of an investigational new drug application or ind which  if successful  allows the opportunity for clinical study of the potential new medicine 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process in phase i  we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug s early safety profile and its blood concentration profile over time 
a phase i trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase ii  we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and further evidence of safety 
a phase ii trial for our average potential product may take to months to plan and complete 
in phase iii  we conduct large scale  multi center  comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda prior to commercialization of the product 
a phase iii trial for our average potential product may take to years to plan and complete 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the phase iii trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
we currently have two products that have completed phase iii 
the successful development of pharmaceutical products is highly uncertain 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing 
the fda may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the fda s assessment of the risk benefit ratio to patients 
various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and record keeping for each product 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulation  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was due to a decrease of  in legal expense resulting from the settlement of our lawsuit with bristol myers squibb in november the decrease in was partially offset by an increase of  related to increased salaries and the hiring of a vice president of business development in december  a newly created position at that time 
other increases in included  for increased insurance rates and  in listing fees related to our move to the nasdaq national market from the american stock exchange in december the increase in over was primarily due to an increase of  in legal expense related to our lawsuit against bristol myers squibb 
in  we expect general and administrative expense will increase moderately over levels 
equity in loss of joint venture pursuant to our adoption of fin on july   we have consolidated the accounts of ddl on july   and have consolidated ddl s operating results  net of noncontrolling interest  for the period from july  through september  as we are responsible for of the expenses incurred by ddl beginning september  as a result of the modifications to our contracts with elan governing the operation of ddl  we have recognized of ddl s operating results for the period from september  through december  for the period from july  to september  we consolidated approximately  of ddl expenses  net of noncontrolling interest  included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
for the period from september  to december   we consolidated general and administrative expense of approximately  related to ddl 
we expect to consolidate general and administrative expense of approximately  annually until ddl is dissolved 
ddl does not have any fixed assets  liabilities or employees and will not perform any further product development 
for the year ended december   ddl recognized general and administrative expense and net loss of  for the year ended december   ddl recognized a loss of  which included  in research and development expense and  in general and administrative expense 
for the year ended december   ddl recognized a loss of  which included  in research and development expense and  in general and administrative expense 
the decrease in research and development expense was due to decreased development work conducted in on behalf of ddl 
in august  all research and development work for ddl ceased 
in and thereafter  we expect ddl will recognize annual general and administrative expense of approximately  related to legal fees until ddl is dissolved 
for the period from inception january  to december   ddl recognized a net loss of approximately  the net loss from inception to december  includes a  payment by ddl to elan for the acquisition of in process research and development rights related to certain elan drug delivery technologies 
to date  ddl has not recognized any revenue 
prior to the adoption of fin on july   our equity in the loss of ddl was based on of ddl s losses since we own of the ddl voting common stock  less the amounts funded by elan 
for the period from inception to june   we recognized approximately of ddl s loss  or approximately  as equity in the loss of the joint venture in our statement of operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately  and  of ddl s net loss  respectively 
in  we recognized approximately  of ddl s net loss prior to the adoption of fin on july  elan made available to us a convertible loan facility to assist us in funding our portion of the joint venture s losses up to a principal maximum of  the funding term of the loan expired in september see contractual obligations below for additional information on this loan facility 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to interest expense of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  interest expense increased due to compounding of accrued interest on the elan convertible loan facility and also from million in final loan draws which increased the elan loan balance in in  the increase in interest expense was also primarily due to higher elan convertible loan balances and as well as higher equipment loan balances 
for the year ended december   interest and other income increased to  from  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the increase was due to our increased investment balances as a result of our april private placement and our public offering in the fourth quarter of which was partially offset by decreasing average interest rates earned in compared to and in  the decrease from was due to declining cash and investment balances and declining interest rates 
net interest income also includes immaterial gains realized on the sale of some of our marketable securities 
gain from bristol myers legal settlement in january  we filed a complaint against bristol myers squibb in the united states district court for the northern district of california for infringement of our us patent no 
 in november  we signed a definitive settlement agreement and release with bristol myers squibb related to the litigation 
under the terms of the agreement  bristol myers squibb made a one time payment of million to us 
we and bristol myers squibb released all claims in the lawsuit against each other and granted each other a limited non exclusive royalty free license 
the license that bristol myers squibb obtained from us extends to certain current and future compounds that bristol myers may develop internally 
series a preferred stock dividend in january  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock at a price of  per share to fund our share of the initial capitalization of ddl 
the series a preferred stock accrues a dividend of per annum  compounded semi annually and payable in shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock dividends are convertible at anytime after january into our common stock 
the original conversion price of the series a preferred stock was 
however  as a result of our march financing  the conversion price has been adjusted to per share 
as the dividends are only convertible into our common shares  the dividends represent adjustments to the conversion price that are accounted for under eitf issue no 
 accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratios 
since the commitment date fair market value of the maximum number of common shares that could be issued pursuant to conversion of the series a preferred stock is less than the proceeds of issuance of the series a preferred stock  the series a preferred stock does not contain a beneficial conversion feature subject to recognition pursuant to issue no 
stock based compensation expense in december  our board of directors authorized an increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our stock option plan the plan by  shares 
on may   at the annual meeting of shareholders  our shareholders approved the increase to the plan 
in december and march  we granted options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock out of the  share increase of common stock at exercise prices of and  respectively  which represented the fair market values of our common stock on the respective dates of grant 
however  as the options were not deemed authorized for grant until the shareholders approved the increase in the number of shares authorized under the plan  the applicable measurement date for accounting purposes was on the date such approval was obtained 
since the fair market value of the underlying common stock on may  was  which was greater than the exercise prices of the stock options granted  we were required to record the difference of approximately  as deferred stock based compensation expense to be recognized ratably over the vesting period of the related stock options 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in stock based compensation expense related to the stock options 
we expect to recognize approximately  in stock based compensation expense related to these stock options per quarter through the second quarter of in july  our board of directors approved an amendment to all stock options granted to non employee members of our board of directors 
in the case of the death of a non employee director  the amendment provides for the director s beneficiary to exercise the director s stock options at anytime over the remaining life of the stock option 
a non cash compensation expense related to the amended stock options will be recognized if and when a director s beneficiary benefits from this modified provision 
the maximum stock based compensation expense would be  if all non employee directors benefit from this provision with respect to outstanding options 
to date  no expense has been recognized related to these options 
net operating losses we have not generated any taxable income to date 
at december   the net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately  future utilization of carryforwards may be limited in any fiscal year pursuant to internal revenue code regulations 
the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
as a result of the annual limitation  anticipated and future losses or changes in ownership of the company  all or a portion of these carryforwards may expire before becoming available to reduce our federal income tax liabilities 
related party transactions consulting agreement in september  we entered into a consulting agreement with burrill co  whereby we were required to pay a monthly retainer of  and other fees related to partnering arrangements 
the principal of burrill co  g 
steven burrill  is a member of our board of directors 
for the years ended december   and  we paid a total of   and  respectively  in connection with this agreement 
we terminated the agreement as of november  elan corporation  plc in january  ddl was formed to develop a series of undisclosed proprietary products using drug delivery technologies and expertise of both companies 
ddl is owned by depomed and by elan see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  collaborative arrangements and contracts  elan corporation  plc 
avi biopharma  inc in june  we entered into a joint collaboration to investigate the feasibility of controlled oral delivery of avi s proprietary neugene antisense agents 
our chairman  president and chief executive officer  john w 
fara  is currently serving as a director of avi biopharma  inc no revenues have been received under this agreement 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  working capital of  and accumulated net losses of  we expect to continue to incur operating losses until at least we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least september however  we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
our cash needs may also vary materially from our current expectations because of numerous factors  including results of research and development  results of license negotiations  relationships with collaborative partners  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  technological advances  results of clinical testing  requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies  and acquisitions or investment in complimentary business  products or technologies 
we will need substantial funds of our own or from third parties to conduct research and development programs  conduct preclinical and clinical testing  and manufacture or have manufactured and market or have marketed potential products using the gr system 
our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
we have limited credit facilities and no other committed source of capital 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue our development programs 
we may not be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if the company raises additional capital by selling its equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available the company may have to delay  postpone or terminate clinical trials  curtail other operations significantly  and or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
the inability to raise capital would have a material adverse effect on the company 
operating activities cash used in operations in the year ended december  was approximately  compared to approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to the net loss and decreases in accounts payable due to decreased clinical trial activity by the end of in and  the change in cash used in operations was due primarily to our net loss partially offset by our share of the loss of the joint venture a non cash charge in operating activities and increases in accounts payable due to increased clinical trials activity

addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of account 
issue no 
provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of accounting 
issue no 
also addresses the impact on the measurement and or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company 
finally  issue no 
provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting arrangement 
the provisions of issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  our adoption of issue no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities or fin 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after march  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity or fas  establishes standards on the classification and measurement of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
fas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  the adoption of fas has not had an impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
additional factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company 
we believe the following risks  along with the risks described elsewhere in this form k  are the material risks we face at the present time 
if any of the risks or uncertainties described in this form k actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the risks and uncertainties described in this form k are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 
we are at an early stage of development and are expecting operating losses in the future 
to date  we have had no revenues from product sales and only minimal revenues from our collaborative research and development arrangements and feasibility studies 
for the years ended december   and  we had total revenues of million in  million in and million in for the years ended december   and  we incurred losses of million in  million in and million in as we continue our research and development efforts  we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next two years 
therefore  we expect our cumulative losses to increase 
we will receive future payments from biovail related to metformin gr only if metformin gr is approved by the fda 
in may  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with biovail to manufacture and market metformin gr  our most advanced product candidate  in the united states and canada 
we are responsible for completing the clinical development of metformin gr 
biovail will not reimburse us for any of our expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of metformin gr 
we will not receive any payments from biovail unless the fda approves metformin gr for marketing in the united states  which we do not expect to occur prior to the first half of  if at all 
only if we receive fda approval of metformin gr will biovail be required to make a million payment to us 
as of december   we expected that our total remaining development and regulatory costs for metformin gr would be approximately million 
if we do not continue funding development costs of metformin gr  biovail will have the right to assume development of metformin gr 
in that event  our future payments from biovail may be reduced 
we will need additional capital to support our operations  which may be unavailable or costly 
as of december   our capital resources consisted of approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will permit us to meet our capital and operational requirements through at least september we base this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including the following greater than expected clinical development costs associated with ciprofloxacin gr or with our exclusive license with biovail described above under we will receive future payments from biovail related to metformin gr only if metformin gr is approved by the fda  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs that could result in costly additional research and delay the eventual sale of our products  results of clinical testing and the regulatory requirements of the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies that may lead to cash outlays greater than currently expected  results of our product licensing activities  and acquisitions of or investment in complementary businesses  products or technologies 
further  our existing capital resources may not be sufficient to fund our operations until such time as we may be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our operations 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds through the sale of our equity securities or from development and licensing agreements to continue our development programs 
we may not be able to raise such additional capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional capital by selling our equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in significant dilution of our shareholders equity positions 
if adequate funds are not available  we may have to curtail operations significantly  or obtain funds through entering into collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and affect our stock price 
the following factors will affect our quarterly operating results and may result in a material adverse effect on our stock price variations in revenues obtained from collaborative agreements  including milestone payments  royalties  license fees and other contract revenues  our success or failure in entering into further collaborative relationships  decisions by collaborative partners to proceed or not to proceed with subsequent phases of the collaboration or program  the timing of any future product introductions by us or our collaborative partners  market acceptance of the gr system  regulatory actions  adoption of new technologies  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents  infringement allegations and litigation matters  the introduction of new products by our competitors  manufacturing costs and difficulties  results of clinical trials for our products  changes in government funding  and third party reimbursement policies 
our collaborative arrangements may give rise to disputes over ownership of our intellectual property and may adversely affect the commercial success of our products 
we currently have a collaboration agreement with biovail to develop metformin gr 
in addition  we have entered into other collaborative arrangements  some of which have been based on less definitive agreements  such as memoranda of understanding  material transfer agreements  options or feasibility agreements and we may not execute definitive agreements formalizing these arrangements 
collaborative relationships are generally complex and may give rise to disputes regarding the relative rights  obligations and revenues of the parties  including the ownership of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations  especially when the applicable provisions have not been fully negotiated 
such disputes can delay collaborative research  development or commercialization of potential products  or can lead to lengthy  expensive litigation or arbitration 
the terms of collaborative arrangements may also limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies developed pursuant to such collaborations 
moreover  collaborative arrangements often take considerably longer to conclude than the parties initially anticipate  which could cause us to agree to less favorable agreement terms that delay or defer recovery of our development costs and reduce the funding available to support key programs 
we may not be able to enter into future collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms  which would harm our ability to commercialize our products 
further  even if we do enter into collaboration arrangements  it is possible that our collaborative partners may not choose to develop and commercialize products using the gr system technologies 
other factors relating to collaborations that may adversely affect the commercial success of our products include any parallel development by a collaborative partner of competitive technologies or products  arrangements with collaborative partners that limit or preclude us from developing products or technologies  premature termination of a collaboration agreement  or failure by a collaborative partner to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercial sales of products using the gr system 
generally  our collaborative arrangements do not restrict our collaborative partners from competing with us or restrict their ability to market or sell competitive products 
our current and any future collaborative partners may pursue existing or other development stage products or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
our collaborative partners may also terminate their collaborative relationships with us or otherwise decide not to proceed with development and commercialization of our products 
it is difficult to develop a successful product 
if we do not develop a successful product we may not be able to raise additional funds 
the drug development process is costly  time consuming and subject to unpredictable delays and failures 
before we or others make commercial sales of products using the gr system  we  our current and any future collaborative partners will need to conduct clinical tests showing that these products are safe and effective  and obtain regulatory approval from the fda and foreign regulatory authorities 
we will have to curtail  redirect or eliminate our product development programs if we or our collaborative partners find that the gr system has unintended or undesirable side effects  or products that appear promising in preclinical studies do not demonstrate efficacy in larger scale clinical trials 
even if our products obtain regulatory approval  successful commercialization would require market acceptance  cost effective commercial scale production  and reimbursement under private or governmental health plans 
any material delay or failure in the development and commercialization of our potential products  particularly metformin gr or ciprofloxacin gr  would adversely impact our financial position and liquidity and would make it difficult for us to raise financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approval  we will be limited in our ability to commercialize our products  and our business will be harmed 
our lead product candidate  metformin gr  has completed two pivotal phase iii clinical trials 
we expect to complete the data analysis for the second phase iii trial in march and we expect biovail will submit the new drug application nda to the fda for metformin gr in the second quarter of the earliest that we expect to be able to obtain fda approval to market metformin gr is in the first half of  if at all 
in june  we completed a phase ii clinical trial with an internally developed once daily formulation of the antibiotic drug ciprofloxacin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection  called ciprofloxacin gr 
in november  we completed a phase iii clinical trial for this product 
we expect to complete the data analysis for this trial in the march and submit the nda to the fda in the second quarter of  if the clinical trial is successful 
the earliest that we expect to be able to obtain fda approval to market ciprofloxacin gr is in the first half of  if at all 
the regulatory process is expensive and time consuming 
even after investing significant time and expenditures on clinical trials  we may not obtain regulatory approval of our products 
data obtained from clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
significant clinical trial delays would impair our ability to commercialize our products and could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do 
in addition  changes in regulatory policy for product approval during the period of product development and regulatory agency review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections 
even if we receive regulatory approval  this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which we can market a product 
further  once regulatory approval is obtained  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review 
the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
manufacturers of approved products are also subject to ongoing regulation  including compliance with fda regulations governing current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulations can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal of the government to renew marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
the approval process outside the united states is uncertain and may limit our ability to develop  manufacture and sell our products internationally 
to market any of our products outside of the united states  we and our collaborative partners are subject to numerous and varying foreign regulatory requirements  implemented by foreign health authorities  governing the design and conduct of human clinical trials and marketing approval for drug products 
the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing  and the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval set forth above  and approval by the fda does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other country  nor does the approval by foreign health authorities ensure approval by the fda 
if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our products from third party payors  we will be unable to generate significant revenues 
in both domestic and foreign markets  sales of our product candidates will depend in part on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefit management companies  and other healthcare related organizations 
if reimbursement is not available for our product candidates  demand for these products may be limited 
further  any delay in receiving approval for reimbursement from third party payors would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products  including pharmaceuticals 
our product candidates may not be considered cost effective  and adequate third party reimbursement may be unavailable to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an acceptable return on our investment 
federal and state governments in the united states and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare 
existing regulations affecting pricing may also change before any of our product candidates are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we may develop in the future 
we depend on third parties for manufacturing of our products 
failure by these third parties would result in lost revenue 
although we have established internal manufacturing facilities to manufacture supplies for our phase i and phase ii clinical trials  we do not have  and we do not intend to establish in the foreseeable future  internal commercial scale manufacturing capabilities 
rather  we intend to use the facilities of third parties to manufacture products for phase iii clinical trials and commercialization 
our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of products using the gr system may adversely affect our ability to deliver such products on a timely or competitive basis 
although we have made arrangements for the third party manufacture of metformin gr  there may not be sufficient manufacturing capacity available to us when  if ever  we are ready to seek commercial sales of other products using the gr system 
the manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers may be found to violate the proprietary rights of others 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products on acceptable terms  or if we encounter delays and difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  the market introduction and commercial sales of our products will be delayed  and our revenue will suffer 
applicable cgmp requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities will apply to the manufacture of products using the gr system 
we will depend on the manufacturers of products using the gr system to comply with cgmp and applicable foreign standards 
any failure by a manufacturer of products using the gr system to maintain cgmp or comply with applicable foreign standards could delay or prevent their initial or continued commercial sale 
business interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in the san francisco bay area  which is known for seismic activity 
we have not established a formal disaster recovery plan  and our back up operations and our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur 
a significant business interruption could result in losses or damages incurred by us and require us to cease or curtail our operations 
our advisors may have conflicting obligations to other entities that could result in intellectual property disputes between us and those entities 
two groups the policy advisory board and development advisory board and various individuals advise us on business and scientific issues and future opportunities 
certain of these individuals work full time for academic or research institutions 
others act as consultants to other companies 
in addition  except for work performed specifically for us and at our direction  any inventions or processes discovered by such persons will be their own intellectual property or that of their institutions or other companies 
further  invention assignment agreements signed by such persons in connection with their relationships with us may be subject to the rights of their primary employers or other third parties with whom they have consulting relationships 
if we desire access to inventions that are not our property  we will have to obtain licenses to such inventions from these institutions or companies 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our operating results have not been sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities would not change by a significant amount 
foreign currency fluctuations we have not had any significant transactions in foreign currencies  nor did we have any significant balances that were due or payable in foreign currencies at december  therefore  a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have an impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we do not hedge any of our foreign currency exposure
