item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to our financial condition and results of operations of the company for each of the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading facilities based provider of integrated telecommunications and internet services to businesses and other high usage customers and telecommunications operators in combined access points in moscow  kiev  st 
petersburg  nizhny novgorod  krasnoyarsk and other major population centers throughout russia and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states cis 
we organize our operations into four business groups  as follows business and corporate services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks in and between major metropolitan areas of russia  ukraine and other countries of the cis  we provide business and corporate services including voice and data services to corporate clients across all geographical markets and all industry segments  other than telecommunications operators  carrier and operator services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks in and between major metropolitan areas of russia  ukraine and other countries of the cis  we provide a range of carrier and operator services including voice and data services to foreign and russian telecommunications and mobile operators  consumer internet services 
using our fiber optic and satellite based networks  we provide dial up internet access to the consumer market and web content offered through a family of internet portals throughout russia  ukraine and kazakhstan  and mobile services 
using our mobile networks in kiev and odessa  ukraine  we provide mobile services with value added features  such as voicemail  roaming and messaging services on a subscription and prepaid basis 
we intend to offer all of our integrated telecommunication services under the golden telecom brand  although  due to the recent acquisition of oao comincom comincom  some services still carry the combellga brand 
our dial up internet services are distributed under the rol brand in russia and kazakhstan and under the svit on line brand in ukraine 
additionally  we hold a minority interest in mct corp 
mct  which in turn has ownership interests in mobile operations located throughout russia and in uzbekistan and tajikistan 
we treat our ownership interest in mct as an equity method investment and are not actively involved in the day to day management of the operations 
in august  mct concluded a binding agreement with ojsc mobile telesystems on the sale of five of its cellular operators 
ojsc mobile telesystems acquired these five cellular operators from mct for million and assumed certain guarantees as part of the transaction 
most of our revenue is derived from high volume business customers and carriers 
our business customers include large multi national companies  local enterprises  financial institutions  hotels and government agencies 
we believe that the carriers  including mobile operators  which contribute a substantial portion of our revenues  in turn derive a portion of their business from high volume business customers 
thus  we believe that the majority of our ultimate end users are businesses that require access to highly reliable and advanced telecommunications facilities to sustain their operations 
we have traditionally competed for customers on the basis of network quality  customer service and range of services offered 
in the past several years  other telecommunications operators have also introduced high quality services to the segments of the business market in which we operate 
competition with these operators is intense  and frequently results in declining prices for some of our services  which adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  some of our competitors do not link their prices to the united states us dollar ruble exchange rate  so when the ruble devalues  their prices effectively become lower in relation to our prices 
the ruble exchange rate with the us dollar has become relatively stable since early  has appreciated during and price pressures associated with devaluation have eased considerably 
we cannot be certain that the exchange rate will remain stable in the future and therefore we may experience additional price pressures 
since early  we have witnessed a recovery in the russian market  but downward pricing pressures persists from increased competition and the global trend toward lower telecommunications tariffs 
in  and during  our traffic volume increases exceeded the reduction in tariffs on certain types of voice traffic 
this is a contributory factor to the increases in our revenue in  and during we expect that this trend of year over year increases in traffic volume will continue as long as the russian economy continues to develop at its current pace 
in order to handle additional traffic volumes  we have expanded and will continue to expand our fiber optic capacity along our heavy traffic and high cost routes to mitigate declines in traffic margins  reduce our unit transmission costs and ensure sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand for data and internet services 
we expect to and have continued to add additional transmission capacity  which due to its fixed cost nature can initially depress margins  but will over time allow us to improve or maintain our margins 
on january   a new law on telecommunications new law came into effect in russia 
the new law sets the legal basis for the telecommunications business in russia and defines the status that state bodies have in the telecommunications sector 
we cannot predict with any certainty how the new law will affect us 
the new law may increase the regulation of our operations and until such time as appropriate implementing regulations consistent with the new law are promulgated by the ministry of communications  there will be a period of confusion and ambiguity as regulators interpret the legislation 
in kiev  ukraine we have entered into agreements to obtain sufficient numbering capacity for our business services operations 
our ability to grow our business services operations in kiev may become limited if the parties who provide our numbering capacity and other infrastructure requirements are unable or unwilling to perform under their contracts with us 
we have entered into an interim arrangement with ukrtelecom on allocation of indirect numbering capacity to us  and expect the allocation to be completed in the beginning of  which will cause us to incur significant additional costs 
this would enable us to participate in sharing profits from fixed to mobile calls termination on a par with other ukrainian mobile operators 
however  introduction of cpp principle may eventually decrease average revenue per subscriber in our mobile network in ukraine 
in we signed new amendments to the settlement agreement with ukrtelecom allowing incoming international traffic termination to ukrainian public switched telephone network pstn via ukrtelecom s network 
also  we signed a new agreement with utel for incoming international traffic termination to ukrainian pstn s 
outgoing international traffic is routed through our international gateway to international operators using least cost routing 
a faction within the parliament introduced a bill which would have prevented telecommunications operators from charging for incoming calls of any kind 
although the sponsors of the bill were attempting to expedite the calling party pays cpp concept common in other countries  they overlooked the basic requirements needed to fully support the concept in ukraine  namely legislation governing inter operator settlements and billing functionality enhancements within the local infrastructure 
the bill was defeated in early after successful lobbying by the major players in the market  however  in february  the ukrainian parliament overrode the president s veto and adopted an amendment to the ukrainian communications law prohibiting all telecommunications operators from charging their end user customers for incoming calls  thus introducing the cpp principle  which entered into effect on september  state regulated tariffs for calls from the public switched telephone network to mobile networks were also introduced at this time  thus allowing mobile operators to receive a share of revenue from calls in to mobile networks 
to effect cpp settlements on our network we entered into an interim agreement with ukrtelecom that assigns a national destination code numbering plan to our mobile customers and reallocates our interconnect numbering capacity in kiev and odessa from our mobile to our fixed network 
this agreement became effective in november and enabled us to receive a settlement from revenue generated when a fixed line party calls our mobile customer 
this agreement also releases direct city numbering capacity for future sale to clec customers 
in addition to our traditional voice and data service provision  prior to  we were actively pursuing a strategy of developing non traditional telecom service offerings including those related to the internet  such as web hosting  web design  and vertical and horizontal internet portal development 
in line with experience outside of russia  we did not see the rapid development of internet based services that were expected 
internet based advertising and e commerce revenues did not develop to significant levels and we reviewed our long term strategy for internet based products 
as a result of this review  we evaluated the future cash flows for this business  and we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of we expect to see some growth in internet based advertising and will continue to offer this service to support our dial up internet service and be in a position to capitalize on any upturn in demand for this service 
we have seen a significant year over year increase in our dial up internet subscriber numbers and we expect the increase to continue  as our base of regional subscribers expands 
as additional dial up capacity becomes available in moscow  we expect to increase our market share in the capital as well 
in june  we completed the purchase of a leading russian internet service provider isp  cityline  together with uralrelcom  another isp and an infrastructure company  zao first telecommunications company ptk  and together  these entities allowed us to increase our regional dial up internet presence and increase our numbering capacity and access lines in moscow 
the new moscow capacity was initially placed into service in july the moscow numbering capacity and some of the access lines provided by ptk are allocated to support business and corporate services and carrier and operator services division end user customers  with the majority of the access lines being allocated to support planned increases in dial up internet subscribers in our consumer internet services division 
we have continued to integrate our acquisitions and improve operational efficiency while at the same time controlling costs 
we expect to incur further costs in connection with overall streamlining of our operations during as of april   all assets  liabilities  rights and obligations of teleross were transferred to sovintel as part of the legal merger of these two wholly owned subsidiaries 
recent acquisitions in august  we completed the acquisition of ownership interest in ooo sibchallenge sibchallenge  a telecommunications service provider in krasnoyarsk  russia for cash consideration of approximately million 
the acquisition of sibchallenge establishes our presence in the krasnoyarsk region 
in addition  sibchallenge has numbering capacity and interconnect agreements 
in december  we completed the acquisition of of the shares in comincom from nye telenor east invest telenor for a total purchase price of approximately million  consisting of approximately million in gti s common stock and direct transaction costs of approximately million 
the acquisition of comincom further strengthens our position in the key moscow and st 
petersburg communications markets  and positions us to realize future operating and capital expenditure synergies 
comincom provides telecommunications services  principally to major hotels  business offices and mobile communication companies through its telecommunications network in russia  including moscow  st 
petersburg  voronezh  samara and several other major population centers 
in february  we completed the acquisition of st holdings  a czech company that owns slightly over in zao samara telecom  a telecommunications service provider in samara  russia from smarts and individual owners for approximately million in cash 
critical accounting policies the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to assist that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies 
these policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
revenue recognition policies  we recognize operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers and installed 
under multiple delivery contracts involving a combination of product delivery  installation and maintenance  connection and service fees  revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the respective amounts 
elements are grouped if they are inseparable or objective evidence of fair value does not exist 
certain revenues  such as connection and installation fees  are deferred 
we also defer direct incremental costs related to connection fees  not exceeding the revenue deferred 
deferred revenues are subsequently recognized over the estimated average customer lives  which are periodically reassessed by us  and such reassessment may impact our future operating results 
in determining the recording of revenue  estimates and assumptions are required in assessing the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected 
allowance for doubtful accounts policies  the allowance estimation process requires management to make assumptions based on historical results  future expectations  the economic and competitive environment  changes in the creditworthiness of our customers  and other relevant factors 
changes in the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
in particular  we have certain amounts due to and from subsidiaries of a european telecommunications operator who is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
the ultimate resolution of this matter will be affected by a number of factors including the determination of legal obligations of each party  the course of the bankruptcy proceedings  and the enforceability of any determinations 
we have recognized provisions based on our preliminary estimate of net exposure on the resolution of these receivables and payables 
if our assessment proves to be incorrect we may have to recognize an additional provision of up to million  net of tax  although management believes that the possibility of such an adverse outcome is remote 
long lived asset recovery policies  this policy is in relation to long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment and intangibles  which comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
changes in technology or changes in our intended use of these assets may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
we perform periodic internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of current property and equipment 
additionally  long lived assets  including intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
estimates and assumptions used in both setting useful lives and testing for recoverability of our long lived assets require the exercise of management s judgment and estimation based on certain assumptions concerning the expected life of any asset and expected future cash flows from the use of an asset 
goodwill and assessment of impairment  commencing from the adoption of statement on financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we perform goodwill impairment testing annually as of october or whenever impairment indicators exist 
this test requires a significant degree of judgment about the future events and it includes determination of the reporting units  allocation of goodwill to the reporting units and comparison of the fair value with the carrying amount of each reporting unit 
based on the discounted cash flow valuations performed in  we concluded that for all reporting units the fair value is in excess of the respective carrying amounts 
valuation allowance for deferred tax asset  we record valuation allowances related to tax effects of deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that the respective tax assets will not be realized 
changes in our assessment of probability of realization of deferred tax assets may impact our effective income tax rate 
business segment information  we changed our reporting for business segments in the second quarter of prior to the completion of the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in sovintel and the subsequent merger of teleross into sovintel in april  we managed our business segments based on telecommunications products that we provided 
in the first quarter of  we re designed our business segments around customer characteristics 
currently  we report four segments within the telecommunications industry business and corporate services  carrier and operator services  consumer internet services and mobile services 
a significant portion of our cost structure  including our investment in infrastructure  benefits multiple segments 
as a result  we perform allocations of certain costs in order to report business segment information for management and financial reporting purposes 
applying different allocation techniques and parameters could impact the reported results of individual business segments 
functional currency  effective january   russia is no longer considered a hyperinflationary economy  therefore the determination of functional currency for united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap reporting purposes should be based on the analysis of the underlying business transactions for each russian subsidiary 
we have determined in accordance with the functional currency criteria of sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  the us dollar should be considered the functional currency of all russian subsidiaries 
there are subjective elements in this determination  including a weight given to each specific criteria established by sfas no 
changes in the underlying business transactions could lead to different functional currency determination for a particular subsidiary  which would have an impact on its reported financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgment 
we believe the following items represent such particularly sensitive accounting estimates allowance for doubtful accounts  any changes in the underlying assumptions of recoverability of accounts receivable by respective aging group or certain specific accounts that are excluded from the specific and general allowances could have a material effect on our current and future results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover estimated losses in our accounts receivable balances under current conditions 
tax provisions  in the course of preparing financial statements in accordance with us gaap  we record potential tax loss provisions under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in general sfas no 
requires loss contingencies to be recorded when they are both probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we record other deferred tax provisions under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required to determine when such provisions should be recorded  and when facts and circumstances change  when such provisions should be released 
useful lives of property and equipment and certain intangible assets  our network assets and amortizable intangible assets are depreciated and amortized over periods generally ranging from five to ten years 
any reduction or increase in the estimated useful lives for a particular category of fixed assets or intangible assets could have a material effect on our future results of operations 
business combinations  sfas no 
 business combinations  requires us to recognize the share in the assets of businesses acquired and respective liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
our estimates of the fair value of the identified intangible assets of businesses acquired is based on our expectations of future results of operations of such businesses 
in particular  our valuation of comincom s identified intangible assets might change as the appropriate regulations consistent with the new russian law on telecommunications  that came into effect on january   are promulgated and its effects on the future results of operations of comincom become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement provides the accounting for the cost of legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets

to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb no 
 
sfas no 
disclosure provisions are effective for years ending after december  we have adopted the amendments to sfas no 
disclosure provisions required under sfas no 
but will continue to use the intrinsic value method under apb no

as such  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact of the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the effect of applying sfas no 
on the reported net income loss  as disclosed below is not representative of the effects on net income loss in future years due to the vesting period of the stock options and the fair value of additional stock options in future years

results of operations gti is a leading facilities based provider of integrated telecommunications and internet services to businesses and other high usage customers and telecommunications operators in moscow  kiev  st 
petersburg  nizhny novgorod  krasnoyarsk and other major population centers throughout russia and other countries of the commonwealth of independent states 
the results of our four business groups from the operations of our consolidated entities combined with the non consolidated entities where we are actively involved in the day to day management  are shown in footnote segment information line of business data to our consolidated financial statements 
our functional currency is the us dollar  as the majority of our cash flows are indexed to  or denominated in us dollars 
through december   russia has been considered to be a highly inflationary environment 
from january   russia ceased to be considered as a highly inflationary economy 
as we currently believe our functional currency is the us dollar  this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
according to russian government estimates  inflation in russia was in  in  and in the russian government expects inflation to be approximately in although the rate of inflation has been declining  any return to heavy and sustained inflation could lead to market instability  new financial crises  reduction in consumer buying power and erosion of consumer confidence 
we have continued to integrate our acquisitions and improve operational efficiency while at the same time controlling costs 
we expect to incur further costs in connection with overall streamlining of our operations in in the first quarter of  we expect to incur a reorganization charge in the range of approximately million to approximately million for headcount reductions in association with the operational integration of comincom 
as of april   all assets  liabilities  rights and obligations of teleross were transferred to sovintel as part of the legal merger of these two wholly owned subsidiaries 
this resulted in the reorganization of our operations along the lines of customer characteristics as opposed to the types of telecommunications products we provide 
therefore  in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we have aligned our operating segments in the manner that the chief operating decision maker manages the operations for purposes of making operating decisions and allocating resources 
the discussion of our results of operations is organized as follows consolidated results

carrier and operator services 
revenue from carrier and operator services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase is due to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in sovintel  which was completed in the third quarter of we began consolidating sovintel into our results of operations from september  in addition  we have added a number of new carriers with increased volumes of traffic  especially voice over ip  and increased the number of services that we offer to cellular providers  which has more than offset general tariff declines  although pricing pressures still exist

consumer internet services 
revenue from consumer internet services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is largely the result of increases in the number of dial up internet subscribers from  at december  to  at december  and the average revenue per internet subscriber increasing from approximately per month to approximately per month over the same period 
mobile services 
revenue from mobile services increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  active subscribers increased from  at december  to  at december  and the average revenue per active subscriber has increased by to approximately per month due to an increasing number of subscribers on a tariff plan which allows for unlimited local calls for a fixed payment of per month 
as a result of the adoption of the cpp principle by the ukrainian parliament on september   we were unable to charge our mobile customers for incoming calls and our revenues were reduced accordingly 
expenses the following table shows our principal expenses for the years ended december  and december  consolidated expenses consolidated expenses for the year ended for the year ended december  december  in millions cost of revenue business and corporate services carrier and operator services consumer internet services mobile services eliminations total cost of revenue selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization equity in earnings of ventures interest income interest expense foreign currency loss provision for income taxes cost of revenue our cost of revenue increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  business and corporate services 
cost of revenue from business and corporate services increased by to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenue and the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue are mainly due to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in sovintel which was completed in the third quarter of we began consolidating sovintel into our results of operations from september  in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we had approximately million in customer premises equipment sales with significantly lower margins as part of a strategy to provide a wider range of communication and internet technology product to our existing customers

the acquisition of ownership interest in comincom was completed in the fourth quarter of we began consolidating comincom into our results of operations from december  as a result of consolidating comincom  cost of revenue from carrier and operator services increased by million for the year ended december  consumer internet services 
cost of revenue from consumer internet services increased by to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenue was mainly due to additional low cost interconnect capacity becoming available in the third quarter of mobile services 
cost of revenue from mobile services decreased by to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased due to the increased number of subscribers using the unlimited local call tariff plan which does not lead to additional settlement costs with other operators 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly due to increases in employee related costs  advertising  inventory obsolescence  bad debt expense  consulting costs associated with the operational integration of comincom  and other selling  general and administrative expenses arising from the consolidation of sovintel from september  and the consolidation of comincom from december  into our results of operations 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expenses increased by to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due in part to depreciation on continuing capital expenditures of the consolidated entities  but primarily relates to our acquisition of the remaining of sovintel and subsequent consolidation of sovintel as of september  into our results of operations 
in addition  depreciation and amortization increased by million due to the consolidation of comincom into our results of operations from december  equity in earnings of ventures the earnings after interest and tax charges from our investments in non consolidated ventures increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we recognized earnings at sovintel of million for the period from january  to september   which more than offset our recognized losses in mct of million 
the increase in equity in earnings was mainly due to receiving a million dividend from mct in the fourth quarter of  an equity investment in which we have ceased recognition of losses as they exceeded our investment base  partly offset by the effects of the acquisition of the remaining of sovintel and its subsequent consolidation as of september  into our results of operations 
interest income our interest income was million for the year ended december  down from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income mainly reflects lower interest rates earned on deposits in short term us money market funds

which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized effective from january  and which reduced our amortization expense by approximately million for the year ended december  and also as a result of the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of  which in turn reduced the level of depreciation and amortization recorded for the year ended december  by million 
these reductions were  in part  offset by depreciation on continuing capital expenditures of the consolidated entities

debt  excluding capital lease obligations  at december  was million  of this million was added in december  compared to million at december  foreign currency loss our foreign currency loss was million for the year ended december   compared to a million loss for the year ended december  the increase in foreign currency loss is due to a combination of movements in exchange rates and changes in the amount of net monetary assets that we have denominated in foreign currencies

other significant changes in balance sheet items  excluding the effect of consolidating sovintel are discussed below

income taxes our effective rate of income tax differs from the us statutory rate due to the impact of the following factors different income tax rates and regulations apply in the countries where we operate  amortization of goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets is not deductible for income tax purposes  and in the year ended december  we recorded a million impairment charge that was not deductible for income tax purposes 
prior to we have not recognized a tax benefit in relation to the deferred tax assets of our russian and ukrainian entities due to uncertainty over the application and future development of the tax regimes in the two countries 
however  in and  as a result of our russian and ukrainian subsidiaries profitability for russian and ukrainian statutory purposes and reasonable certainty of future profits  we recorded deferred tax assets in the appropriate russian and ukrainian subsidiaries 
in  we recorded the full amount of deferred tax asset for us loss carry forwards for income tax purposes 
in respect of the impairment charge  this created additional deferred tax assets  against which we recorded valuation allowances as a result of the uncertainties concerning 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents was million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
our total restricted cash was million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the restricted cash is maintained in connection with certain of our debt obligations as described below 
during the twelve months ended december   we had net cash inflows of million from our operating activities 
during the twelve months ended december   we had net cash inflows of million from our operating activities 
this increase in net cash inflows from operating activities at december  is mainly due to the increase of net income as a result of  increased revenues  and the consolidation of sovintel into our results of operations and financial position from september  and the consolidation of comincom into our results of operations and financial position from december   offset by increased payments for trade payables and slower collections from customers 
during the twelve months ended december   we received approximately million in cash from our customers for services and we paid approximately million to suppliers and employees 
during the twelve months ended december   we received approximately million in cash from our customers for services and we paid approximately to suppliers and employees 
we used cash of million and million for investing activities for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  which were principally attributable to building our telecommunications networks and acquisitions 
network investing activities totaled million for the twelve months ended december  and included capital expenditures principally attributable to building out our telecommunications network

for the year ended december   we recovered funds from escrow of million in association with our acquisition of ptk in june for the year ended december   we received net proceeds from investments available for sale of million and for the year ended december   we received net proceeds from investments available for sale of million 
in october  mct declared a cash dividend of per common share to holders of record as of october  our portion of this cash dividend was approximately million and was received in november for the year ended december   we received million net proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and for the year ended december   we received million net proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
we had working capital of million as of december  and million as of december  at december   we had total debt  excluding capital lease obligations  of approximately million  of which million were current maturities 
at december   we had total debt  excluding capital lease obligations  of approximately million  of which million were current maturities 
total debt included amounts that were fully collateralized by restricted cash 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a lease for the right to use fiber optic capacity  including facilities and maintenance  from moscow to stockholm 
the lease has an initial term of ten years with an option to renew for an additional five years 
the lease required full prepayments as the capacity increased from an stm to an stm to full capacity of stm full prepayments were made to the lessor in april  august and february these prepayments have been offset against the lease obligation in the financial statements of the company 
we will continue to make payments for maintenance for the term of the lease 
in september  we entered into a five year lease for the right to use up to vc fiber optic capacity on major routes within russia to support the increase in our interregional traffic and regional expansion strategy 
in december  we issued a million loan to the company that provided the capital lease 
the loan has payment terms of months  starting in january  and carries interest at the rate of percent per annum 
in february  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per common share to shareholders of record as of march  the total amount payable to shareholders is approximately million 
we believe that we have reached a level of operating profitability that allows for expansion and maintenance capital expenditures to be financed entirely from operational cash flows  and therefore we expect that a dividend will continue to be paid in the future 
some of our operating companies have received debt financing through direct loans from affiliated companies 
in addition  certain operating companies have borrowed funds under a back to back  seven year credit facility for up to million from a russian subsidiary of citibank 
under this facility  we provide full cash collateral  held in london  and recorded on our balance sheet as restricted cash  for onshore loans made by the bank to our russian registered joint ventures 
in a second  similar facility  we provide full cash collateral for a short term back to back  revolving  credit facility for up to million from the same bank for two of our larger russian operating companies 
the funding level as of december  for all these facilities totaled million  of which million was funded to our consolidated subsidiaries and million was funded to our non consolidated entities 
in order for us to compete successfully  we may require substantial capital to continue to develop our networks and meet the funding requirements of our operations and ventures  including possible losses from operations 
we may also require capital for our acquisition and business development initiatives 
the net proceeds from our ipo and our private placement have been applied to these funding requirements 
we also expect to fund these requirements through our cash flow from operations  proceeds from additional equity and debt offerings that we may conduct  and debt financing facilities 
in september  rol holdings limited rolh  a wholly owned cypriot subsidiary  entered into a secured million credit facility with zao citibank 
rolh drew upon the citibank credit facility in the fourth quarter of and loaned the funds to teleross to enable teleross to retire million of the million non interest bearing promissory note issued to rostelecom in connection with the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in sovintel previously held by rostelecom 
in june  we settled early the million of outstanding debt plus accrued interest 
there was no penalty for early settlement of this debt however an additional million of previously capitalized financing costs was recognized as interest expense which was previously being recognized over the life of the facility 
in the future  we may execute especially large or numerous acquisitions  which may require us to raise additional funds through a dilutive equity issuance  through additional borrowings with collateralization and through the divestment of non core assets  or combinations of the above 
in the case especially large or numerous acquisitions do not materialize  we expect our current sources of funding to finance our capital requirements 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our current estimates because of changes or fluctuations in our anticipated acquisitions  investments  revenue  operating costs and network expansion plans and access to alternative sources of financing on favorable terms 
further  in order for us to compete successfully  we may require substantial capital to continue to develop our networks and meet the funding requirements of our operations and ventures  including losses from operations 
we will also require capital for other acquisition and business development initiatives 
we expect to fund these requirements through our cash on hand  cash flow from operations  proceeds from additional equity and debt offerings that we may conduct  and debt financing facilities 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms 
as a result  we may be subject to additional or more restrictive financial covenants  our interest obligations may increase significantly and our shareholders may be adversely diluted 
our failure to generate sufficient funds in the future  whether from operations or by raising additional debt or equity capital  may require us to delay or abandon some or all of our anticipated expenditures  to sell assets  or both  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
as part of our drive to increase our network capacity  reduce costs and improve the quality of our service  we have leased additional fiber optic and satellite based network capacity  the terms of these leases are generally five years or more and can involve significant advance payments 
as demand for our telecommunication services increases we expect to enter into additional capacity agreements and may make significant financial commitments  in addition to our existing commitments 
as of december   we had the following contractual obligations  including short and long term debt arrangements commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and purchase obligations payments due by period in thousands less than total year years years short and long term debt  capital lease obligations    non cancelable lease obligations    purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our treasury function has managed our funding  liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
our investment treasury operations are conducted within guidelines that have been established and authorized by our audit committee 
in accordance with our policy  we do not enter into any treasury management transactions of a speculative nature 
the ruble and the hryvna are generally non convertible outside russia and ukraine  respectively  so our ability to hedge against further devaluation by converting to other currencies is significantly limited 
further  our ability to convert rubles and hryvna into other currencies in russia and ukraine  respectively  is subject to rules that restrict the purposes for which conversion and the payment of foreign currencies are allowed 
given that much of our operating costs are indexed to or denominated in us dollars  including employee compensation expense  capital expenditure and interest expense  we have taken specific steps to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in the appropriate foreign currency 
although local currency control regulations require us to collect virtually all of our revenue in local currency  certain ventures generally either price or invoice in us dollars or index their invoices and collections to the applicable dollar exchange rate 
customer contracts may include clauses allowing additional invoicing if the applicable exchange rate changes significantly between the invoice date and the date of payment  favorable terms for early or pre payments and heavy penalty clauses for overdue payments 
maintaining the dollar value of our revenue subjects us to additional tax on exchange gains 
although we are attempting to match revenue  costs  borrowing and repayments in terms of their respective currencies  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our cash and cash equivalents are held largely in interest bearing accounts  in us dollars  however we do have bank accounts denominated in russian rubles and ukrainian hryvna 
the book value as of such accounts at december  and approximates their fair value 
cash in excess of our immediate operating needs is invested in us money market instruments 
in accordance with our investment policy  we maintain a diversified portfolio of low risk  fully liquid securities 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our obligations and we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have developed risk management policies that establish guidelines for managing foreign currency exchange rate risk and we also periodically evaluate the materiality of foreign currency exchange exposures and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure
