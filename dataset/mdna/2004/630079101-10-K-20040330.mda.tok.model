item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the case of rohm and haas electronic materials rhem  formerly known as rodel  the company has collaborated in selling current generation ceria based chemical mechanical planarization cmp materials to rhem s customers 
rhem and nanophase have entered into a supply agreement which requires rhem to purchase of its annual requirements for  and specified minimum dollar amounts of  nanocrystalline ceria for use in cmp of semiconductors in order for rhem to retain its exclusive worldwide rights to the company s nanocrystalline ceria products in this field of use 
in february of  the company amended its original agreement with rhem 
this amendment allows for rhem to maintain its exclusivity based upon it purchasing lower dollar amounts  while extending the agreement through this amendment does not require rhem to purchase any materials from the company in  but it does require an aggregate of  in development funding be paid to nanophase in four equal quarterly installments in to support nanophase s efforts in joint slurry product development with rhem for current and future semiconductor technologies 

table of contents unless prior written notice is given  the agreement automatically renews for successive five year terms upon expiration of the initial term 
the agreement can also be terminated in its entirety in the case of a change in control of either company or some form of material breach 
currently  the company is working with rhem on next generation ceria based nanomaterials as well as on other nanomaterials geared toward attacking expanded cmp markets beyond those being reached with current nanomaterials 
the company leverages its resources through relationships with organizations focused on market specific eg  basf or geography specific areas 
these relationships enhance nanophase s ability to quickly develop lead customers and applications for its products 
for example  to promote a more rapid penetration into japanese markets  the company maintains its relationship with c 
i 
kasei  a division of itochu corporation cik 
cik develops  engineers and manufactures products under license from the company specifically for the company s pvs technology for use in multiple industrial markets 
the company s agreement with cik stipulates a minimum annual royalty of the greater of  or of cik s sales of licensed product  payable to the company until  to guarantee cik an exclusive license in designated parts of asia 
after that time  the agreement calls for a royalty of of cik s sales of licensed product  at which time cik s license of nanophase s pvs technology in designated parts of asia would become non exclusive 
cik may terminate its agreement with the company at any time upon days prior written notice 
management does not believe that revenue related to the cik agreement will contribute significantly  beyond the levels it has in the past  to the near term growth of the company 
on march   the company received  in gross proceeds in the form of an equity investment from altana chemie  ag altana  a large german chemical company 
altana received  shares of nanophase common stock 
altana and nanophase have agreed that the shares will remain unregistered  and therefore not freely saleable  until march  simultaneous to this transaction  the company executed a joint development agreement see exhibit with altana in order to explore new product applications in fields that are mutually beneficial to both companies 
pursuant to the agreement  the company and altana have granted each other  subject to limited exceptions  exclusive rights for the development and purchase of nanomaterials for use in paints  coatings  inks  polymers and plastics  varnishes  and similar applications 
management believes that this agreement will be beneficial to the company in several ways 
altana is a prominent ingredient supplier to many industries that the company has had limited success in approaching in the past including paint and industrial coatings companies 
by approaching these companies at the ingredient supplier level  with the company s materials already compounded into altana s ingredient products  the company expects a higher likelihood of success in various applications and in these industries 
secondly  altana has global sales  technical support  additional application development capability to incorporate nanomaterials  and an existing customer base and market relationships 
nanophase expects that this new partnership will help nanophase to address markets at an entry point that should allow for quicker and broader adoption of nanomaterials in composite coatings and plastics 
this mutually exclusive agreement is separate and distinct from the company s existing agreements with basf and rhem  as the fields of application do not intersect 
management expects altana to become a significant customer of nanophase in the agreement with altana has an initial term of eight years  with one year renewal provisions 
a limited number of key customers account for a substantial portion of the company s commercial revenue 
in particular  revenue from basf  rhem  and cik constituted approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
the company s customers are significantly larger than the company and are able to exert a high degree of influence over the company 
while the company s agreements with its three largest customers are long term agreements  
table of contents they may be terminated by the customer with reasonable notice and do not provide any guarantees that these customers will continue to buy the company s products 
the loss of one of these key customers or the failure to attract new customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company  from time to time  employs marketing representatives or sales agents focused in specific application areas 
nanophase also markets itself and its capabilities by sponsoring  attending and presenting at advanced materials symposia and industry trade shows for its target markets  and by publishing articles in a variety of scientific and trade journals 
the company also markets itself and its capabilities through its web site  by advertising in selected industry and trade journals  and by providing specification sheets and other marketing materials to prospective customers 
in addition  nanophase networks with certain fortune companies to display its technology and uncover potential applications 
the company often makes technical presentations at various events where the company s scientists and business development people meet with their counterparts at other companies and explore potential technical relationships and collaborative applications research 
technology and engineering the company s technology and engineering group includes the research and development  process engineering  and advanced engineering functions 
consistent with the company s goal to remain at the forefront of nanomaterials technologies  the objective of nanophase s research and process development activities is to gather core technologies that have the capability to serve multiple markets commercially  continue to improve and evolve the company s manufacturing technologies  and develop new nanomaterials and associated applications  usually working directly with potential and current customers 
nanophase s total research and development expense  which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups  during the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to keep pace with evolving advanced materials technologies and industry standards 
through the five year period ended december   the company has had cumulative research and development expenses of approximately million and cumulative expenditures on equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million 
these investments in technology and production capacity and capability have helped to take nanophase from a development stage company to commercialization 
manufacturing operations the company s manufacturing operations include the production of nanomaterials in the form of nanoparticles  utilizing two different methods pvs and nanoarc synthesis 
the company also has a large quantity nanoparticle coating operation to support its sunscreen business  as well as dispersion equipment to support its cmp and polishing initiatives and other product and market areas 
the company has manufacturing capacity based in two locations in the chicago area 
at each of these facilities  nanophase is able to develop and supply its nanomaterials in quantities ranging from grams to metric tons 
nanophase s facilities are certified to iso international standards and are substantially current good manufacturing practices cgmp compliant for applicable bulk pharmaceutical manufacturing 
all processes are controlled under six sigma discipline with the capability to manufacture precisely to application requirements 
unlike traditional quality control  six sigma provides methods to reengineer processes to eliminate non value added steps and create a system that minimizes errors and defects 
nanophase s operations employ a cellular team based manufacturing approach  where workers operate in work cells  under a lean manufacturing environment to continuously advance production capabilities 

table of contents management is committed to a lean manufacturing approach where  to the extent possible given a certain measure of irregular demand  the company is able to avoid excess labor  inventory  and supply levels in order to minimize working capital demands 
this approach complements our production management in the sense that two of the company s major production goals are to increase nanomaterials output without adding to existing equipment and the continuous reduction of production costs 
intellectual property and proprietary rights nanophase relies primarily on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property law  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect its intellectual property 
in addition to obtaining patent and trademarks based on the company s inventions and products  nanophase also licenses certain third party patents to expand its technology base 
during  nanophase continued to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio by adding to its patents  pending patents  and proprietary knowledge 
as of the date of this report  nanophase owns or licenses us patents and patent applications consisting of owned us patents  pending us patent applications and licensed us patents 
the owned us patents consist of for its nanoparticle synthesis technologies  for its surface treatment technologies  and for its nanoparticle applications in coating 
the company s pending us patents consist of in nanoparticle synthesis  in nanoparticle surface treatments involving dispersion of nanoparticles in various media  and in nanoparticle applications 
correspondingly  the company has foreign patents and pending patent applications consisting of owned foreign patents and pending foreign patents 
all of the pending and owned foreign patents are counterparts to domestic filings covering its platform of nanotechnologies 
in addition  the company s management believes that  based on its past experience  up to of its currently pending patent applications will be issued in the company s oldest patents will begin to expire in see the risk factors section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of risks related to our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
competition within each of its targeted markets and product applications  nanophase faces current and potential competition from many advanced materials and chemical companies  suppliers of traditional materials and the in house capabilities of several of its current and potential customers 
in many markets  the company s competitors are larger and more diversified than the company  although management believes its materials and related technologies are superior to those of its competitors in terms of their ability to be readily engineered to meet specific performance requirements 
with respect to traditional suppliers  however  the company competes against lower priced traditional materials where the benefits of using nanomaterials does not always outweigh their typically higher costs 
with respect to larger producers of nanomaterials  while many of these producers do not currently offer competitive products  these companies have greater financial and technical resources  larger research and development staffs  and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities and could soon begin to compete directly against nanophase 
in addition  the number of development stage companies involved in nanocrystalline materials continues to grow on a global basis  posing significant and increasing competitive risks 
many of these companies are associated with university or national laboratories  and use chemical and physical methods to produce nanocrystalline materials 
management believes that most of these companies are engaged primarily in funded research  and is not aware that any of them have commercial production capabilities  however  they may represent competitive risks in the future 
some development stage companies  especially in other countries  receive significant local government assistance 

table of contents governmental regulations the manufacture and use of certain of the products that contain the company s nanocrystalline materials are subject to governmental regulations 
as a result  the company is required to adhere to the current good manufacturing practices cgmp requirements of the us food and drug administration fda and similar regulations in other countries that include testing  control and documentation requirements enforced by periodic inspections 
in addition  the company s facilities and all of its operations are subject to the plant and laboratory safety requirements of various occupational safety and health laws 
to date  those regulations have not materially restricted or impeded operations 
employees on december   the company had a total of full time employees  of whom hold advanced degrees 
nanophase has no collective bargaining arrangements 
on february   the company announced that dr 
donald j 
freed  its vice president of business development  was retiring effective february  on march   the company hired dr 
edward g 
ludwig as its vice president of business development 
on december   the company announced that dr 
gina kritchevsky  its chief technology officer  had decided to pursue other interests and was returning to arizona 
the company retained dr 
kritchevsky s services through december as a consultant 
backlog nanophase does not believe that a backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 
the company s sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for delivery of nanomaterials 
nanophase has some agreements that give customers the right to purchase a specific quantity of nanomaterials during a specified time period 
these agreements  however  often do not obligate the customers either to purchase any particular quantity of such nanomaterials at all  or in the case where an obligation exists  the risk to the customer for not purchasing nanomaterials is the loss of exclusivity 
the quantity actually purchased by the customer  as well as the shipment schedules  are frequently revised during the agreement term to reflect changes in the customer s needs 
the company does not believe that such agreements are meaningful for determining backlog amounts

see the forward looking statements section in part i  item overview nanophase technologies is a nanocrystalline materials developer and commercial manufacturer with an integrated family of nanomaterial technologies 
nanophase produces engineered nanomaterials for use in a variety of diverse markets personal care  sunscreens  abrasion resistant applications  environmental catalysts  antimicrobial products  and a variety of polishing applications  including semiconductors  hard disk drives  and optics 
newer developed technologies have opened the capability for certain new products and new markets 
with the commercialization of the company s new nanoarc synthesis and new dispersion technologies in  and the expansion of these capabilities in  nanophase is focusing on penetrating the chemical mechanical planarization cmp and fine polishing markets 
cmp is the process of polishing various types of integrated circuits or chips to be used in various commercial electronics applications 
management believes that the company s inroads in the cmp and fine polishing markets would have been very difficult without the company being able to produce its materials to exacting specifications verified by in house and customer based testing 
management expects growth in end user customers of nanophase s customers adoption in and revenue growth in both of these areas beginning in the company targets markets in which it feels practical solutions may be found using nanoengineered products 
the company works closely with leaders in these target markets to identify their material and performance requirements 
from its inception in november through december   the company was in the development stage 
during that period  the company primarily focused on the development of its manufacturing processes in order to transition from laboratory scale to commercial scale production 
as a result  the company developed an operating capacity to produce significant quantities of its nanocrystalline materials for commercial sale 
the company was also engaged in the development of commercial applications and formulations and the recruiting of marketing  technical and administrative personnel 
since january   the company has been engaged in commercial production and sales of its nanocrystalline materials  and the company no longer considers itself in the development stage 
from inception through december   the company was primarily capitalized through the private offering of approximately million of equity securities prior to its initial public offering  its initial public offering of million of common stock in november of  its private offering of million of common stock in may of and its private offering of million of common stock in september of  each net of issuance costs 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of million from inception through december critical accounting policies nanophase utilizes certain accounting measurements under applicable generally accepted accounting principles that involve the exercise of management s judgment about subjective factors and estimates about the effect of matters which are inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following is a summary of those accounting measurements that involve business judgments which we believe are most critical to our reported results of operations and financial condition 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
product revenue consists of sales of product that are recognized when realized and earned 
this occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
other revenue consists of revenue from research and development arrangements with non governmental entities  fees from the transfer of technology  and the sale of production equipment that is designed and built by the company 
such sale of equipment occurred most recently in the first quarter of these types of equipment sales occur on occasion and are also treated as other revenue 
this transaction is discussed in further detail below 
research and development arrangements include both cost plus and fixed fee agreements and such revenue is recognized when specific milestones are met under the arrangements 
fees related to the transfer of technology are recognized when the transfer of technology to the acquiring party is completed and the company has no further significant obligation 
royalties are recognized when earned pursuant to the contractual arrangement 
inventory valuation 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost  maintained on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the company has recorded allowances to reduce inventory relating to excess quantities of certain materials 
write downs of inventories establish a new cost basis  which is not increased for future increases in market value of inventories or changes in estimated excess quantities 
if expected demand were either to unexpectedly accelerate or diminish for materials currently in inventory  this could cause management s estimates to become inaccurate resulting in potential increases in inventory allowances in the case of diminished demand  reducing gross margins or potential enhancements to gross margins caused by demand for items previously thought to have reduced near term marketability 
trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables  typically based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
impaired or disposal of long lived assets 
reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable or that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated 
the company assesses the recoverability of its assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
if assets are determined to be recoverable  but the useful lives are shorter than originally estimated  the net book value of the assets is depreciable over the newly determined remaining useful lives 
asset retirement obligations 
the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation which was recognized in the period it was incurred 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as a component of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
table of contents results of operations years ended december  and total revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in total revenue between and was mainly attributed to the sale of production equipment to an existing customer as discussed below 
product revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in product revenue was primarily attributed to approximately million in decreased sales from three sources  the company s largest customer in the sunscreen and personal care markets and two other existing customers in the abrasion resistant flooring and automotive catalyst markets 
the company and its largest customer currently have a technology agreement in place to jointly develop the second generation of sunscreen nanomaterials and for other potential personal care applications 
management expects increased demand for existing sunscreen and personal care materials  as well as the launching of several new applications  in when compared to levels 
the decrease in sales from these three sources was somewhat offset by approximately  in increased revenue from rhem  a customer since  in the cmp market 
in february of  the company amended its original agreement with rhem 
this amendment allows for rhem to maintain exclusivity based upon it purchasing lower dollar amounts of nanocrystalline materials  while extending the agreement through this amendment does not require rhem to purchase any materials from the company in  but it does require an aggregate of  in development funding be paid to nanophase in four equal quarterly installments in to support nanophase s efforts in joint slurry product development with rhem for current and future semiconductor technologies 
both companies remain optimistic over market adoption of the initial product in or in an additional smaller volume fine polishing application  the company was selected as the recommended nanoparticle dispersion polishing supplier by a leading manufacturer of optical polishing equipment 
management believes that this vote of confidence  while not relating to substantial direct revenue  will help to establish nanophase as a supplier of quality materials in the fine polishing market in general 
other revenue increased to  in  compared to  in this increase was largely due to revenue in the amount of  from the sale of a pvs reactor to cik in these types of equipment sales occur on occasion not on a regular annual basis and are treated as other revenue 
the majority of the revenue generated during was from customers in the healthcare sunscreens and cmp markets 
revenue from basf  rhem  and cik  the company s three largest customers  constituted approximately   and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 
cost of revenue generally includes costs associated with commercial production and customer development arrangements 
cost of revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in cost of revenue was generally attributed to increased depreciation expense resulting from the completion of the company s build out of its manufacturing and powder coating facilities and increased facility costs 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased from in to in due primarily to the effects of the completion of the company s build out of its manufacturing and powder coating facilities 
nanophase continued to reduce variable manufacturing costs on nanomaterials in with reductions ranging from to  depending upon the specific material 
in  nanophase also successfully completed iso certification the current standard at the time for its facilities in romeoville  and burr ridge  illinois 
the extent to which the company s margins remain positive  as a percentage of total revenue  will be dependent upon revenue mix  revenue volume  and the company s ability to continue to cut costs 
as product revenue volume increases  this will result in more of the company s fixed manufacturing costs being absorbed  leading to increased margins 
the company expects to continue reducing its product manufacturing costs in but may not operate at a positive gross margin for 
table of contents research and development expense  which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups  primarily consists of costs associated with the company s development or acquisition of new product applications and coating formulations and the cost of enhancing the company s manufacturing processes 
for example  the company is currently engaged in research to enhance its ability to disperse its material in a variety of organic and inorganic media for use as coatings and polishing materials 
recently  the company has demonstrated the capability to produce pilot quantities of mixed metal oxides in a single crystal phase 
these materials include cerium zirconium oxide  cerium lanthanum zirconium oxide  cerium praeseodymium zirconium oxide  and cerium samarium oxide 
we do not expect development of further variations on these materials to present material technological challenges 
many of these materials exhibit performance characteristics that can enable them to serve in various catalytic applications 
this development has been driven largely by customer demand 
management is now working on several related commercial applications 
the company expects that this technique should not be difficult to scale to large quantity commercial volumes once application viability and firm demand are established 
the company also has an ongoing advanced engineering effort that is primarily focused on the development of new nanomaterials as well as the refinement of existing nanomaterials 
the company has recently expanded its palette of materials to include nanoscale copper oxide and bismuth oxide for potential use in a variety of applications 
the company is not certain when or if any significant revenue will be generated from the production of the materials described above 
research and development expense increased to  in  compared to  in the increases in research and development expense was largely attributed to increased salaries due to no capitalization of labor in compared to approximately  in  product development costs  depreciation  and travel expenses 
in  the capitalization of payroll occurred with several employees in the advanced engineering group relating to the build out of its facilities 
these increases were partially offset by decreased spending in repairs and maintenance expense 
the company does not expect research and development expense to increase significantly in selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in  compared to  in the net increase was primarily attributed to business insurance  amortization expense relating to sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations adopted in  consulting fees for various professional services not related to accounting fees  travel  accounting  and legal expenses  both relating to the company s then current securities litigation and more general legal issues 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in director compensation due to recognition of this expense in a lump sum  when it was paid in january and additionally  as a monthly accrual throughout this treatment effectively resulted in twice as much total director compensation expense being recognized in  the year of the change in recording convention  than in interest income decreased to  in  compared to  in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in funds available for investment and  to a lesser extent  reduced investment yields 
years ended december  and total revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in total revenue between and was mainly attributed to growth with existing customers  particularly  an increase of approximately in total product derived from the company s largest customer 
product revenue increased to  in  compared to  in other revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the majority of the revenue generated during was from customers in the healthcare sunscreen  wear resistant materials  chemical mechanical planarization cmp and catalyst markets 
revenue from basf and cik  the company s two largest customers constituted approximately and  respectively  of the company s total revenue 

table of contents cost of revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in cost of revenue was generally attributed to increased product sales volume and increased depreciation expense resulting from the completion  and placement in service at the beginning of the current year and throughout the current year of the majority of the company s build out of its manufacturing and powder coating facilities  partially offset by efficiencies in the manufacture of the company s products 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in  compared to in improvements to gross profit are primarily due to increased revenues  continued gains in operating efficiencies  and nonrecurring other revenue in the amount of  received in the second quarter 
for the year  the company recognized a contribution of approximately  due to inventory being sold for which an allowance for excess inventory quantities had previously been recorded 
the company s june announcement regarding its new cmp partner  rhem  came about as a direct result of nanophase s successful research and subsequent application development 
the company also has an ongoing advanced engineering effort that is primarily focused on the development of new nanomaterials as well as the refinement of existing nanomaterials 
research and development expense decreased to  in  compared to  in the decreases in research and development expense was largely attributed to decreased outside testing  materials and supplies  and travel expenses being incurred in these reductions were somewhat offset by increased depreciation on assets completed and placed in service during  increased advanced engineering salaries due to lower capitalization of payroll approximately  in than in approximately  and increased spending on electricity and equipment expenses 
the capitalization of payroll for and is the result of the company s build out of its facilities 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in  compared to  in the net increase was primarily attributed to increases in salary expenses incurred relating to the hiring of a company executive  legal costs  real estate taxes  and bad debt expense which was zero at december   compared to a credit balance at december  these increases were partially offset by a reduction in investor relations  telephone  consulting fees  and travel expenditures

currently  all sunscreen and personal care nanomaterials are manufactured via the pvs process 
net cash provided by financing activities  is primarily due to the company securing financing through a private placement in and  and other financing agreements  and to a lesser extent by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of options and warrants  partially offset by principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations  amounting to  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on march   the company sold  in a private placement to altana   shares of common stock at per share and received gross proceeds of million 
on january  the company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to allow nanophase to offer up to million of nanophase securities  in the form of common stock or various types of debt securities  in the future 
the registration statement relating to these securities has not yet been declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
on september   the company secured equity funding through a private placement offering with grace brothers  ltd  its largest investor 
the company issued  shares of additional common stock at per share and received gross proceeds of million 
grace brothers  ltd 
also has the right to purchase an additional  shares for an additional million 
on may   the company secured equity funding through a private placement offering 
the company issued million shares of additional common stock at per share and received gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were approximately million after commissions  legal  accounting  and other costs 
the company intends to use the proceeds from the foregoing offerings to fund expected growth in new markets as well as to provide for expanded working capital needs expected to arise as sales volume grows 
the company s supply agreement with its largest customer contains several financial covenants which could potentially impact the company s liquidity 
the most restrictive financial covenants under this agreement require the company to maintain a minimum of million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  and no more than million in debt  in order to avoid triggering a transfer of technology and equipment to the company s largest customer 
the company had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and debt of less than million at december  management expects that the proceeds received from the may and september private placement offerings  as well as the proceeds from the march  equity investment from altana  should be sufficient to enable the company to comply with these financial covenants for the foreseeable future 
further  the company expects  although such events are not guaranteed  to receive at least some portion of an additional million in equity capital in relating to its january  universal shelf registration filing and an additional million in possible equity capital relating to the future exercise of warrants issued in its september fundraising prior to their expiration in september this additional funding should further allow the company to avoid the previously mentioned triggering event for the foreseeable future 
this supply agreement and its covenants are more fully described in note of the company s financial statements 
see risk factors we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
in november  the company executed a three year promissory note  held by the company s largest customer  in the amount of  for the construction of additional production capabilities at the company s romeoville  illinois facility 
borrowings against this note amounted to  at december  the note bears interest at per annum and is collateralized by certain powder coating  packaging  lab and related equipment 
contractually  the company has seventeen months to pay back this note  based on a rate per kilogram of product shipped  with any remaining outstanding balance at june  becoming payable on demand 
the company believes that cash from operations and cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand which includes the  in gross proceeds from the march  private placement and interest income thereon  will be adequate to fund the company s operating plans for the foreseeable 
table of contents future 
the company s actual future capital requirements in and beyond will depend  however  on many factors  including customer acceptance of the company s current and potential nanocrystalline materials and product applications  continued progress in the company s research and development activities and product testing programs  the magnitude of these activities and programs  and the costs necessary to increase and expand the company s manufacturing capabilities and to market and sell the company s materials and product applications 
other important issues that will drive future capital requirements will be the development of new markets and new customers as well as the potential for significant unplanned growth with the company s existing customers 
the company expects that capital spending relating to currently known capital needs in will be somewhat greater than the company s  in capital expenditures in  but could be even greater due to the factors discussed above 
should events arise that make it appropriate for the company to seek additional financing  it should be noted that additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  and any such additional financing could be dilutive to the company s stockholders 
such a financing could be necessitated by such things as the loss of existing customers  currently unknown capital requirements in light of the factors described above  new regulatory requirements that are outside the company s control  the need to meet previously discussed cash requirements to avoid a triggering event  or various other circumstances coming to pass that are currently not anticipated by the company 
the following table highlights the company s contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unfulfilled purchase orders totals at december   the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million for income tax purposes 
because the company may have experienced ownership changes within the meaning of the us internal revenue code in connection with its various prior equity offerings  future utilization of this carryforward may be subject to certain limitations as defined by the internal revenue code 
if not utilized  the carryforward expires at various dates between and as a result of the annual limitation and uncertainty as to the amount of future taxable income that will be earned prior to the expiration of the carryforward  the company has concluded that it is likely that some portion of this carryforward will expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce income tax liabilities 
at december   the company also had a foreign tax credit carryforward of  which could be used as an offsetting tax credit to reduce us income taxes 
the foreign tax credit will expire in  if not utilized before that date 

table of contents risk factors the following risks  uncertainties  and other factors could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  operating results  and growth prospects 
we have a limited operating history and may not be able to address difficulties encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we have only a limited operating history 
we were formed in november and began our commercial nanocrystalline materials operations in january we have not yet generated a significant amount of revenue from our nanocrystalline materials operations 
because of our limited operating history and the early stage of development of our rapidly evolving market  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and adversely affect our business and cannot be certain that our business strategy will be successful or that it will successfully address these risks 
in addition  our efforts to address any of these risks may distract personnel or divert resources from other more important initiatives  such as attracting and retaining customers and responding to competitive market conditions 
we have a history of losses that may continue in the future 
we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception with net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and presently expect to continue to incur losses on an annual basis through at least the end of we believe that our business depends  among other things  on our ability to significantly increase revenue 
if revenue fails to grow at anticipated rates or if operating expenses increase without a commensurate increase in revenue  or if we fail to adjust operating expense levels accordingly  then the imbalance between revenue and operating expenses will negatively impact our cash balances and our ability to achieve profitability in future periods 
we depend on a small number of customers for a high percentage of our sales  and the loss of orders from a significant customer could cause a decline in revenue and or increases in the level of losses incurred 
sales to our customers are executed pursuant to purchase orders and annual supply contracts  however  customers can cease doing business with us at any time with limited advance notice 
we expect a significant portion of our future sales to remain concentrated within a limited number of strategic customers 
we may not be able to retain our strategic customers  such customers may cancel or reschedule orders  or in the event of canceled orders  such orders may not be replaced by other sales or by sales that are on as favorable terms 
in addition  sales to any particular customer may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  which could affect our ability to achieve anticipated revenues on a quarterly basis 
sales to basf corporation  rohm and haas electronic materials formerly known as rodel and ci kasei  a division of itochu corporation  accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   and sales to the same three customers accounted for approximately of total revenue in for the years ended december  and  basf accounted for and of our total revenue  respectively 
if we were to lose  or receive significantly decreased orders from  any of these three customers  then our results of operations would be materially harmed 
while our agreements with our three largest customers are long term agreements  they may be terminated by the customer with reasonable notice and do not provide any guarantees that these customers will continue to buy our products 
in addition  while our agreements with our three largest customers contain minimum order requirements  the only repercussion under the agreements for missing the minimum order requirement is that we would be freed from the exclusivity obligations under these contracts 

table of contents we have been consistently expanding both our marketing and business development efforts and our production efficiency in order to address the issues of our dependence upon a limited amount of customers  enhancement of gross profit and operating cash flows  and the achievement of profitability 
we currently have customers that may grow to the point where they generate significant revenues and margins as relationships expand 
given the special nature of our products  and the fact that markets for them are not yet fully developed  it is difficult to accurately predict when additional large customers will materialize 
on a going forward basis  the company s margins  as a percentage of revenue  will be dependent upon revenue mix  revenue volume  and the company s ability to continue to cut costs 
the extent of the growth in revenue volume  and the related gross profit that this revenue generates  will be the main drivers in generating positive operating cash flows and  ultimately  net income 
any downturn in the markets served by us would harm our business 
a majority of our products are incorporated into products such as sunscreens  polishing slurries  personal care  and to a lesser extent abrasion resistant coatings for flooring  and catalytic converters 
these markets have from time to time experienced cyclical  depressed business conditions  often in connection with  or in anticipation of  a decline in general economic conditions 
these industry downturns have resulted in reduced product demand and declining average selling prices 
our business would be harmed by any future downturns in the markets that we serve 
our products often have long adoption cycles  which could make it difficult to achieve market acceptance and makes it difficult to forecast revenues 
due to their often novel characteristics and the unfamiliarity with them that exists in the marketplace  our nanocrystalline materials often exhibit longer adoption cycles than existing materials technologies 
our nanomaterials have to receive appropriate attention within any potential customer s organization  then they must be tested to prove a performance advantage over existing materials  typically on a systems cost basis 
once we have proven initial commercial viability  pilot scale production runs must be completed by the customer  followed by further testing 
once production level commercial viability is established  then our nanomaterials can be introduced  often to a downstream marketplace that needs to be familiarized with them 
if we are unable to convince our potential customers of the performance advantages and economic value of our nanocrystalline materials over existing and competing materials and technologies  we will be unable to generate significant sales 
our long adoption cycle makes it difficult to predict when sales will occur 
we depend on collaborative development relationships with our customers and do not have a substantial direct sales force 
if we are unable to initiate or sustain such collaborative relationships  then we may be unable to independently develop  manufacture or market our current and future nanocrystalline materials or applications 
we have established  and will continue to pursue  collaborative relationships with many of our customers and do not have a substantial direct sales force 
through these relationships  we seek to develop new applications for our nanocrystalline materials and share development and manufacturing resources 
we also seek to coordinate the development  manufacture and marketing of our nanocrystalline products 
future success will depend  in part  on our continued relationships with these customers and our ability to enter into similar collaborative relationships with other customers 
our customers may not continue in these collaborative development relationships  may not devote sufficient resources to the development or sale of our materials or may enter into collaborative development relationships with our competitors 
additionally  these customers may require a share of control of these collaborative programs 
some of our agreements with these customers limit our ability to license our technology to others and or limit our ability to engage in certain product development or marketing activities 
these relationships can usually be terminated unilaterally by customers 
if we are unable to initiate or sustain such collaborative relationships  then we may be unable to independently develop  manufacture or market our current and future nanocrystalline materials or applications 

table of contents in addition  the development agreements with some of our larger customers contain provisions that require us to license our intellectual property to these customers on disadvantaged terms and or transfer equipment to these customers in the event that we materially breach these agreements or fail to satisfy certain financial covenants 
for example  see risk factors we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
if a catastrophe strikes either of our manufacturing facilities or if we were to lose our lease for either facility due to non renewal or other unforeseen events  we may be unable to manufacture our materials to meet customers demands 
our manufacturing facilities are located in romeoville and burr ridge  illinois 
these facilities and some of our manufacturing and testing equipment would be difficult to replace in a timely manner 
therefore  any material disruption at one of our facilities due to a natural or man made disaster or a loss of lease due to non renewal or other unforeseen events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products to meet customers demands 
while we maintain customary property and business interruption insurance  this insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses that we may incur 
if we are unable to expand our production capabilities to meet unexpected demand  we may be unable to manage our growth and our business would suffer 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to manufacture nanocrystalline materials in significant quantities  with consistent quality and in an efficient and timely manner 
we expect to continue to expand our current facilities or obtain additional facilities in the future in order to respond to unexpected demand for existing materials or for new materials that we do not currently make in quantity 
such unplanned demand  if it resulted in rapid expansion  could create a situation where growth could become difficult to manage  which could cause us to lose potential revenue 
protection of our intellectual property is limited and uncertain 
our intellectual property is important to our business 
we seek to protect our intellectual property through patent  trademark  trade secret protection and confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  customers  suppliers and others 
our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate and others  including our competitors  may use our proprietary technology without our consent 
we may not receive the necessary patent protection for any applications pending with the us patent and trademark office and any of the patents that we currently own or license may not be sufficient to keep competitors from using our materials or processes 
in addition  patents that we currently own or license may not be held valid if subsequently challenged by others and others may claim rights in the patents and other proprietary technology that we own or license 
additionally  others may have already developed or may subsequently develop similar products or technologies without violating any of our proprietary rights 
if we fail to obtain patent protection or preserve our trade secrets  we may be unable to effectively compete against others offering similar products and services 
in addition  if we fail to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others or lose any license to technology that we currently have or will acquire in the future  we may be unable to continue making the products that we currently make 
moreover  at times  attempts may be made to challenge the prior issuance of our patents 
for example  we have received a petition to request a re examination proceeding filed by an unidentified party in the us patent and trademark office  or uspto  with respect to one patent relating to one of our nanoparticle manufacturing processes 
if a re examination is granted  we may not be successful in maintaining the scope of the claims of this patent during re examination 
if our patent claims are 
table of contents narrowed substantially by the uspto  the patent coverage afforded our nanoparticle manufacturing process could be impaired  which could impede the extent of our legal protection of the invention that is subject to this patent and potentially harm our business and operating results 
furthermore  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determinate the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if others assert that our technology infringes their intellectual property rights  resolving the dispute could divert our management team and financial resources 
in the future  we may license certain of our intellectual property  such as trademarks or copyrighted material  to third parties 
while we would attempt to ensure that any licensees maintain the quality and value of our brand  these licenses might diminish this quality and value 
we may be subject to claims that one or more of the business methods used by us infringe upon patents held by others 
the defense of any claims of infringement made against us by third parties could involve significant legal costs and require our management to divert time and other resources from our business operations 
either of these consequences of an infringement claim could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unsuccessful in defending any claims of infringement  we may be forced to obtain licenses or pay royalties to continue to use our technology 
we may not be able to obtain any necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or if these licenses are costly  our operating results may suffer either from reductions in revenue through our inability to serve clients or from increases in costs to license third party technology 
our industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology 
if we are unable to keep pace with these changes  our business will not grow 
rapid changes have occurred  and are likely to continue to occur  in the development of advanced materials and processes 
our success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to keep pace with advanced materials technologies  industry standards and market trends and to develop and introduce new and improved products on a timely basis 
we expect to commit substantial resources to develop our technologies and product applications and  in the future  to expand our commercial manufacturing capacity as volume grows 
our development efforts may be rendered obsolete by the research efforts and technological advances of others and other advanced materials may prove more advantageous than those we produce 
our market is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively  then our business will not grow 
the advanced materials industry is new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
the market for materials having the characteristics and potential uses of our nanocrystalline materials is the subject of intensive research and development efforts by both governmental entities and private enterprises around the world 
we believe that the level of competition will increase further as more product applications with significant commercial potential are developed 
the nanocrystalline product applications that we are developing will compete directly with products incorporating both conventional and advanced materials and technologies 
while we are not currently aware of the existence of commercially available competitive products with the same attributes as those we offer  other companies may develop and introduce new or competitive products 
our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing materials  technologies and better or less expensive products than the ones we offer 
in addition  many of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources  and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 
if we 
table of contents fail to improve our current and potential nanocrystalline product applications at an acceptable price  or otherwise compete with producers of conventional materials  we will lose market share and revenue to our competitors 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our manufacturing and marketing operations or we may need to obtain funds through arrangements on less favorable terms or we may be required to transfer equipment to our largest customer 
we expect to expend significant resources on research  development and product testing  and in expanding current capacity or capability for new business 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights 
if necessary  we may seek funding through public or private financing and through contracts with government or other companies 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our manufacturing and marketing operations or we may need to obtain funds through arrangements on less favorable terms 
if we obtain funding on unfavorable terms  we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our intellectual property 
to raise additional funds in the future  we would likely sell our equity or debt securities or enter into loan agreements 
to the extent that we issue debt securities or enter into loan agreements  we may become subject to financial  operational and other covenants that we must observe 
in the event that we were to breach any of these covenants  then the amounts due under such loans or debt securities could become immediately payable by us  which could significantly harm us 
to the extent that we sell additional shares of our equity securities  our stockholders may face economic dilution and dilution of their percentage ownership 
we currently have a supply agreement with basf that contains provisions which could potentially result in a mandatory transfer of technology and sale of production equipment to basf providing capacity sufficient to meet basf s production needs 
the transfer and related sale would be triggered only in the event that one of the following occurs our earnings for a twelve month period ending with our most recently published quarterly financial statements are less than zero and our cash  cash equivalents and investments are less than  any lender accelerates any debt in excess of  or we become insolvent as defined in the supply agreement 
in the event of a triggering event where we are required to sell to basf production equipment providing capacity sufficient to meet basf s production needs  the equipment would be sold at of the equipment s net book value 
we believe that we have complied with all contractual requirements and that we have not had a triggering event 
we further believe that the proceeds of the may  and september  private placements  in addition to the proceeds from the equity investment by altana on march   should provide sufficient cash balances to avoid the first triggering event referenced above for the foreseeable future 
further  we expect  although such events are not guaranteed  to receive at least some portion of an additional  in equity capital in relating to our january  universal shelf registration filing and to receive an additional  in possible equity capital relating to the future exercise of warrants relating to the september fundraising 
if a triggering event were to occur and basf elected to proceed with the transfer and related sale mentioned above  we would lose both 
table of contents significant revenue and the ability to generate significant revenue to replace that which was lost in the near term 
replacement of necessary equipment that would be purchased and removed by basf pursuant to this triggering event could take six months to a year 
any additional capital outlays required to rebuild capacity would probably be greater than the proceeds from the purchase of the assets pursuant to our agreement with basf 
this shortfall might put us in a position where it would be difficult to secure additional funding given what would then be an already tenuous cash position 
such an event would also result in the loss of many of the company s key staff and line employees due to economic realities 
we believe that our employees are a critical component of our success and would be difficult to quickly replace and train 
given the occurrence of such an event  we might not be able to hire and retrain skilled employees given the stigma relating to such an event and its impact on us 
we might elect to effectively reduce our size and staffing to a point where we could remain a going concern in the near term 
we depend on key personnel  and their unplanned departure could harm or business 
our success will depend  in large part  upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified research and development  management  manufacturing  marketing and sales personnel on favorable terms 
due to the specialized nature of our business  we may have difficulty locating  hiring and retaining qualified personnel on favorable terms 
if we were to lose the services of any of our key executive officers or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract and retain other skilled and experienced personnel on acceptable terms in the future  then our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially harmed 
in addition  we do not currently have key man life insurance policies covering all of our executive officers or key employees  nor do we presently have any plans to purchase such policies 
we face potential product liability risks which could result in significant costs that exceed our insurance coverage  damage our reputation and harm our business 
we may be subject to product liability claims in the event that any of our nanocrystalline product applications are alleged to be defective or cause harmful effects 
because our nanocrystalline materials are used in other companies products  to the extent our customers become subject to suits relating to their products  such as medical implants and cosmetic and skin care products  these claims may also be asserted against us 
we may incur significant costs including payment of significant damages  in defending or settling product liability claims 
we currently maintain insurance coverage in the amount of million for product liability claims  which may prove not to be sufficient 
even if a suit is without merit and regardless of the outcome  claims can divert management time and attention  injure our reputation and adversely affect demand for our nanocrystalline materials 
we are subject to governmental regulations 
the costs of compliance and liability for noncompliance with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
current and future laws and regulations may require us to make substantial expenditures for preventive or remedial action 
our operations  business or assets may be materially and adversely affected by governmental interpretation and enforcement of current or future environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in addition  our coating operations pose a risk of accidental contamination or injury 
the damages in the event of an accident or the costs to prevent or remediate a related event could exceed our resources or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  both of our facilities and all of our operations are subject to the plant and laboratory safety requirements of various occupational safety and health laws 
we believe we have complied in all material respects with regard to governmental regulations applicable to us 
however  we may have to incur significant costs in defending or settling future claims of alleged violations of governmental 
table of contents regulations and these regulations may materially restrict or impede our operations in the future 
in addition  our efforts to comply with or contest any regulatory actions may distract personnel or divert resources from other more important initiatives 
the manufacture and use of certain products that contain our nanocrystalline materials are subject to intense governmental regulation  including regulations promulgated by the us food and drug administration  the us environmental protection agency  and the us occupational safety and health administration 
as a result  we are required to adhere to the requirements of the regulations of governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
these regulations could increase our cost of doing business and may render some potential markets prohibitively expensive 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions which could discourage or prevent a takeover  even if an acquisition could be beneficial to our stockholders 
in october  we entered into a rights agreement  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
the provisions of this agreement and some of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could  together or separately discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control  and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in particular  our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock less any outstanding shares of preferred stock with rights and privileges that might be senior to our common stock  without the consent of the holders of the common stock  including up to  shares of series a junior participating preferred stock issuable under the rights agreement 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporations law and the terms of our stock option plans may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
future sales of our common stock by existing stockholders could negatively affect the market price of our stock and make it more difficult for us to sell stock in the future 
sales of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to complete future equity financings 
a substantial number of shares of our common stock and shares of common stock subject to outstanding warrants and options may be resold pursuant to currently effective registration statements 
as of march   there are  shares of common stock that have been issued in registered offerings  upon the exercise of options under our equity incentive plan or in private placements and are freely tradable in the public markets   shares of common stock that may be issued on the exercise of stock options outstanding and exercisable under our equity incentive plan   shares of common stock together with a warrant to purchase a like number of shares that were issued pursuant to the company s september  private placement and may be registered for resale pursuant the terms of the registration rights agreement executed in connection with this private placement  and 
table of contents  shares of common stock that were issued pursuant to the company s march  private placement and may be registered for resale after march  pursuant the terms of the registration rights agreement executed in connection with this private placement 
we cannot estimate the number of shares of common stock that may actually be resold in the public market because this will depend on the market price for our common stock  the individual circumstances of the sellers  and other factors 
if stockholders sell large portions of their holdings in a relatively short time  for liquidity or other reasons  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
bradford t 
whitmore has significant influence on all matters requiring stockholder approval because he beneficially owns a large percentage of our common stock  and he may vote the common stock in ways with which our other stockholders disagree 
as of march   bradford t 
whitmore  together with his affiliates  grace brothers  ltd 
and grace investments  ltd  beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result  he has significant influence on matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including proposals regarding any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  the election of members of our board of directors  and any amendment to our certificate of incorporation 
the ownership position of mr 
whitmore could delay  deter or prevent a change of control or adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
mr 
whitmore s interests may be significantly different from the interests of our other stockholders and he may vote the common stock he beneficially owns in ways with which our other stockholders disagree 
investors in the company should also note that r 
janet whitmore  one of our directors  is the sister of mr 
whitmore 
we have been involved in litigation 
if we are involved in similar litigation in the future  the expense of defending such litigation and the potential costs of judgments against us and the costs of maintaining insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
we have been involved in three securities class action lawsuits  one of which was a consolidation of several related lawsuits 
while all of these lawsuits have been settled and dismissed with all settlements funded by our directors and officers liability insurance  we may be the target of additional securities lawsuits in the future 
if we are involved in similar litigation in the future  the expense of defending such litigation  the potential costs of judgments against us  the costs of maintaining insurance coverage and the diversion of management s attention could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock markets in general  and the stock prices of technology based companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well 
our future financial performance and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenues in any given period relative to the levels expected by investors could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents dilutive effect of private placements 
on may  we sold  shares of our common stock to selected accredited investors at a purchase price of per share 
on may  the closing sale price of our common stock  as reported on nasdaq  was per share 
on september  we sold  shares of our common stock to grace brothers  ltd 
at a purchase price of per share together with a warrant to purchase a like number of shares of common stock during the next twelve months also at a price of per share
