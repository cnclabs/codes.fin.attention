the memphis  tennessee campus is accredited by coe 
the arlington  texas campus is accredited by abhes 
the remaining campuses are accredited by accsct 
accreditation by an accrediting body recognized by ed is necessary for a campus to be eligible to participate in federally sponsored financial aid programs 
see financing student education 
certain campuses have received accreditation or approval for specific programs from the following agencies the american society of health systems pharmacists  commission on accreditation of allied health education programs  joint review committee on education in radiologic technology  committee on accreditation for respiratory care  the commission on dental accreditation  the committee on dental auxiliaries california board of dental examiners  accreditation review committee on education in surgical technology  the california board of vocational nurse and psychiatric technician examiners  colorado board of nursing  texas board of nursing  florida board of nursing  and the missouri board of nursing 
program specific accreditation approvals are not necessary for participation in federally sponsored financial aid programs  however  they are required for certification and or licensure of graduates from some programs  such as the vocational or practical nurse and respiratory therapy programs offered by some of the campuses 
these accreditations or approvals have been obtained because management believes they enhance the students employment opportunities in those states that recognize the accrediting agencies 
the qualifications of faculty members are regulated by applicable accreditation associations and or agencies 
faculty standards must be met before the campuses accreditation is renewed 
in addition  faculty members teaching certain curriculum must meet standards set by applicable state licensing laws 
each campus is licensed as an educational institution under applicable state and local laws  and is subject to a variety of state and local regulations 
these regulations may include approval of the curriculum  faculty and general operations 
financing student education tuition and other ancillary fees vary from program to program  depending on the subject matter and length of the program 
the total cost per program ranges from approximately  to  part i page most students attending the campuses utilize federal government grants and or the federal family education loan programs available under the higher education act of hea  and various programs administered thereunder to finance their tuition 
each campus has at least one financial aid officer to assist students in preparing applications for federal grants and federal loans 
management estimates that during  of cash receipts were derived from funds obtained by students through these programs 
currently  each campus is an eligible institution for some or all of the following federally funded programs federal pell grant pell  federal supplemental education opportunity grant seog  federal perkins loan  federal parent loan for undergraduate students plus  federal stafford loan  federal unsubsidized stafford loan  and veterans administration assistance 
also  some students are eligible for assistance under the department of labor s workforce investment act 
the states of california  colorado  tennessee  florida  oregon  and texas each offer state grants to students enrolled in educational programs of the type offered by the campuses 
typically  many restrictions apply in qualifying and maintaining eligibility for participation in these state programs 
students principally rely on a combination of two federal programs federal pell grants and federal family education loans ffels also referred to as federal subsidized stafford  unsubsidized stafford  and plus loans 
federal subsidized stafford loans are need based and awarded annually to students studying at least half time at an approved postsecondary educational institution 
the maximum pell grant a student may receive for the award year is  the amount a student actually receives is based on a federal regulatory formula devised by ed 
ffels are low interest federal student loans provided by banks and other lending institutions  the repayment of which is fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the federal government through a guarantee agency 
the student pays no interest on a subsidized stafford loan while in school and for a grace period up to six months thereafter  on unsubsidized loans  interest accrues but is capitalized and added to the principal 
parents of dependent students can receive plus loans 
there is no interest subsidy for plus loans 
the parent borrower is responsible for all interest that accrues on the loan while the student is in school 
for both subsidized and unsubsidized loans  students do not need to begin payment until expiration of a six month grace period following last day of attendance 
after such time  repayment is required in monthly installments  with a variable interest rate 
lenders making subsidized ffels receive interest subsidies during the term of the loan from the federal government  which also pays all interest on these ffels while the student attends school and during the grace period 
in the event of default  all ffels are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by state or private guarantee agencies which  in turn  are reimbursed by the federal government according to the guarantee agency reinsurance provisions contained in the hea 
state and federal student financial aid programs are subject to the effects of state and federal budgetary processes 
there can be no assurance that government funding for the financial aid programs in which the company s students participate will continue to be available or maintained at current levels 
the loss or reduction in funding levels for state and federal student financial aid programs could have a material adverse effect on the company 
regulation both federal and state financial aid programs contain numerous and complex regulations which require compliance not only by the recipient student but also by the institution which the student attends 
the company monitors compliance through periodic visits to the individual campuses by corporate staff 
failure to materially comply with such regulations at any of the campuses could have serious consequences  including limitation  suspension  or termination of the eligibility of that campus to participate in the funding programs 
independent certified public accountants audit the campus administration of federal funds as mandated by federal regulations 
additionally  these aid programs require accreditation by the campuses 
see accreditation and licensing and financing student education 
one of ed s principal criteria for assessing a campus s eligibility to participate in student loan programs is the cohort default rate threshold percentage requirements the cohort default rate enacted in the student loan default prevention initiative act of the regulations apply to the ffel  and federal perkins loan program loans 
cohort default rates are calculated by the secretary of education and are designed to reflect the percentage of former students entering repayment in the cohort year  the fiscal year of the federal government october to september  who default on their loans during that year or the following cohort year 
this calculation includes only those defaulted loans on which federal guaranty claims have been paid 
a campus may request that a defaulted loan be removed from the calculation if the campus can demonstrate that the loan was improperly serviced and collected under guidelines established in ed s regulations 
a loan that is included in the default rate calculation may be subsequently paid by the student  but is not removed from the cohort calculation 
part i page after january   the secretary of education was authorized to initiate proceedings to limit  suspend or terminate the eligibility of an institution to participate in the ffel program if the cohort default rate for three consecutive years exceeds the prescribed threshold 
beginning with the release of cohort default rates in the summer of  a cohort default rate equal to or exceeding for three consecutive fiscal years may be used as grounds for terminating ffel eligibility 
the following table sets forth the   and cohort default rates for each of the campuses 
cohort default rates campus garden grove  ca denver  co jacksonville  fl kansas city  mo lauderdale lakes  fl memphis tn north hollywood  ca portland  or san bernardino  ca san diego  ca tampa  fl arlington  tx preliminary rates received february these rates are subject to change and may not be reflective of the final rates for the arlington campus began participating in the ffel program in july their first cohort year was october  to september  therefore  arlington only has a preliminary rate for all of the company s campuses have at least one of their three most recent rates below and are  therefore  eligible to participate in the ffel program 
the company maintains aggressive default management plans for each campus and monitors activity frequently 
staff at each campus and corporate office assist and educate student borrowers in understanding their rights and responsibilities as borrowers under these student loan programs 
in  ed established a policy of recertifying all institutions participating in title iv programs every five years 
provisional certification limits the campus ability to add programs and change the level of educational award 
in addition  the campus is required to accept certain restrictions on due process procedures under ed guidelines 
the kansas city campus received provisional certifications in that will expire in eight of the company s campuses have full certification 
four campuses currently have provisional certifications  kansas city  portland  and memphis  received provisional certification due to high federal perkins loan default rates 
in addition memphis was cited for ffel default rates 
the arlington campus was acquired by the company in august and received provisional certification due to the change of ownership 
the company does not believe provisional certification will have a material impact on its liquidity  results of future operations or financial position 
there has been no material impact due to provisional certification in prior years 
the company is subject to extensive regulation by federal and state governmental agencies and accreditation bodies 
in particular  the higher education act of hea  and the regulations promulgated thereunder by ed subject the campuses to significant regulatory scrutiny on the basis of numerous standards that campuses must satisfy to participate in the various federal student financial assistance programs under title iv of the hea 
to participate in title iv programs  an institution must be accredited by an association recognized by ed 
ed will certify an institution to participate in the title iv programs only after an institution has demonstrated compliance with the hea and the ed s extensive regulations regarding institutional eligibility 
under the hea  accreditation associations are required to include the monitoring of certain aspects of title iv program compliance as part of their accreditation evaluations 
congress must reauthorize the hea approximately every six years 
the most recent reauthorization in october reauthorized the hea until september  the hea reauthorization imposed a limit on the amount of title iv funds a withdrawing student can use to pay their education costs 
this limitation permits a student to use only a pro rata portion of the title iv program funds that the student would otherwise be eligible to use  if the student withdraws during the first of any payment period 
the institution must refund to the appropriate lenders or title iv programs any title iv funds that the institution receives on behalf of a withdrawing student in excess of the amount the student can use for such period of enrollment 
under this hea requirement  students are obligated to the company for education costs that the students can no longer pay with title iv funds 
the company implemented this requirement on october  as required by regulation 
the company monitors the increase in accounts receivable from students and its impact on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the company s provision for uncollectible accounts has increased as a result of this regulation 
ed issued a new financial responsibility regulation that became effective july  institutions are required to meet this regulation to maintain eligibility to participate in title iv programs 
this regulation uses a composite score based upon three financial ratios 
an institution demonstrates that it is financially responsible by achieving a composite score of at least  or by achieving a composite score in the zone from to and meeting certain provisions 
part i page an institution in the zone may need to provide to ed timely information regarding certain accrediting agency actions and certain financial events that may cause or lead to a deterioration of the institution s financial condition 
in addition  financial and compliance audits may have to be submitted soon after the end of the institution s fiscal year 
title iv hea funds may be subject to cash monitoring for institutions in the zone 
the company s composite score was   and in   and  respectively 
an additional hea standard prohibits an institution from providing any commission  bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment  admission or financial aid awarding activity 
the company believes that its method of compensating persons engaged in student recruitment  admission or financial aid awarding activity complies with the requirements of the hea 
the regulations do not  however  establish clear standards for compliance  and the company cannot assure you that ed will not find any deficiencies in our present or former methods of compensation 
congress is currently reviewing the current hea reauthorization which expires september  the company is not aware of any changes that may be made during reauthorization that will have a material financial impact on the company 
however  there can be no assurance of the impact of new regulations or requirements from reauthorization 
competition the campuses are subject to competition from public educational institutions in addition to a large number of other public and private companies providing postsecondary education  many of which are older  larger and have greater financial resources than the company 
management believes that the educational programs offered  the campus reputation and marketing efforts are the principal factors in a student s choice to enroll at a campus 
additionally  the cost of tuition and availability of financing  the location and quality of the campus facilities  and job placement assistance offered are important 
the specific nature and extent of competition varies from campus to campus  depending on the location and type of curriculum offered 
the company competes principally through advertising and other forms of marketing  coupled with specialized curricula offered at competitive prices 
employees as of december   the company had approximately full and part time employees  of which approximately were faculty members 
the company had management and administrative staff members employed at the campuses and employed at corporate headquarters 
the remaining employees are admissions personnel 
management and supervisory members of both the administrative staff and administrative faculty are salaried 
all other faculty and employees are paid on an hourly basis 
the company employs full time  part time  and on a substitute on call basis 
the company does not have an agreement with any labor union representing its employees and has not been the subject of any union organization efforts 
risk factors any of the following risks could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
failure to comply with extensive regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
failure of the company s campuses to comply with extensive regulations could result in financial penalties  loss or suspension of federal funding 
the company s revenue is derived almost entirely from tuition  textbook sales  fees and charges paid by  or on behalf of  the company s students 
a large number of the company s students paid a substantial portion of tuition and other fees with funds received through student assistance financial aid programs under title iv of the hea 
the company received approximately of cash receipts from such funds for the year ended december  to participate in such programs  an institution must obtain and maintain authorization by the appropriate state agencies  accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the ed  and certification by the ed 
as a result  the company s campuses are subject to extensive regulation by these agencies that  among other things  requires the company to undertake steps to assure that the students at each of our campuses do not default on federally guaranteed or funded student loans at a rate of or more for three consecutive years  part i page limit the percentage of revenues derived at each campus from federal student financial aid programs to less than  adhere to financial responsibility and administrative capability standards  prohibit the payment of incentives to personnel engaged in student recruiting  admissions activities or awarding financial aid  and achieve stringent completion and placement outcomes for short term programs 
these regulations cover virtually all phases of the company s operations  including the company s educational programs  facilities  instructional and administrative staff  administrative procedures  financial operations and financial strength 
they also affect the company s ability to acquire or open additional campuses or change the company s corporate structure 
these regulatory agencies periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements 
if one of the company s campuses were to violate any of these regulatory requirements  the company could suffer a financial penalty 
the regulatory agencies could also place limitations on or terminate the company s campuses receipt of federal student financial aid funds  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company believes that the campuses substantially comply with the requirements of these regulatory agencies  but the company cannot predict with certainty how all of these requirements will be applied  or whether the company will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future 
some of the most significant regulatory requirements and risks that apply to the company s campuses are described in the following paragraphs 
the us congress may change the law or reduce funding for federal student financial aid programs  which could harm the company s business 
the us congress regularly reviews and revises the laws governing the federal student financial aid programs and annually determines the funding level for each of these programs 
congress must reauthorize hea approximately every six years 
the most recent reauthorization occurred in and reauthorized the hea until september  any action by congress that significantly reduces funding for the federal student financial aid programs or the ability of the company s campuses or students to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
legislative action may also increase the company s administrative costs and burden and require the company to modify the company s practices in order for the company s campuses to comply fully with applicable requirements  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
congress is currently reviewing the current hea reauthorization which expires september  the company is not aware of any changes that may be made during reauthorization that will have a material financial impact on the company 
however  there can be no assurance of the impact of new regulations or requirements from reauthorization if the company does not meet financial responsibility standards  the company s campuses may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
to participate in the federal student financial aid programs  an institution must either satisfy numeric standards of financial responsibility  or post a letter of credit in favor of the ed and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs 
currently  none of the campuses are required to post a letter of credit in favor of the ed or accept other conditions on its participation in the federal student financial aid programs due to failure to satisfy the numeric standards of financial responsibility 
the company cannot assure you that the company or the company s campuses will satisfy the numeric standards in the future 
the campuses may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs if their student loan default rates are too high 
an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the federal student financial aid programs if defaults by its students on their federal student loans exceed specified rates 
if any of the company s campuses  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs because of high student loan default rates  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
part i page campuses may lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial paid programs if the percentage of their revenue derived from those programs is too high 
a proprietary institution loses its eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs if it derives more than of its revenue from these programs in any fiscal year the regulation 
if any of the company s campuses  depending on its size  loses eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
the company received approximately  from federal student financial aid programs during  representing of the total cash received on ffel eligible programs 
individual campuses rates ranged from a low of to a high of in if the company fails to demonstrate administrative capability to the ed  the company s business could suffer 
ed regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
these criteria require  among other things  that the institution comply with all applicable federal student financial aid regulations  have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs  provide financial aid counseling to its students  and submit all reports and financial statements required by the regulations 
if an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria  the ed may require the repayment of federal student financial aid funds  transfer the institution from the advance system of payment of federal student financial aid funds to the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring  place the institution on provisional certification status  or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit  suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in federal student financial aid programs 
should one or more of the company s campuses be limited in their access to  or lose  federal student financial aid funds due to their failure to demonstrate administrative capability  the company s business could be materially adversely affected 
regulatory agencies or third parties may commence investigation  bring claims or institute litigation against the company 
because the company operates in a highly regulated industry  the company may be subject from time to time to investigations  claims of non compliance  or law suits by governmental agencies  or third parties  which may allege statutory violation  regulatory infractions  or common law causes of action 
if the results of the investigations are unfavorable to the company or if the company were unable to successfully defend against third party lawsuits  the company may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines  penalties  injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
even if the company adequately addresses the issues raised by an agency investigation or successfully defend a third party lawsuit  the company may have to devote significant money and management resources to address these issues  which could harm the company s business 
if regulators do not approve the company s acquisitions  the ability of the acquired institution to participate in federal student financial aid programs would be limited 
when the company acquires an institution  ed and most applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies consider that a change of ownership or control of the institution has occurred 
a change of ownership or control of an institution under the standards of ed may result in the temporary suspension of the institution s participation in the federal student financial aid programs until the ed issues a temporary certification document 
if the company were unable to reestablish the state authorization  accreditation or ed certification of an institution the company acquired  depending on the size of that acquisition  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
if regulators do not approve transactions involving a change of control  the institutions acquired may lose their ability to participate in federal student financial aid programs 
if the company or any of the company s campuses experience a change of control under the standards of applicable state agencies or accrediting agencies or the ed  the company or the affected campuses must seek the approval of the relevant agencies 
the failure of any of the company s campuses to reestablish its state authorization  accreditation or ed certification would result in a suspension or loss of federal student financial aid funding  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
part i page the ed  applicable state education agencies or applicable accrediting agencies may consider other transactions or events to constitute a change of control 
some of these transactions or events  such as a significant acquisition or disposition of the company s common stock  may be beyond the company s control 
if the company s campuses do not maintain their state authorizations and accreditations  they may not operate or participate in federal student financial aid programs 
an institution that grants degrees  diplomas or certificates must be authorized by the relevant agencies of the state in which it is located and  in some cases  other states 
requirements for authorization vary substantially among the states 
state authorization and accreditation by an accrediting agency recognized by the ed are also required for an institution to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
loss of state authorization or accreditation by any of the company s campuses  depending on the size of the campus  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
failure to effectively manage the company s growth could harm the company s business 
the company expects to acquire new campuses as a component of its strategy for growth 
the company regularly engages in evaluations of possible acquisition candidates  including evaluations relating to acquisitions that may be material in size and or scope 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to identify educational institutions that provide suitable acquisition opportunities or to acquire any such institutions on favorable terms 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that any acquired institutions can be successfully integrated into the company s operations or be operated profitably 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges  including the diversion of management s attention  assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired companies  adverse short term effects on reported operating results  possible loss of key employees and difficulty of presenting a unified corporate image 
continued growth through acquisition may also subject the company to unanticipated business or regulatory uncertainties or liabilities 
opening new campuses and adding new services could be difficult for the company 
the company expects to develop  open and operate new campuses  most likely as additional locations of existing campuses 
establishing additional locations would pose unique challenges and require the company to make investments in management  capital expenditures  marketing expenses and other resources 
because the company has not yet established any new additional locations  there can be no certainty as to the company s ability to be successful in any such endeavor 
any failure of the company to effectively manage the operations of newly established campuses could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to keep pace with changing market needs and technology could harm the company s business 
prospective employers of the company s graduates increasingly demand that their entry level employees possess appropriate technological skills 
educational programs at the company s campuses must keep pace with these evolving requirements 
if the company cannot respond to changes in industry requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition 
competitors with greater resources could harm the company s business 
the postsecondary education market is highly competitive 
the company s campuses compete with traditional public and private two year and four year colleges and universities and other proprietary schools  including those that offer distance learning programs 
some public and private colleges and universities  as well as other private career oriented schools  may offer programs similar to those of the company s campuses 
although tuition at private nonprofit institutions is  on average  higher than tuition at the company s campuses  some public institutions are able to charge lower tuition than the company s campuses  due in part to government subsidies  government and foundation grants  tax deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to proprietary schools 
some of the company s competitors in both the public and private sectors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce the company s ability to grow 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain adequate funding to complete any potential acquisition or new campus opening or that such an acquisition or opening will succeed in enhancing the company s business and will not ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a number of the company s shares of common stock will be eligible for future sale  which may cause the company s stock price to decline 
the exercise of substantial amounts of options or registration of common stock or the perception that such sales or registration might occur could cause the market price of the company s common stock to decline 
on december   the company had  shares of the company s common stock outstanding 
as of december   options to purchase part i page  shares of the company s common stock were outstanding  of which approximately  were exercisable as of such date at an average exercise price of 
this concentration of stock options  relative to the amount of common stock outstanding  if exercised  will have a dilutive effect on the company s earnings per share which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
from time to time  the company may issue additional options to the company s employees under the company s existing stock option plan and under any new plans the company may adopt
