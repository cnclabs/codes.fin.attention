overview we operate two business segments  a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel business 
our retailing segment consists of our urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people stores 
in addition  urban outfitters and anthropologie offer merchandise through our direct to consumer operations  which consist of a catalog and web site for each of these brands 
our wholesale segment consists of our free people wholesale division 
our fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  our fiscal ended on january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least twelve full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented 
retail stores as of january   we operated urban outfitters stores urban retail of which were located in the united states  in canada  in the united kingdom  in scotland and in ireland 
during fiscal we opened eight new urban retail stores  all of which are located within the united states except for one store  which we opened in london 
urban retail targets young adults aged to through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment 
our product offering includes women s and men s fashion apparel  footwear and accessories  as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts 
we plan to open many additional stores over the next several years  some of which may be outside the united states 
urban retail s north american and european store sales  accounted for approximately and of consolidated net sales  respectively  for fiscal we operated anthropologie stores as of january   all of which were located in the united states 
during fiscal we opened new anthropologie stores 
anthropologie tailors its 
table of contents merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged to our product assortment includes women s casual apparel and accessories  home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items 
we plan to open many additional stores over the next several years 
anthropologie s store sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal our free people retail store is located in paramus  new jersey and primarily offers free people branded women s merchandise targeted to young contemporary women 
we plan to open a limited number of additional stores over the next several fiscal years  including one to two stores in fiscal free people s sales accounted for less than of consolidated net sales for fiscal we plan to open approximately to stores during fiscal  including one to two new free people stores 
the remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between urban retail and anthropologie 
our goal thereafter is to increase net sales to per year through a combination of opening new stores  growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations 
direct to consumer in march  anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise most of which is also available in our anthropologie stores 
during fiscal  anthropologie catalog circulation was over million 
furthermore  we believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the anthropologie brand identity with our target customers 
we plan to expand circulation to more than million catalogs during fiscal and continue to modestly increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years 
anthropologie operates an internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers 
the web site  www 
anthropologie 
com  debuted in december the web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel  accessories  household and gift merchandise 
as with our catalog  we believe that the web site increases anthropologie s reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of anthropologie s store operations 
in march  urban outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our urban outfitters stores 
the circulation of the catalog exceeded three million during fiscal we believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness 
based on an overwhelmingly positive customer response to the catalog  we plan to expand circulation to approximately eight million catalogs in fiscal urban outfitters also operates an internet web site that accepts orders directly from consumers 
the web site  www 
urbn 
com  was launched in may the web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the store 
as with the urban outfitters catalog  we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers as well as helps to support the strength of urban outfitters store operations 
we plan to test a new free people web site during the second half of fiscal we believe this site will further expose consumers to our free people product assortment 
direct to consumer sales were approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal wholesale the free people wholesale division designs  develops and markets young women s contemporary casual apparel 
our range of tops  bottoms  sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through 
table of contents approximately  better department and specialty stores  including bloomingdale s  marshall fields  macy s west  urban outfitters and our own free people store 
free people wholesale sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates 
our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales  net of estimated customer returns 
payment for merchandise at our stores  and through our direct to consumer business is by cash  check  credit card  debit card or gift card  therefore  our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges 
deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
these custom orders  typically for upholstered furniture  have not been material 
gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption for merchandise 
inventories we value our inventories  which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria utilized by the company to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise  the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle  and merchandise currently priced 
table of contents below original cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
inventories as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets 
any significant unanticipated changes in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements as well as furniture and fixtures and are included in the property and equipment  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report 
store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements 
the typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years 
furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over five years 
net property and equipment as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of these assets  we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type eg  mall versus free standing  store location eg  urban area versus college campus or suburb  current marketplace awareness of the urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which  in general  is assumed to be within three years from the date a store location has opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
for fiscal  and  we had no write downs of long lived assets 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories 
we determine our provision for income taxes based on tax legislation currently in effect 
legislation changes currently proposed by certain states in which we operate  if enacted  could increase the transactions or activities subject to tax 
any such legislation that becomes law could result in an increase in our income tax expense  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
deferred tax assets as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery is at risk  we must establish valuation allowances 
to the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents we have valuation allowances of million as of january  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries and capital loss carryforwards 
in the future  if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions or to realize off setting capital gains becomes apparent  we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances if required 
accounting for contingencies from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period

the increase in comparable store net sales was comprised of a increase for urban retail and a increase for anthropologie 
the increase in net sales attributable to noncomparable and new stores was the result of opening new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal that are considered noncomparable during fiscal comparable store net sales increases were principally the result of an increase in the number of transactions and average sales prices resulting from higher initial markons and a lower proportion of markdowns 
comparable store sales continue to significantly exceed our plan  thus far during fiscal direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to additional customer response related to the initial circulation of three million new urban outfitters catalogs and increased traffic to the urban outfitters web site 
anthropologie also contributed to the 
table of contents direct to consumer net sales growth by increasing circulation of the anthropologie catalog to approximately million catalogs  including a new winter essentials catalog  increased traffic to the anthropologie web site  and an improvement in the average order value 
gross profit margins increased to of net sales in fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal improvements to initial margins due to better sourcing and a reduction in markdown requirements accounted for the majority of the increase

direct to consumer net sales increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in the average catalog and web order value and additional customer response related to an increase in catalog circulation for anthropologie  including a new summer essentials catalog 
the urban retail web site also contributed to the direct to consumer net sales increase as a result of increased site traffic and an improvement in average order value

liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as of january  as compared to million as of january  and million as of january  increases in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities since january  were primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities 
in april  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering 
in conjunction with the offering  certain selling shareholders exercised options  which resulted in additional cash proceeds of approximately million 
during the last three years  we have mainly satisfied our cash requirements through our cash flow from operations and the proceeds generated from the public offering of our common shares 
our primary uses of cash have been to open new stores and purchase inventories 
we have also continued to invest in our direct to consumer efforts and in our united kingdom and ireland subsidiaries
