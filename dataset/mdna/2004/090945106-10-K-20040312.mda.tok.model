see forward looking statements 
overview founded in  biosite incorporated is a leading provider of novel  rapid medical diagnostics that improve a physician s ability to diagnose critical diseases and health conditions 
in selecting market opportunities  we primarily target large categories of disease that lack accurate or timely diagnostic methods 
currently  we offer tests for drug screening  heart attack  chf  acute coronary syndromes  and certain bacterial and parasitic infections 
our products are principally sold to hospitals  which number approximately  in the united states 
to market our products  we utilize a direct sales team that focuses its efforts primarily on larger centers with more than beds and smaller hospitals that are high volume users of our products 
the fisher healthcare division of the fisher scientific company  or fisher  distributes all of our products in us hospitals and supports our direct sales force  particularly in smaller hospitals 
in july  we signed a two year distribution agreement with fisher that extends the existing distribution relationship through december  sales to fisher represented and of our product sales in and  respectively 
in may  we entered into a distributor relationship with pss world medical  inc to market our products to physician office practices 
physician sales services  or pss  which is pss world medical s physician business  distributes our products to physician office practices in the united states 
we also employ a field based network of clinically experienced individuals that support our direct sales force by providing pre and post sale education and training 
in international markets  we have established direct selling efforts in several countries and utilize a network of country specific and regional distributors in other areas 
during and early  we initiated direct sales and distribution operations in france  germany  belgium and the united kingdom and  over the next few years  we may transition the distribution of our products in some additional european countries to a direct sales and distribution basis 
during  we experienced significant growth in key financial performance indicators  such as revenues  operating income and earnings per share 
we also achieved other equally important non financial performance milestones such as expansion of our manufacturing capacity  product and process development milestones and infrastructure improvements 
significant challenges in included effectively and efficiently scaling up our manufacturing capacity in a short period of time and adjusting to the impact of additional competition 
we have reported consecutive quarterly operating profits since the third quarter of  after incurring quarterly operating losses during the prior seven quarters 
our operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly or annual basis in the future and our growth or operating results may not be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts 
we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future 
some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and future operating results are discussed in the section entitled risk factors and in our discussion below under the heading liquidity and capital resources 
in  our net revenues were million  representing a increase over this growth resulted largely from increased sales of our triage bnp test 
the test  launched domestically in  was the first blood test available to aid in the detection of chf and benefited from a semi exclusive position in the market  until the entry of direct competition in june the triage bnp test is currently one of several fda cleared tests used as an aid in the diagnosis of chf 
bayer  roche diagnostics and axis shield plc  the manufacturing partner for abbott laboratories  have received fda clearance at various times since november we have experienced  and continue to experience  competition from these companies and anticipate competition from others in the future 
beginning in the third quarter of  we experienced significant competition  primarily from bayer  resulting in a loss of customers desiring to utilize an automated immunoassay system to perform bnp testing 
in december  we received fda clearance to market our triage bnp test for beckman coulter immunoassay systems and began selling the product in the united states in january a customer can perform bnp testing using either our rapid  portable triage meterplus system or any of beckman coulter s automated immunoassay testing platforms 
our competitors may succeed in developing or marketing products that are more effective or commercially attractive than the triage bnp test 
moreover  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully with these and other competitors in the future 
with several diagnostics commercialized  our focus has expanded to include the search for proprietary disease markers that can potentially be applied to our testing platforms or to platforms marketed by other diagnostic companies with whom we might collaborate 
to that end  in we launched biosite discovery 
through biosite discovery  we leverage our expertise in phage display antibody development to access protein targets via collaborations with clinical institutions or commercial companies  and also access targets via internal research and licensing programs 
we have the capacity to offer antibody development services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking high affinity antibodies for use in their drug research 
in return  we seek diagnostic licenses to their targets  as well as potential fees for deliverables  milestones and royalties 
biosite discovery has also attracted the interest of leading clinical collaborators  who provide patient samples and assist in the analysis of clinical data 
critical accounting policies involving management estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates  and related disclosures  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales upon shipment  including to fisher and our other distributors  unless there are significant post delivery obligations or collection is not considered probable at the time of shipment 
generally  we do not have any significant post delivery obligations associated with our product sales 
we accrue for warranty costs and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience  trends and estimates 
our collaborative development agreements generally contain specific payments for specific activities or elements of the agreements 
among the payments we might receive under the agreements are up front technology access fees  research funding  antibody development fees upon the delivery of antibodies  annual maintenance fees on targets for which we have produced antibodies for as long as the targets remain in development by our collaborators  milestone fees on drug targets that reach certain development milestones and royalties should products successfully be commercialized as a result of the collaboration 
up front technology access fees are recognized over the term of the agreement or ongoing research period  as applicable  unless we have no further continuing performance obligations related to the fees 
research funding is recognized over the applicable research period on a straight line basis  which approximates the underlying performance 
milestone payments  such as antibody development fees and clinical milestones  are recognized when earned  as the milestone events are substantive and their achievability is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
contract revenues that are based on the performance of and collection by our collaborators or their partners are deferred until such performance is complete and collection is probable 
we believe that each payment element of these agreements represents the fair value of the element at the date of the agreement 
the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
warranty reserve 
our warranty allowance primarily relates to warranty coverage extended with the placement of the triage meterplus 
the allowance is established at an amount net of any warranty costs that would covered by lre  the manufacturer of the triage meterplus 
historical experience and trends detailing returns and replacement activity in total and those that have been covered by lre s manufacturer s warranty are used in estimating our warranty allowance 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential uncollectible accounts receivable arising from our customers inability to make required payments 
our estimate is determined by analyzing historical bad debts  customer payment history and patterns  customer creditworthiness  and economic  political or regulatory factors affecting the customer s ability to make the required payments 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
net inventories are valued at the lower of the first in  first out  or fifo  cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
we utilize a standard cost system to track our inventories on a part by part  full absorption cost basis 
adjustments are made to the standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs on a fifo cost basis 
the estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
during our manufacturing processes  some work in process inventories require additional testing or re work 
these inventories are separately tracked and reviewed on a monthly basis to determine their status and an estimated reserve for potential scrap is calculated 
intangible and other long lived assets 
at december   we had approximately million of long lived assets  including million of land  million of building construction in progress  million of leasehold improvements  million of equipment and million of capitalized license rights 
leasehold improvements  equipment  intangible assets and certain other long lived assets are amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the remaining lease term 
we lease nine buildings in the united states with leases that expire between march and december useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue directly or indirectly 
license rights related to products for sale are amortized to cost of sales over the life of the license  not to exceed ten years  using a systematic method based on the estimated revenues generated from products during the shorter of the license period or ten years from the inception of the license 
the estimated revenues used as the base by which we amortize the license rights only includes estimated sales for products we are currently selling and does not include any estimated product sales expected to be realized during the license amortization term from products still in development today 
our intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
results of operations years ended december  and product sales 
product sales by product family were as follows in thousands year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease product family cardiovascular products triage bnp test products triage cardiac panel and cardio profiler products triage meterplus products other products triage drugs of abuse and tox drug screen products triage microbiology products total product sales product sales for increased to million from million in the increase in total product sales was primarily attributable to the million growth in net sales of our triage bnp test 
due to significant fluctuations in customer demand for the triage bnp test  including a significant acceleration in december  distributor inventory levels of some of our products were below targeted stocking levels at december  and may in other periods be above targeted stocking levels 
we adjust our manufacturing capacity to meet our changing estimates of production demand through the management of the number of production shifts we operate and through the implementation of additional automated manufacturing equipment 
product sales in future quarters to our distributors will be impacted as we and our distributors attempt to adjust the distributors inventories to targeted stocking levels and as we improve our effectiveness and efficiency in adjusting our manufacturing capacity and output 
our product sales are also impacted by the buying patterns of the distributors and other customers 
as a result of acceleration of customer demand for our triage bnp test in december and early  we are increasing our production capacity during the first quarter of net sales of our cardiovascular products  consisting of our triage bnp test  triage cardiac panel  triage cardio profiler and the triage meterplus  totaled million for  as compared to million for our cardiovascular products net sales growth of was primarily due to growth in sales volume of our triage bnp test 
our product sales growth rate for our triage bnp test in future periods will likely be lower than in past periods because of increased competition from alternative tests that aid in the diagnosis of chf 
in addition  as the market for bnp testing matures and more competitive products become available  our average sales price for our triage bnp test may decline 
net sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel  triage tox drug screen  triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were approximately million for  compared to million for the net sales increase of these products was primarily due to the growth in sales volume of our triage tox drug screen that was partially offset by a decrease in our average net selling prices of our triage drugs of abuse panel products 
we believe that the domestic sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel products may continue to decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more prominent in a maturing market 
the triage tox drug screen was launched in the united states in february contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of revenues associated with our research and development and licensing arrangements  including license fees  milestone revenues  royalties  research funding and antibody fees 
contract revenues for were million  compared to million for contract revenues recognized during consisted primarily of research funding  antibody fees and milestone revenues 
in june  we entered into an alliance with medarex inc under the terms of the agreement  we receive research funding of million per year over eight years from medarex  along with research fees and  if any products are generated through the collaboration  milestone payments and royalties 
we recognized  of research funding from the alliance with medarex during each quarter of and other contract revenues recognized during and included license fees  antibody fees  and amortization of up front technology access fees 
the decrease in contract revenues during  compared to  resulted primarily from the grant of a non exclusive license from us to a company for certain proprietary technology in no license fees were recognized in biosite discovery activities are performed and its costs are incurred by certain of our research and development departments 
these biosite discovery research and development resources concurrently focus on programs for our collaborators  which generate our contract revenue  and on internal research and development programs 
costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were approximately million for  as compared to approximately million for these costs are included in research and development expenses 
cost of product sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in gross profits increased primarily due to an overall increase in product sales 
the overall gross margin for was  compared to for during  in response to the rapid product sales growth trend for the triage bnp test  we made significant investments to expand our production capacity through the addition of production shifts  facility improvements  and implementation of automated and semi automated equipment  in order to ensure our ability to satisfy anticipated customer demands and maintain customer satisfaction 
as a result of changes in sales expectations for the third and fourth quarters of  we scaled back our production during that time 
consequently  our increased manufacturing costs were spread over a smaller than anticipated production volume  contributing to lower gross margins in the third and fourth quarters of than in the same periods of the decrease in the overall gross margin in also resulted from the changing mix of our sales of products  which have different gross margins 
our cardiovascular products have lower gross margins than our triage drugs of abuse panel 
sales of our cardiovascular products represented and of our product sales for and  respectively 
our newer products are expected to continue to realize lower gross margins than our triage drugs of abuse panel 
although our gross profits may continue to grow  we expect our overall gross margins to continue to fluctuate as a result of our fixed manufacturing costs being spread over changing production volumes and the changing mix of net sales of products with different gross margins 
additionally  our gross margins may continue to decrease as a result of competitive pricing pressures 
we have in the past  and may again  experience inefficiencies as we adjust our manufacturing capacity and production output to meet estimated product demand  and as we implement automated and semi automated equipment in our manufacturing processes 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in the increase in sg a expenses was primarily associated with the formation of our direct sales and distribution operations in france and germany  as well as the addition of sales  clinical education and technical service resources in the united states  expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines and scale up in additional markets such as physician offices  marketing activities relating to new products  increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations and higher performance based compensation  such as sales commissions and bonuses based on our financial performance 
we expect sg a expenses in to be higher than in  as we continue to increase our sales  marketing  administration  clinical education and technical service resources  as well as continue to build our direct sales and distribution infrastructure in europe 
a significant portion of the increase in sales and field support resources occurred during the latter half of the year and is expected to contribute to the growth we anticipate in we also expect to expand our overall operations  including sales and marketing program activities for our new products  continued expansion of our direct sales operations in europe and administrative support functions and infrastructure 
the timing of such increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the commercial success and sales growth of our products 
research and development expenses r d expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in during and  our research and development resources were focused primarily on new product development  the development of potential improvements to our existing products and manufacturing processes  and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
expenses related to the performance of our obligations associated with earning our contract revenues were incurred by our research and development group  primarily biosite discovery 
the increase in r d expenses during was primarily related to increased r d activities as well as increased performance based compensation resulting from our performance versus our beginning of the year goals 
we expect our research and development expenses for to be higher than in the increased expenditures will relate primarily to product development efforts  including the potential development of diagnostic products for stroke  shortness of breath and acute coronary syndromes  clinical studies  a platform development program intended to miniaturize the triage meterplus  biosite discovery  and scale up activities associated with potential new products 
the timing of the expenditures and their magnitude depends primarily on the progress and success of research and development and the timing of potential product launches 
license and patent disputes 
expenses associated with license and patent disputes incurred during totaled million 
we did not incur any such expenses during the expenses consisted primarily of legal costs related to our litigation with xoma ltd 
and its affiliates  or xoma 
in september  we announced that we resolved all outstanding disputes regarding patent and licensing issues with xoma so as to permit each the freedom to operate its business  and the related legal proceedings have been dismissed 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted primarily from lower interest income from our cash equivalents and marketable securities due to an overall decline in interest rates and a lower average balance of cash and marketable securities during compared to provision for income taxes 
as a result of the pre tax income and the tax credits generated in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for our annual effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
for  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million 
years ended december  and product sales 
product sales for increased to million from in the increase in total product sales was primarily attributable to the million growth in net sales of our triage bnp test 
net sales of our cardiovascular products  consisting of our triage cardiac panel  triage bnp test and the triage meterplus  totaled million for  compared to million for the net sales growth of our cardiovascular products of was primarily due to growth in sales volume of our triage bnp test 
net sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel  triage tox drug screen  triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were approximately million for  compared to million for the net sales decrease of these products was primarily due to a decrease in our average net selling prices that was partially offset by an increase in sales volume of these products 
contract revenues 
contract revenues for were million  compared to million for contract revenues recognized during consisted primarily of license fees  research funding and antibody fees 
we recognized  during each quarter of and of research funding from our alliance with medarex 
other contract revenues recognized during and included license fees  antibody fees  and amortization of up front technology access fees 
the increase in contract revenues during  as compared to  resulted primarily from the grant of a non exclusive license from us to a company for certain proprietary technology 
costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were approximately million for  as compared to approximately million for these costs are included in research and development expenses 
cost of product sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in gross profits increased primarily due to an overall increase in product sales 
the overall gross margin for was  compared to for the decrease in the overall gross margin primarily resulted from the changing mix of net sales of our products that have different gross margins  and from manufacturing inefficiencies experienced as we increased our manufacturing capacity by adding production shifts and implementing semi automated and automated manufacturing equipment into the manufacturing processes

sales of our cardiovascular products represented and of our product sales for and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in the increases in sg a expenses was primarily associated with the addition of sales  clinical education and technical service resources  expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines  additional marketing activities relating to new products  increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations and higher performance based compensation  such as sales commissions and bonuses based on our financial performance 
research and development expenses r d expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in during and  our research and development resources were focused primarily on new product development  the development of potential improvements to our existing products and manufacturing processes  and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
the increase in r d expenses during was primarily related to increased r d activities as well as increased performance based compensation resulting from our performance versus our beginning of the year goals 
license and patent disputes 
expenses associated with license and patent disputes incurred during totaled million  compared to million for the expenses consisted primarily of legal costs related to our litigation with xoma 
no expenses associated with the xoma litigation were incurred prior to may interest and other income  net 
interest and other income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower interest income from our cash equivalents and marketable securities due to overall decline in interest rates  offset by the higher average balance of cash and marketable securities during compared to provision for income taxes 
as a result of the pre tax income and the estimated tax credits generated in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for for  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through cash from operations  private and public placements of equity securities  debt and capital lease financing  cash received under collaborative agreements and interest income 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during was largely attributable to cash used in the purchase of land for the construction of our new corporate complex  offset by cash generated by operating activities of million 
in october  we completed a two part escrow closing to purchase land for the construction of our new corporate complex 
we purchased a total of usable acres for approximately million 
through december   we have expended an additional million for the design and construction of the new corporate complex 
we expect the new complex will provide us with up to  square feet of space and will be constructed in phases as needed 
the first phase will provide us with approximately  square feet of space 
the total cost of the land and construction costs of the first phase is estimated to be approximately million 
we currently plan to finance the construction of the complex using a combination of available cash balances and debt financing  if necessary 
we may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we expect the first phase of construction to be completed in the first quarter of and do not anticipate expanding our operations to the new facility prior to then 
we expect our occupancy costs to increase primarily due to increased square footage 
should there be a downturn in our business or the markets in which we compete  we may not have a need to expand our facilities as we have planned 
as a result  we may then seek an alternative use for all or a portion of the property  or seek to sell the property  which may have a negative impact on our operating results 
cash generated from operating activities in totaled million 
the primary contributor to cash generated from operating activities was our net income for of million 
cash generated from operating activities also included increases in accounts payable  accrued employee expenses  income taxes payable  and accrued liabilities totaling approximately million and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
other sources of cash included the receipt of million in proceeds from equipment financing and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our stock plans of million 
other significant uses of cash during included expenditures for design and construction of our new corporate complex of million  leasehold improvements and capital equipment of approximately million and principal payments under equipment financing debt arrangements of million 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during was largely attributable to cash generated from operating activities of million 
the primary contributor to cash generated from operating activities was our net income for of million 
cash generated from operating activities also included increases in income taxes payable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling approximately million and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
other sources of cash included the receipt of million in proceeds from equipment financing and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our stock plans of million 
significant uses of cash during included expenditures for leasehold improvements and capital equipment of million  principal payments under equipment financing debt arrangements of million and additional escrow deposits totaling  related to the purchase of land for our future corporate complex 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  are for the construction of the new corporate complex  support of our commercialization efforts related to our products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources  improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  facility expansion  new product development  clinical studies  and the continued advancement of research and development efforts 
we executed agreements to license technologies patented by others that call for milestone payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
we may enter into additional licensing agreements that may include up front and annual cash payments  milestone payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
we utilized and may continue to utilize credit arrangements with financial institutions to finance the purchase of capital equipment 
as of december   we had an equipment financing line of credit with a financial institution for million  of which million was available for future borrowings 
the line of credit expires on september  additionally  we may utilize cash generated from operating activities  if any  to meet our capital requirements 
we believe that our available cash  cash from operations and funds from existing credit arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy our funding needs for at least the next months  except for the potential funding requirement of a portion of the construction cost of our new corporate complex 
we have used available cash balances to purchase of the land for our new corporate complex and pay for the design and construction costs to date 
for the remainder of the construction costs  we plan to utilize a combination of available cash and debt financing  if necessary 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our new products and products under development are successfully developed  gain market acceptance and become and remain competitive  the timing and variability of significant orders  seasonal or unanticipated changes in customer demand  regulatory changes  uncertainties or delays  the costs  timing and effectiveness of further expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities and resources  expansion of our manufacturing capacity and biosite discovery activities and our facilities expansion needs  the ability to execute  enforce and maintain license and collaborative agreements and attain the milestones under these agreements necessary to earn contract revenues  the timing and results of research and development efforts including clinical studies and regulatory actions regarding our potential products  changes in third party reimbursement policies  and the costs and timing associated with business development activities  including potential licensing of technologies patented by others 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms  when needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  this table should be read in conjunction with item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt operating lease obligations new corporate complex construction commitments purchase obligations total purchase obligations include commitments to purchase components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products  and other recurring purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital expenditure requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily from our investments in available for sale marketable securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivatives instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
during the last half of and into  we significantly expanded our direct sales and distribution operations in france  germany  belgium and the united kingdom  and we may expand into additional countries in the future 
sales and costs resulting from our direct sales and distribution operations in europe are denominated in local currencies and are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
during  the euro to us dollar currency exchange rate increased to euro per us dollar 
significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively impact our consolidated sales and earnings 
international sales and operations are also subject to a variety of other risks  including difficulty in staffing  monitoring and managing foreign operations  reduced flexibility and increased cost of staffing adjustments  longer collection cycles  greater risk of uncollectible accounts  unknown or changes in regulatory practices  including import or export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  adverse tax consequences  including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries  political  social or economic conditions and changes in these foreign markets  and government spending patterns 
further  we purchase our triage meterplus inventory from lre in euros  and we incur employee and other operating costs in foreign currencies 
as a result  our costs will fluctuate along with the currencies and general economic conditions in the countries in which we do business  which could harm our operating results 
in prior years  we have on occasion purchased forward exchange contracts to manage this exposure to exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
total receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies as of december  were not material
