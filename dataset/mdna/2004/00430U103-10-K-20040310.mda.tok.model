results of operations compared to total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  change revenues software license  service and other drug discovery total revenues software license  service and other revenue for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
revenue in europe and the united states declined in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenue in asia increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenue decreased in modeling and simulation in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   while informatics revenue declined by in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the overall decrease in revenue was due primarily to closed consortia  pricing pressure across all customer types and  particularly in the bioinformatics and materials science sectors  delays and deferrals in customers purchasing decisions and fewer renewals of annual licenses  attributable to changes in customers business focus from research activities toward development efforts 
pdd revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase of million in milestone and license revenue offset almost entirely by a million decrease in service revenue 
in  we recorded a million increase in revenue resulting from a change in our estimate of costs required to complete a contract 
excluding the revenue from milestones and license fees and the adjustment  service revenue decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease resulted from decreased lead optimization revenue due to the expiration of a collaboration agreement

research and development expense decreased by to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  software research and development expense consists primarily of the employment related costs of personnel associated with developing new products  enhancing existing products  testing software products and developing product documentation 
pdd research and development expense includes the employment related costs of scientific staff working on unfunded internal drug discovery projects focused on the creation of new small molecule therapeutics 
software research and development expense is capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
capitalized software development costs consist primarily of the employment related costs and consulting fees paid to consultants in relation to the development of accelrys products that have not yet been released 
the following table shows the breakout of research and development costs by division and the amount of capitalized software development for the periods indicated for the years ended december  change research and development gross software development costs capitalized software development costs internal drug discovery total research and development costs the decrease in research and development expenses was attributable to  among other things  cost efficiencies realized at accelrys due to the consolidation of research efforts  cost reductions implemented in  increased capitalization of software development activities due to increased products in development  and increased resources allocated to pdd collaborations which expense is included in the determination of gross margin as described above 
sales  general and administrative expense decreased by to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease in sales  general  and administrative expenses was attributable to the restructuring undertaken in the third quarter of  and additional cost reduction initiatives implemented by management in the year ended december  during  the company terminated a facility lease  the expected remaining obligation under which had been included in the restructuring provision taken in the year ended december   and finalized certain remaining severance obligations 
as such  the company reversed an excess portion of the restructuring liability in the amount of the company incurred million for transaction costs associated with the spin off of pdd during the year ended december  the company expects to incur additional costs during the first calendar quarter of when the spin off of pdd is expected to be completed 
interest and other income  net  increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase was attributable to foreign exchange gains in the year ended december  the company recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the and tax provisions are primarily due to foreign taxable income generated by accelrys foreign subsidiaries 
these provisions differ from the federal tax rate primarily because of the effect of permanent book tax differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and net operating loss carrybacks 
as a result of the lower revenue and lower costs described above  the company generated a net loss of million per diluted share in the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million per diluted share in the year ended december  compared to total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  change revenues software license  service and other drug discovery total revenues software license  service and other revenue for the years ended december  and was million each year 
combined revenue including revenue from a strategic alliance in our largest geographic regions  europe and the united states was also consistent from year to year 
excluding the revenue from a strategic alliance  revenue in the combined european and us regions decreased by due to market conditions under which customers  particularly in the biotech sector  discontinued research  shifted their focus downstream to development  or went out of business 
revenue in asia increased  attributable to our direct sales in japan in compared to discounted distributor sales in revenue growth was in modeling and simulation including the revenue from the strategic alliance  while informatics revenue decreased by 
the decrease in informatics revenue was attributable primarily to the market conditions described above 
pdd revenue increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to additional revenue earned under collaborative drug discovery agreements  increased milestone revenue  and million from a revenue adjustment recorded in the third quarter of resulting from a positive change in our estimate of costs required to complete a contract 
milestone revenue recorded in the year ended december  and was million  and million  respectively 
excluding the revenue from milestones and the million adjustment  service revenue increased from year to year 
in and  one drug discovery customer accounted for and of consolidated revenue  respectively 
gross margin increased to million of related revenues for the year ended december  compared to million of related revenues for the year ended december  for the years ended december  change of revenue of revenue gross margin software license  service and other drug discovery total gross margin software license  service and other gross margin decreased to million of related revenue in the year ended december  compared to million of related revenue in the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to additional costs incurred related to enhancements of the post sales support function  and additional direct costs associated with revenue from a strategic alliance 
pdd gross margin increased to million of related revenue in the year ended december  compared to million of related revenue in the year ended december  the increase in gross margin resulted from the higher revenue level  including milestone revenue and the revenue adjustment  which carried only minor costs of revenue 
excluding the effect of the milestone revenue and the revenue adjustment on gross margin  total gross margin increased by  which is attributable primarily to planned cost reductions related to existing contracts and the effect of fixed costs spread over a larger revenue base 
cost efficiencies have been achieved on existing contracts and cannot be assured on future contracts 
research and development expense decreased by to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  software research and development expense consists primarily of the employment related costs of personnel associated with developing new products  enhancing existing products  testing software products and writing product documentation 
pdd research and development expense includes the employment related costs of scientific staff working on unfunded internal drug discovery projects focused on the creation of new small molecule therapeutics 
software research and development expense is capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
capitalized software development costs consist primarily of the employment related costs and consulting fees paid to consultants in relation to the development of accelrys products that have not yet been released 
the following table shows the breakout of research and development costs by division and the amount of capitalized software development for the periods indicated for the years ended december  change research and development gross software development costs capitalized software development costs internal drug discovery total research and development costs the decrease in research and development expense is attributable to cost efficiencies realized in the software business due to the consolidation of research efforts on accelrys expanded product line and due to efficiencies realized from standardization of products on a common platform 
also  decreased capitalization of software development activities resulted from these efficiencies 
additionally  cost decreases at pdd related to the reduction of non chemistry and biology research activities  were planned in and fully realized in sales  general and administrative expense increased by to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in sales  general and administrative expense is attributable largely to increases in sales staff and management infrastructure  particularly in japan where direct sales were undertaken in as compared to the former distributor sales model 
additionally  expense associated with a new facility and facility consolidation  severance  and excess consulting capacity in the current year totaled approximately million with no corresponding expense in the prior year 
finally  approximately million of the full year increase was attributable to the sales  general and administrative expense of synomics limited  acquired in june excluding the foregoing items  sales  general and administrative expense increased by 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of related to actions taken to improve our financial performance 
no goodwill amortization was recorded in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to changes in accounting rules 
no discontinued acquisition costs were recorded in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  interest and other income  net  decreased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  interest and other income  net  in the comparable prior year period included a million capital gain related to the sale of an investment 
approximately million of the decrease is due to decreases in average investment balances and decreases in market interest rates  and the remaining difference relates to translation of certain current assets denominated in foreign currencies and other non operating expenses 
the company recorded an income tax provision of million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the and tax provisions are primarily due to foreign taxable income generated by accelrys foreign subsidiaries 
these provisions differ from the federal tax rate primarily because of the effect of permanent book tax differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and net operating loss carrybacks 
hardware re sale operations were discontinued in as such  there was no net income from discontinued hardware operations for the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  as a result of the factors described above  the company generated a net loss of million per diluted share in the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million per diluted share in the year ended december  net loss in the prior year period was made up of a net loss from continuing operations of million per diluted share partially offset by income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our activities to date primarily through the sales of equity securities  and sales of software licenses  software maintenance services  and drug discovery services 
we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million as of december  compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
cash provided by operations increased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million the year ended december  the increase was due to the decreased operating loss  offset by increased receivables due to the timing of increased sales closer to the end of the year ended december  as compared to the end of the year ended december  cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the decrease resulted from decreased expenditures for information technology infrastructure offset by the timing of investments in marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities  excluding purchases of treasury stock of million in  decreased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million used in the year ended december  these amounts primarily represented cash proceeds to the company from stock option exercises 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases total the company pays royalties to approximately thirty six partners for worldwide licenses to enhance and market certain software developed at universities  corporations  and other institutions 
a majority of the royalty agreements are long term or perpetual in nature and the royalty obligations are generally based on a percentage of revenues derived from certain software license sales including associated sales of post contract support and maintenance 
the royalty agreements require quarterly payments and generally do not limit the maximum royalty amount under the agreement 
certain agreements contain provisions for quarterly and annual minimum royalty payments that total approximately million on an annual basis 
in   and  the company incurred related royalty expense of million  million  and million  respectively 
based on existing royalty agreements  the company expects to continue to incur about these levels of annual future royalty obligations 
we anticipate that our capital requirements may increase in future periods as a result of seasonal sales trends  additional research and development activities  and the acquisition of additional equipment 
our capital requirements may also increase in future periods as we seek to expand our technology platform through investments  licensing arrangements  technology alliances  or acquisitions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations at least through however  there can be no assurance that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before then 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including our ability to continue to generate software sales  our ability to extend existing drug discovery agreements and to enter into additional arrangements  competing technological and market developments  changes in our existing collaborative relationships  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the outcome of related litigation  the purchase of additional capital equipment  acquisitions of other businesses or technologies  and the progress of our customers milestone and royalty producing activities 
there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
our forecast for the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is forward looking information  and actual results could vary 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and disclosures involve the use of judgments and estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  as amended by sop and sop and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
we recognize accelrys software license revenue upon delivery if no significant obligations remain deliverable to the customer  the sales contract fee is fixed or determinable  amounts are due within one year and collection is probable  and when no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance exist 
customer payments received in connection with license sales are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as all of the above criteria are met 
prepaid post contract support and maintenance pcs revenue bundled with software license agreements is unbundled and deferred based on objective  vendor specific evidence 
pcs revenue is recognized pro rata over the related service period  which is generally one year 
consulting and training fees are recognized upon rendering of service 
support revenues are recognized ratably over the applicable contract periods or as services are performed 
amounts billed but not yet recognized as revenue  and other payments received prior to recognition of revenue  are recorded as deferred revenue 
we also recognize a limited amount or software license revenue on an annual subscription basis 
however  we are planning to offer more software licenses on terms which would require subscription accounting 
annual license revenue under an annual subscription model will be recognized ratably over the license term 
this contrasts sharply with our typical annual license offering  in which we recognize of the license revenue in the quarter in which the license is executed and amortize the other of the revenue over the remaining term of the contract to reflect the costs of post sales support 
the revenue recognition for the new license is even more dramatic when compared to our traditional perpetual license offering  in which we recognize of the license revenue in the quarter in which the contract is executed and amortize the remaining of the revenue over the term of a one year maintenance agreement 
for example  under our existing annual license structure  if we were to enter into a one year license generating  in revenue  we would have recognized  of the revenue when the software was shipped and recognized the remaining  of the revenue ratably over the contract term 
similarly  in the case of our existing perpetual license offering  completed on similar terms  we would have recognized  of the revenue when the product was shipped and the remaining  of the revenue ratably over the term of the one year maintenance agreement 
in contrast to both our annual and perpetual license offerings  on similar terms  under the new license offering we would recognize only one twelfth of the revenue  or  in the month following shipment  and  in each of the remaining months during the term of the contract 
to further illustrate the point  if over the next twelve months we were to book the same amount of orders as in calendar  in the same mix of annual and perpetual licenses and at the same time during the quarter as in  total revenue recognized for those months would be about million lower than in the unrecognized revenue  amortized over the remaining term of the agreement  will be accounted for as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
we expect that  at the end of about five quarters from now  the significant impact of the subscription accounting for this new license offering on accelrys recognized revenue and deferred revenue will be largely ameliorated 
finally  we also earn software revenue under consortia agreements wherein several unrelated parties enter into a joint software development agreement with us 
these agreements are generally one to three years in length  require an annual membership fee  and contain best efforts development milestones 
customers receive a consortium membership  a software library  and related software and maintenance support 
the portion of consortium fees associated with the initial software library is recognized upon delivery  while consortium fees associated with consortium membership and software maintenance are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
we are not required to deliver specified products under the agreements and the consortium fees are generally non refundable 
if we are successful in developing software under a consortia agreement as described above  a non transferable license is typically awarded to the consortium members 
as described above  recognition of software licence  service and other revenue is dependent  in part  on management judgment 
since management s judgment is involved  changes in our estimates or assumptions could impact revenue recognition in the future 
drug discovery contract revenue is recognized either i ratably over the term of the agreement  which approximates the performance of services  for contracts specifying payment for services over a given period  or ii as services are performed under the agreement for contracts specifying payment on a per full time employee basis 
drug discovery revenue earned related to up front product and technology license fees is recognized in accordance with sab no 
issued by the sec  and eitf  revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
accordingly  amounts received under multiple element arrangements requiring ongoing services or performance by us are recognized over the period of such services or performance 
drug discovery revenue from milestones are recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at a comparable level to before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment would be recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the arrangement 
royalties  are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of various research and collaboration agreements 
as described above  drug discovery revenue recognition is based  in part  on estimates and assumptions by management that are subject to change depending on the contract 
as such  any change in our estimates could impact revenue recognition in the future 
software development costs we capitalize software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the cost of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
such costs are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
capitalized software costs are comprised of costs incurred in the development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products after technological feasibility has been established 
we amortize capitalized costs over the estimated product life  not to exceed three years from the date on which the product is available for general release 
the estimated product life may be reduced based on obsolescence or other factors  which could affect the carrying value of capitalized software and result in charges to operating results 
these estimates are based on management s judgment 
since management s judgment is involved  any change in our estimates could impact operating results in the future 
goodwill the company s goodwill resulted from acquisitions made by accelrys in and we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are assessed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment by comparing fair market value of the net assets of our software segment to the carrying value 
in making this annual assessment  which we do in the fourth calendar quarter  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
we completed our annual intangible asset impairment test during the quarter ended december   and concluded that the carrying value of our goodwill was not impaired 
continued economic weakness  unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units  and additional non temporary market capitalization declines may be indicative of goodwill impairment and cause us to perform additional valuation analyses for our reporting units prior to the next required annual assessment 
these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in charges for goodwill expense in the future 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  property and equipment  and capitalized software development costs for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
this requires us to estimate future cash flows related to these assets 
actual results could differ from these estimates  which may affect the carrying amount of assets and the actual amortization expense 
the company has identified no such impairment losses as of december  new accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   as well as for hedging relationships designated after june   excluding certain implementation issues that have been effective prior to this date under fasb statement no 
the adoption of this statement has not had a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks consisting primarily of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our international sales generally are denominated in local currencies 
in  of our consolidated revenue was derived from customers outside the united states including from customers in europe and from customers in the asia pacific region 
our exchange rate risk is greatest for dollar sterling  dollar euro and dollar yen fluctuations 
when deemed appropriate  we engage in exchange rate hedging transactions in an attempt to mitigate the impact of adverse exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   we had no hedging transactions in effect 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  we regularly invest excess cash in overnight repurchase agreements that are subject to changes in short term interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal 
our exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income earned on our investment portfolio  since we have minimal debt 
we ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds by limiting default risks  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments at december
