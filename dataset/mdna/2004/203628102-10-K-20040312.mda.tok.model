item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation management s discussion of financial condition and results of operations this discussion is being presented to provide a narrative explanation of the financial statements of community 
the purpose of this presentation is to enhance the overall financial disclosure and to provide information about historic financial performance as a means to assess whether past performance can be used to evaluate the prospects for future performance 
throughout this presentation  net income and yield on earning assets have been presented on a tax equivalent basis and balances represent average daily balances unless otherwise indicated 
all per share amounts have been restated to give effect to the stock split  issued in the form of a stock dividend  announced in the fourth quarter of during  community completed the acquisitions of several businesses  including abstracting company of york county abco  a title  settlement  and abstracting company april   erie financial group  ltd 
erie  a company providing mortgage origination services july   and your insurance partnership  an insurance agency group specializing in personal insurance services october  
all dollar amounts are presented in thousands  unless otherwise indicated 
forward looking statements periodically  community has made and will continue to make statements that may include forward looking information 
the corporation cautions that forward looking information disseminated through financial presentations should not be construed as guarantees of future performance 
furthermore  actual results may differ from expectations contained in such forward looking information as a result of factors that are not predictable 
financial performance can be affected by any number of factors that are not predictable or are out of management s direct control 
examples include the effect of prevailing economic conditions  unforeseen or dramatic changes in the general interest rate environment  actions or changes in policies of the federal reserve board and other government agencies  business risk associated with the management of the credit extension function and fiduciary activities 
each of these factors could affect estimates  assumptions  uncertainties and risk used to develop forward looking information  and could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations regarding future performance 
critical accounting policy adequacy of allowance management believes that the application of its accounting policies and procedures in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and the related provision for loan losses  should be considered to be a critical accounting policy to ensure the fair presentation of the corporation s financial statements 
community applies a systemic methodology in order to estimate the allowance for loan losses 
these methodologies incorporate management s judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio through a disciplined process that is consistently applied 
this process requires that a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio be performed on a quarterly basis 
this analysis includes a specific individual loan review for any and all loans that meet specific materiality criteria 
such loans are evaluated for impairment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sf as no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the portfolio is further stratified to analyze groups of homogenous loans with similar risk characteristics 
such loans are evaluated under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
management considers all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectability  as well as particular risks indigenous to specific types of lending 
the process is further designed to consolidate the aggregate loss estimates and to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the final results are reviewed and approved by executive management 
results are constantly validated by a review of trends associated with loan volume  delinquencies  potential concentrations  or other factors that may influence the methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses 
performance overview community completed another year of record performance in  reporting the highest net income and earnings per share in its history 
at the same time  community made significant progress in its continuing effort to evolve into a community focused financial services corporation  capable of delivering a competitive menu of services to meet the expanding needs of individuals and businesses within its marketplace 
community is committed to achieving the highest possible return to its shareholders  constrained by the need for both prudent management of critical risk factors and the continuing investment in infrastructure to ensure superior customer service and growth of the franchise 
net income reached million  an increase from the net income of million reported in similarly  diluted earnings per share reached  a improvement from the reported in return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe provide traditional benchmarks used to compare the relative operating performance of financial service companies 
at the end of  the corporation produced an roa of and an roe of  which were comparable to the performances of and  respectively  in the prior year 
community has established long term performance goals that are consistent with its emergence as a growing and vibrant competitor within its expanding footprint 
the performance during was consistent with these operating goals and generated favorable performance comparisons to similarly sized financial service companies operating within the northeast region of the united states 
performance for included double digit growth in loan volume and steady deposit growth that combined to yield a increase in net interest income 
non interest income was influenced primarily by the growth in fees associated with acquired businesses and with increases in new or existing banking products 
mortgage origination fees expanded due to demand from the existing bank delivery network and from the activity generated as a result of the midyear acquisition of erie 
title and settlement revenues grew at record levels throughout the year and were influenced by the flurry of origination activity and by the acquisition of abco 
community also recorded a million gain from the sale of a retail office  which is included in other income  as part of its ongoing office reconfiguration effort 
these and other factors provided a significant boost to non interest revenues 
aside from increases in the non interest revenue stream  a reduction in the provision for loan losses also contributed to improved performance 
community continues to monitor and manage its credit quality to minimize losses from credit activities 
finally  profitability was also influenced by growth in expenses that occurred as a result of the additional costs from acquired businesses  expenses associated with the expansion of the delivery network  and from other investments in the growth of the corporation 
economic climate the year began with the predictable uncertainty that accompanies geopolitical discord and the escalation of armed international conflict 
since the tragedies brought on by the world trade center attack in september of  americans have had to adjust to a new global reality that has made terror alerts and al qaeda a normal part of our national lexicon 
this new reality has had a dampening effect on economic growth 
beyond this backdrop of global tensions lie national  regional  and local economies within the united states that are more directly affected by international trends and events 
this vulnerability was particularly evident in the first half of  with escalation of military involvement in iraq and increased concern over the potential for further terrorist attacks 
the economic malaise in the first half of was even more directly affected by the overall business climate  which was characterized by lackluster stock market returns  increased skepticism associated with corporate scandals  and reduced capital spending within the commercial sector 
the impact of declining interest rates during was the most influential trend affecting the financial services industry 
for the second consecutive year  interest rates fell to the lowest levels in the last four decades 
this trend had its most significant impact on growth in net interest income  the largest source of revenue for most financial institutions 
the low rate environment was a catalyst for borrowing activity  particularly within the consumer sector 
since the demise of the bubble economy of the s  steady consumer confidence has been an important constant in sustaining the national economy 
the retail consumer s capacity and appetite for debt to accommodate the purchase of goods and services has helped forestall a deeper  more dramatic recessionary downturn 
the federal reserve board fed maintained an accommodative stance on interest rates throughout most of the year in order to preempt the effect of higher rates on economic growth 
the fed s interest rate posture was also responsive to an absence of inflationary concerns  forestalling the need to raise rates in order to suppress the adverse consequences of unchecked inflation 
these lower rates created unprecedented challenges to achieving growth in interest spread for most financial institutions 
the rate environment provided a stimulus for credit services  but also produced challenges associated with expanding the deposit base 
as interest rates declined  most financial institutions were forced to become less competitive on the pricing of deposit funding products 
late in the year  many of these products had reached practical floors  preventing meaningful downward repricing of deposit funding 
the pressure on net interest income was exacerbated by the inability to achieve higher loan pricing or identify favorable reinvestment opportunities within the bond markets to enhance net interest spread 
while lower interest rates constrained growth in net interest income  this trend had a positive impact on other areas of financial services industry performance 
the highest direct correlation between lower rates and higher performance occurred in the mortgage origination markets 
nationwide  housing starts grew to over million while total home sales reached a record high million in at the same time  the lower mortgage rates spurred another record level of mortgage refinancing 
this trend provided consumers with increased disposable income and helped sustain consumer confidence during a period of rising unemployment and stagnant economic trends 
lower interest rates also have the tendency to reduce the volume and severity of losses from credit activities 
affordable credit tends to mitigate the potential for borrower default  which can be expected to increase during sustained periods of higher interest rates 
late in the third and fourth quarters of  tentative signs of a modest economic recovery began to emerge 
unfortunately  some industry sectors continue to be influenced adversely by conditions largely beyond their control  thus reducing the potential for more robust improvement in near term profitability 
specific examples include the travel  airline  and telecommunications industries 
most industries also continued to be hamstrung by their inability to raise prices during a period that has been almost devoid of inflationary pressure 
many other sectors  such as the automobile and home construction industries  remained strong during the slowdown  but are unlikely to achieve another layer of sizeable gains in the near term  regardless of the pace of economic improvement 
as a consequence  the recovery  although welcome  is expected to be comparatively modest in magnitude 
community operates within a regional economy  and smaller local economies  that traditionally have been sheltered from major aftershocks produced by volatile swings in specific industry sectors or other subsets of the broader national economy 
community s diverse economic underpinnings provide a solid base that is less predisposed to broad expansions or deep slumps caused by the ebb and flow of global or national business cycles 
while the local economies are partially cushioned from these macro trends  they will never be totally buffered 
consequently  while community and the businesses and individual customers within its markets were affected by the overall downturn in the economy  those constituencies experienced only modest deterioration in employment and relative economic stability 
strategy community s stated operating focus is manifested in its marketing slogan  local people  local decisions 
its operating strategy centers around three guiding factors growth  diversity  and profitability 
during  community made substantial progress in each of these areas 
the growth of the community franchise was quantified several ways 
the absolute growth in loans and deposits  combined with deepening and expanding customer relationships provided an affirmation of the potential for franchise expansion 
community also made significant strides fortifying its presence in existing markets in during the year  community added three new offices  including a presence in northern maryland  and announced additional plans to open at least two new offices in at the same time  management has consistently reevaluated the viability of the delivery system  resulting in the sale of three offices over the last two years 
this ongoing evaluation of the delivery system has allowed for redeployment of both human and financial capital in more vibrant markets with higher potential for economic growth 
during this time  the entry of larger  less personable financial institutions into community s core markets via bank acquisitions has generated opportunities to gain market share and expand customer relationships 
diversity has been a hallmark of community s operating strategy 
improvements have been realized through introductions of new products and services  additions of acquired businesses  and execution of strategic partnerships with other financial services companies 
as an example  community has become a leading provider of title and settlement services inside its footprint 
in april   community added to its presence in the york  pa market by acquiring abco  a key provider of title services in this vital component of community s core banking market 
later in  the acquisition of erie added a leading provider of mortgage origination services in the york and northern maryland markets 
this transaction has doubled the previous mortgage origination capacity of the franchise and will provide efficiencies with community s legacy origination operations 
the corporation also added to its ability to deliver high quality insurance services to both commercial and retail customers 
the acquisition of your insurance partner  an insurance agency group with two offices in the heart of community s geographic footprint  adds capacity to the corporation s growing menu of insurance services 
improvements to fee based revenues were also achieved through the introduction of new  convenience driven banking services such as the overdrafthonor program 
as another testimony to the commitment to meeting customer needs  the corporation announced an innovative revenue sharing arrangement with bryn mawr trust company bryn mawr in late bryn mawr  which is headquartered in the affluent main line area of suburban philadelphia  has been in the trust and investment management services business for over years 
community  which historically has had a limited capability for delivery of these essential services to its existing customer base  now possesses access to the expertise and experience of a corporation that currently manages over billion in assets 
the net result of these growth initiatives and increased diversity of the revenue stream has been improved profitability 
this improved profitability was achieved while simultaneously improving credit quality and making the appropriate investment in the future growth of the franchise 
such investments will continue to exert pressure on the overall cost structure and will present challenges into and beyond 
emerging trends for the foreseeable future  net interest income will remain the most significant source of revenue for banks 
recent trends have resulted in pricing compression  creating a major challenge to future revenue expansion 
this convergence of trends  combined with increasing competition from both smaller and larger rivals  has constrained growth in this vital driver of performance 
entering  management had made substantial efforts to reposition both earning asset and funding sources to benefit from a gradual  measured rise in overall interest rates 
the fed s stimulative monetary policy  combined with the increasing federal budget deficit  is beginning to intensify conditions that could give rise to inflationary pressure and higher interest rates 
most economists agree that interest rates will begin to rise  perhaps as early as the third quarter of management has considered options to more aggressively extend loan or investment maturities to achieve higher asset yields  but continues to pursue a more moderate approach 
execution of a more aggressive approach could lead to unacceptable levels of interest rate risk to the long term revenue stream  particularly given the current proximity to a perceived low point in the interest rate cycle 
consequently  the potential for reprieve from the effects of interest rate compression remains subdued in the near term  placing increased emphasis on garnering market share and achieving absolute earning asset growth 
credit quality is vital to the financial performance of community based financial services companies 
the diversity of community s markets and the relative granularity of its loan portfolio make it somewhat less susceptible to adverse credit quality conditions that are systemic in nature 
during  community recognized net charge offs that were at their lowest level since the allowance for loan losses  the corporation s reserve to absorb credit risk within the existing loan portfolio  is near a five year high in terms of its coverage of non accrual loans 
absolute levels of non accrual loans saw marked reductions since the end of  providing further evidence of the bank s improving asset quality metrics 
continuous improvement in the level of other revenue sources has served to offset the pressure on net interest income experienced during this extended period of declining interest rates 
community s focus on the integration of new products and services has fueled this growth 
the strategic acquisitions and partnerships completed during have solidified existing capabilities in title insurance and settlement services  mortgage origination  and insurance agency services 
the recently announced plan to partner with bryn mawr trust company is expected to add new capabilities in the arena of investment management for higher net worth customers 
growth in these areas in could be limited  however  depending on the magnitude and velocity of market shifts 
for example  both title and mortgage origination revenues could be adversely influenced by a sudden and substantial spike in interest rates 
similarly  the record level of refinancing activity during the past two years is likely to moderate as interest rates rise 
increases in revenue from delivery of asset management services through bryn mawr is expected to occur gradually over a more extended time horizon  especially given the challenges associated with garnering market share in this segment of the financial services market 
the final major aspect of performance that will be influenced by emerging trends is operating expenses 
community s execution of its growth strategies has driven steady increases in operating expenses in two major areas 
first  expenses related to the new branch expansion over the last several years continued to influence operating expenses  especially in salaries  benefits and depreciation expense 
this ongoing investment in a measured expansion plan is critical to positioning community in both its core markets and in contiguous markets that are natural extensions of the franchise 
secondly  the corporation s efforts to expand the mix and volume of integrated services have also had the impact of increasing operating expenses as compared to historical levels 
these efforts have been correlated with synchronous programs designed to increase the revenue stream from both core banking and integrated services 
increases in the cost structure have always been predicated on management s assessment of market share growth potential  higher revenues  and improvements in both profitability and return on invested capital 
net interest income community s major source of revenue is derived from intermediation activities and is reported as net interest income 
net interest income is defined as the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest margin is a relative measure of a financial institution s ability to efficiently deliver net interest income from a given level of earning assets 
both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by the frequency  velocity  and extent of interest rate changes and by the composition and absolute volumes of earning assets and funding sources 
the following table compares net interest income and net interest margin components between and in thousands change yield yield yield amount rate amount rate amount rate interest income    interest expense    net interest income    interest spread impact of non interest fund s net interest margin interest rates interest rates profoundly influenced net interest income and profit performance during since the year  key interest rate indices began a steady pattern of decline 
in each of the last two years  it was assumed that rates had declined to levels at  or near  the trough in the interest rate cycle 
by  such rates had declined to levels not seen since the s 
entering  most rate forecasts reflected expectations that rates would begin to increase  though not dramatically  sometime in instead  buoyed by fed policy  rates continued on a descending path throughout most of the year  reaching yet another level of lows in most key indices 
to illustrate  the following graph provides a comparison of u 
s treasury rates for the key maturity intervals for both and the prior year 
graph omitted 
average us treasury curve months months year year year year year the various treasury indices  which are important interest rate barometers  declined across the board by virtually the same extent 
this ratable decline resulted in little change to the overall slope of the yield curve 
consequently  both earning asset yields and funding costs declined during the year 
general interest rate trends were crucial to both interest income and the interest expense results 
the incremental pricing of maturing investments  variable rate loans  and new loan relationships was correlated with the lower prevailing interest rates  increasing pressure on asset yields 
despite the decline in earning asset yields  interest income was stabilized during most of the year as earning assets were redeployed from lower yielding  maturing investments to comparatively higher yielding loans 
the increasing affordability of credit created increased demand for both business and consumer credit products  resulting in an overall increase in earning assets 
at the same time  most banks continued to benefit from an influx of deposit funding 
the paucity of competitive returns in either the equity markets or other investment yields made bank deposits a viable short term alternative given consumer preferences for liquidity in anticipation of future rate increases 
most consumers were understandably averse to commit funds into longer maturity instruments given the expectation of higher rates 
as a consequence  many banks were able to secure increases in deposit funding  despite that fact that many of the more liquid deposit products were priced at record low levels 
the net impact was that interest expense declined by while interest income declined by only  resulting in an increase in net interest income of nearly 
interest income earning assets interest income was million in  only slightly below the million recorded in  despite the fact that earning asset yields declined from to over the two year period 
earning asset growth  fueled principally by loan growth  forged a increase from million to million and helped to offset the compression that would normally accompany lower earning asset yields 
from to  earning assets grew million  including million in loans and million in portfolio investment securities 
growth in loans accelerated during the year and was funded by both runoff in the investment portfolio and by an million increase in the level of deposits  most of which occurred in community s successful power now offering 
as interest rates declined  community also sought opportunities to lock in low cost term funding 
with interest rates at historic lows  management selectively termed out certain short term borrowings to secure the benefits of the lower  longer term rates available during the year 
interest expense funding sources interest expense on deposits declined dramatically during and was a major contributor to the nearly increase in net interest income 
despite increases in loan mix and an overall increase in the level of earning assets  community was not able to achieve improvement in interest income due to the impact of lower rates 
fortunately  that same rate environment permitted most banks to reduce interest rates on deposit funding and enabled community to reduce its overall funding costs from million in to million in  a decline of almost million or 
simultaneously  most banks continued to enjoy an influx of deposit funding as consumers opted for the security and short term liquidity of bank deposits 
it is likely that this trend  at least in part  could be linked to corporate and mutual fund scandals  a lackluster stock market  low money market rates  and other developments that reduced consumer interest in these other alternatives 
total deposits grew by nearly million  the vast majority of which occurred in savings  power now and other accounts that were responsive to customer preferences for liquidity 
for the first time in several years  community realized no growth in its time deposit categories as consumers were reluctant to extend maturities for relatively unattractive rate premiums 
community also made strategic use of other forms of funding in order to meet the consistent demand for credit extension that occurred throughout the year 
incremental borrowing rates on federal funds  which are set by the federal reserve  influenced the pricing of all short term sources of funds and made these borrowings far less expensive than other funding sources 
community made strategic use of this source of liquidity within the risk parameters set forth in its asset liability management alco policies and procedures 
at various times during the year  community also increased its long term borrowings  which are composed principally of term funding available through the federal home loan bank programs 
the corporation experienced a increase in long term funding  which included the first full year of million in trust preferred instruments issued under a pooled arrangement in december of community executed an additional million in these instruments at the end of  bringing its total issuances to million 
the issuances were integrated with  and responsive to  the overall capital management policy discussed later in this presentation 
interest spread and net interest margin a financial institution s ability to effectively blend the impact of changing rates  shifting rate indices  customer preferences  and product development initiatives can be measured by the performance of interest spread  which is defined as the difference between earning asset yield and the cost of funding sources 
net interest margin combines the impact of interest spread with both investment of non interest bearing funding sources and management of non earning assets 
as a result of rate trends and other dynamics specific to community s balance sheet  the corporation reported a decline in net interest spread from in to in  and a decline in net interest margin from to over the same period 
the decline in margin was also linked to the impact of reduced contribution from non interest funding sources  which declined from to 
during periods of declining interest rates  the contribution from non interest funds to net interest margin is reduced since funds are invested at progressively lower rates 
during periods of rising rates  these funds can be expected to contribute to improvements in net interest margin 
quarterly performance the following table provides a comparison of earning asset yields  funding costs  and other information for each of the four quarters of and fourth third second first quarter quarter quarter quarter asset yield funding cost interest spread net interest margin net interest margin     fourth third second first quarter quarter quarter quarter asset yield funding cost interest spread net interest margin net interest margin     continuing a trend which has corresponded to the general decline in interest rates  quarterly net interest margin exhibited a steady decline throughout both and throughout  community experienced a steady  almost consistent decline in earning asset yields despite the benefits of a more concentrated mix of loans  whose yields normally exceed those of portfolio investments with comparable maturities 
the increase in the mix and volume of higher yielding loans tended to offset the overall reduction of interest income from lower offering rates since this improved mix had the impact of offsetting some of the adverse consequences of a lower rate environment on interest income 
funding costs also declined during  and such declines were more directly responsible for the improvement in net interest income for the first nine months of the year 
community s ability to improve either net interest income or net interest margin through further reductions in incremental pricing of deposits or other funding sources was minimized in the fourth quarter of  as a significant portion of the funding pool reached all time lows 
pricing of both loans and deposits is also subject to competitive pressures in the marketplace 
consequently  the short term potential for improving net interest margin or net interest income through further reductions in funding costs seems less likely in the current environment 
provision for credit losses for the second consecutive year  community reported a decline in the provision for loan losses  which reflected the steady improvement in the overall asset quality metrics of its loan portfolio 
the provision declined from million in to million in  while the relationship of the allowance for loan losses to loans declined from at december  to at the end of the provision  and the level of the allowance  were responsive to the changing credit quality conditions of both seasoned loans and the incremental risk inherent in a growing loan portfolio 
net charge offs during were only million  or of average loans  and reflected a significant decline from charge off levels of the past two years 
non accrual loans aggregated million  the lowest absolute level since the beginning of the coverage of these loans provided by the allowance reached  nearly equal to the high recorded at the end of see the section addressing the allowance for loan losses and asset quality of this discussion for additional information 
non interest income this increasingly vital component of the revenue stream grew substantially during as important steps were undertaken to solidify and expand community s integrated businesses and complementary banking services 
excluding the impact from sales of investment securities  non interest revenue grew  from million in to over million in the income recorded during  however  included two nonrecurring gains without which community would still have recorded an increase of  as adjusted for these items in both years 
amounts recorded in included a gain from the curtailment of a legacy  defined benefit plan in the third quarter and the recognition of a gain from the sale of an office  inclusive of both loans and deposits  in the fourth quarter 
community had recognized a similar gain from the sale of two offices and related deposits in the following is a summary of the various components of non interest income for both and  including the year over year increases related thereto change amount investment management and trust services  service charges on deposit accounts    other service charges  commissions and fees   insurance premium income and commissions   mortgage banking activities    other income   investment security gains   total    investment management and trust revenues include fees derived from the sale of various retail investment products annuities  brokerage services  mutual funds  etc and other fees related to community s limited trust department activities 
sales of investment products are facilitated under an arrangement with a national provider of these services 
consultative sales are conducted through the community office network 
this arrangement provides convenient access to alternative investment vehicles through licensed employees who live and work in the communities where customers conduct their normal banking business 
this service has facilitated a more holistic approach to meeting the expanding financial service needs of customers who live within community s footprint 
customers are increasingly comfortable with using trusted  competent employees who work within their primary financial institutions for this vital service 
while traditional trust fees showed a meaningful increase in  the vast majority of the increase in this category was derived from the sale of additional investment products to new and existing customers 
near term increases in this category will continue to be weighted toward sales of retail investment products 
in the future  the affiliated arrangement with bryn mawr trust company is expected to provide more competitive services to high net worth individuals as these product offerings are made available 
the most substantial increase in fees occurred in the area of service charges on deposits 
in the first quarter of  community provided a new service known as overdrafthonor 
under this carefully designed program  customers who so choose now have access to a service that facilitates payment of periodic overdraft items while simultaneously avoiding adverse credit history events 
fees from these services  which were not provided prior to  were responsible for virtually all of the increase in this category 
other service charges include interchange fees from community s vast atm network and debit card transactions 
community continues to boast an atm network of nearly atms  including those in place under a relationship with a local convenience store chain operating within the corporation s geographic footprint 
fees associated with non customer use of these convenient locations to facilitate cash withdrawal needs grew by more than since a more robust increase of was realized in the interchange fees associated with retail transactions conducted via the use of debit or credit cards 
nearly all of the increases in these sources of fee income resulted from increased usage and the consumer s growing acceptance of electronic mediums as a substitute for cash or check based transactions 
insurance premiums and commissions include agency based commissions from commercial and personal lines  fees from credit reinsurance activities related to consumer lending  and the revenue from title insurance and settlement activities conducted through community s title insurance subsidiary 
these fees  which rose by a total of thousand from to  included an increase of over thousand related to title based activities alone 
such increases were related to both the overall increase in mortgage loan originations  and to the addition of the abco franchise at the beginning of the second quarter of the remainder of the increase was related to the acquisitions of the insurance agencies during the year 
community continues to explore opportunities  through either acquisitions or strategic alliances  which will help develop a meaningful critical mass in this important financial service 
the single largest percentage increase in revenues occurred in income from mortgage banking activities 
the increase was related both to volume increases in purchase mortgages and refinancings  and to new volumes generated through the midyear acquisition of the erie subsidiary 
community has more than doubled its capacity to originate mortgages with the acquisition of erie and has become a more significant and efficient competitor in its core and extended maryland markets 
other income included gains from the sales of offices in both and a gain in excess of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of and related to the sale of the loans  deposits and physical location of a single community office 
in  community had recorded a thousand gain from the sale of two smaller offices 
both sales coincided with entry into markets with more favorable growth demographics 
other income also included a nonrecurring gain from the curtailment of a legacy pension plan in the third quarter 
with this action  community has made substantial progress toward uniform retirement benefit programs for current and prospective employees while simultaneously forestalling increased expenses from higher cost defined benefit plans 
security gains increased by nearly thousand from as efforts were made to identify opportunities to improve the duration or average yield of the portfolio at various times during the year 
the total gains of million recorded in included nearly million of gains related to sales of bank equity holdings 
non interest expenses total non interest expenses reached million in and reflected a increase  or million  from the million recorded in the growth was influenced by two major factors 
over of the increase of million  or million  was directly related to increased expenses from the integrated businesses acquired at different points during these increases included the expenses from abco  erie  and incremental insurance agency activity 
excluding the portion of the increase related to acquired businesses  operating expenses increased million or over expenses 
this second component of the increase was more directly related to the costs associated with expansion of the core banking franchise 
the following is a summary of the various components of change in operating expenses change from total change integrated businesses other amount salaries and employee benefits      net occupancy expense     marketing expense   telecommunications expense  other operating expenses   total      excluding that portion of the increase related to the additional expenses of businesses acquired in  community reflected significant increases in salary and employee benefits costs  occupancy expenses  and other operating expenses  including marketing and telecommunications 
since the end of  community has added a total of seven new banking facilities in new or existing markets while selling three offices in markets with less robust growth characteristics 
this selective expansion of the community banks franchise has had a significant influence on the operating expense structure 
at the same time  this expansion has also been an important catalyst for the growth in loan and deposit balances since the end of the single largest component of costs is salary and benefits  as these expenses represent nearly of total operating costs 
excluding the impact of salaries added from the acquired businesses  salary and benefit expenses grew nearly million from to of this increase  over million was attributed to the effect of the average salary increase and to a heavier reliance on employee incentives for sales of certain financial product offerings 
payroll taxes and employee insurance costs  which increased by nearly thousand  were influenced by personnel added in both banking and acquired businesses  and by increases in health insurance rates 
the remainder of the increase  less than million  was affected by personnel added as a result of the new community offices  the increased cost of the customer service center  and by the addition of new lenders for certain key growth markets 
as would be expected  occupancy expenses were also influenced by increased costs associated with community office expansion and rose by just over million 
the costs for offices added since the end of grew by almost thousand 
another thousand of increased costs were related to the first full year of operation of the southern operations center and by the expansion of the customer service center 
these initiatives had been undertaken in to improve the level of customer service to new and existing customers 
within the overall category of other operating expenses  marketing and promotional increased over thousand 
in its annual report  community announced its intention to increase its spending to accommodate a more significant level of marketing and advertising costs 
these costs were undertaken in order to increase community s market share in new markets and to preserve and expand share in its legacy communities 
expenses were related to expanded awareness  image and lead product advertising  especially in the first half of community also reflected a thousand increase in its communications and data connection expenses during the year  which included cost for upgrades of existing systems and the increased costs for its growing office network 
other operating expenses increased thousand and were principally related to the acquired businesses 
income taxes income taxes grew from million in to million in  an increase of nearly 
the increase was commensurate with the increase in pretax income and resulted in an effective tax rate of over  only slightly higher than the tax rate recorded in the relative mix of tax exempt income  which grew during  influences the level of effective income tax rates and remains the primary reason for the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal tax rate for corporations 
statement of condition overview at december   community s total assets reached almost billion  reflecting a change of almost from the nearly billion of assets recorded at the end of average assets grew to billion for and grew almost from average assets 
average balances of earning assets  loans and deposits grew  and  respectively 
community benefited from increased demand for credit in both the consumer and commercial sectors 
while consumer demand for credit was influenced by both low rates and steady consumer confidence  growth in the commercial sector was more directly related to community s ability to garner market share from larger  less nimble financial institutions 
the growth trends experienced in and in previous years continue to demonstrate community s commitment to staying close to its core markets and to using its local presence and responsiveness as a competitive advantage 
investments community has established corporate investment policies that address various aspects of portfolio management  including quality standards  liquidity and maturity limits  investment concentrations and regulatory guidelines 
the corporation s objective with respect to investment management includes maintenance of appropriate asset liquidity  facilitation of asset liability strategy and maximization of return 
compliance with investment policy is regularly reported to the board of directors 
community actively manages its investment portfolio and  accordingly  classifies all investment securities as available for sale 
under current policy  if management has the intent and the corporation has the ability to hold securities until maturity  securities are classified as held to maturity investments at the time of purchase and carried at amortized historical cost 
securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
such securities are intended to be used as part of community s asset liability management strategy  and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment risk and other factors affecting overall investment strategy 
during  the average balance in the investment portfolio grew from million to million  a growth rate of that  though substantial  was far less than the investment portfolio growth of that was experienced from to during  community had experienced robust deposit growth  particularly early in that year 
unfortunately  loan growth did not keep pace with deposit generation growth rates  creating additional liquidity that fueled growth in the investment portfolio throughout as community entered  loan demand for both commercial and consumer credits increased coincident with the demand created by steadily declining interest rates 
while deposit inflow remained significant into  it was less robust growth than experienced in the combination of investment runoff and the increasing deposit base provided more than adequate funding to keep pace with the loan growth rates 
consequently  community continued to experience growth in its investment portfolio between the two years 
the pretax unrealized net gain within the investment portfolio at december  was million 
as required  this fair value adjustment was reflected in other comprehensive income adjusted for income taxes in the stockholders equity section of the statement of condition 
near the end of  a new accounting pronouncement was issued that requires additional disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statements 
such disclosures relate to declines in the market value of specific securities that may be considered temporarily impaired pursuant to newly established criteria for identifying such securities 
of the total of million of investments included in community s portfolio at year end  securities aggregating over million were identified as having met the criteria necessary for disclosure 
the aggregate unrealized loss disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements is slightly in excess of million  nearly all of which was related to the extraordinary decline in interest rates on certain securities and its impact on the valuation of those securities 
such declines were not attributed to any perceived deterioration in an individual issuer s ability to meet the terms and obligations of the issuance and were more than offset by gross unrealized gains of just over million 
community has the ability and intent to hold such investments until their original maturity and fully expects that any unrealized losses will be recovered over the term of the investments

loans average loans reached million at the end of  a increase over the million of average loans recorded in the composition of loans between the two years was influenced by a number of factors  including the influence of lower interest rates 
the following presentation of loans at december for each of the past two years is an indication of the relative mix of loans included in the portfolio in thousands change amount commercial    commercial real estate    residential real estate    consumer    total    following a year of less robust commercial loan activity in  commercial borrowing began to increase dramatically during the second quarter of  and growth continued well into the second half of the year 
after the end of the first quarter  the steady declines in interest rate trends caused many borrowers  including those with prior relationships with competitors of community  to reevaluate their existing credit arrangements in search of improved funding terms and more responsive credit relationships 
community has consistently made efforts to position itself in the marketplace to ensure its ability to compete with large and small competitors alike 
as a result  the corporation was able to increase both its commercial and commercial real estate portfolios by nearly million on an aggregate basis 
much of the growth in the commercial sector was attributed to community s ability to acquire existing market share since business lending has been constrained on both a national level and in certain segments of community s market 
a portion of this growth also can be attributed to the addition of certain key lending personnel made available as a result of mergers of local financial institutions by out of market acquirers 
the single most significant source of loan growth occurred in consumer lending  particularly home equity lending  which grew by million between december  and the end of as part of community s effort to increase its visibility in core markets  a concerted effort was made to become a more effective consumer lender  including substantial increases in marketing and advertising efforts 
historically  community has been more widely known throughout its market as a lender to small and medium size businesses  with an emphasis on commercial mortgages and commercial loans secured by real estate 
in  community sought to leverage its office network as a channel for expanding consumer lending and to fulfill the consumer s appetite for convenient  accessible retail lending services 
consumer demand for credit was also aided by the high levels of consumer confidence and improved credit affordability experienced in the current interest rate environment 
these efforts were also aided by the growth achieved as a result of the expansion of the office network and sales efforts over the last several years 
residential real estate lending  which is composed primarily of loans to single family creditors  has experienced a steady decline as a result of the increasing accessibility of secondary market liquidity through mortgage banking activities 
community based banks continue to provide a convenient avenue for consumers to access funding for residential lending  but most new credits continue to be sold in the secondary market 
this strategy has reduced the interest rate risk associated with consumer preferences for long term  fixed rate lending  and continues to provide valuable liquidity for other forms of relationship lending 
allowance for loan losses and credit quality the following sets forth activity within the allowance for credit losses for the last three years 
balance at january     loans charged off    recoveries   provision charged to operations    balance at december     allowance for credit losses to loans the period between january  and december marked a period of adjustment in the credit quality profile of community banks  inc in the last three quarters of  emerging trends suggested that the risk profile of corporation s loan portfolio would experience steady improvement in the decline in both non accrual loans and in loans days or more past due provided indications of an improving picture of credit quality  despite dramatic increases in the overall loan balances 
during  further indications of these favorable trends continued to emerge  resulting in dramatic reductions in both net charge offs and additional reductions in the level of problem credits 
net charge offs were reduced to million  or of average outstanding loans  and compared favorably to the net charge offs of million  or  in the prior year 
non accrual loans  the most severe category of problem credits  declined from million in to million at the end of while loans days or more past due declined from thousand to thousand over the same period 
despite a decline in the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to loans from at year end to at the end of  the coverage of non accrual loans provided by the allowance increased from to over the two year period 
as a consequence of these and other critical factors  management was able to reduce the provision for loan losses from million in to million in the following sets forth loan loss experience for the last five years in thousands loans at year end  net of unearned income      average loans balance      balance  allowance for loan losses  january      loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural   real estate mortgage   consumer and other    total      loans recovered commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer and other total   net charge offs      provision for loan losses      balance  allowance for loan losses  december      net charge offs to loans at year end

balance of allowance for loan losses to loans at year end the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
a review as to loan quality  current macro economic conditions and delinquency status is performed on a quarterly basis 
the provision for loan losses is adjusted quarterly based upon current review 
the following table presents an allocation by loan categories of the allowance for loan losses at december for the last five years in thousands 
loans commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction real estate mortgage     installment      unallocated     balance      the amount of the allowance assigned to each component of the loan portfolio is derived from a combination of factors 
estimation methods and assumptions used in the process are reviewed periodically by both management and the board of directors 
the percentage of loans in each category above is included in the loan account composition table in appendix a to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  part ii item the corporation s allowance for loan losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio utilizing a consistent valuation methodology 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets its affiliates serve 
commercial and real estate loans are individually risk rated by the corporation s loan officers and periodically reviewed by independent loan review personnel 
consumer and residential real estate loans are generally analyzed in homogeneous pools utilizing historical loan charge off information 
to determine the allowance and corresponding loan loss provision  an amount is allocated to specific loans 
for certain commercial and construction loans  this amount is based upon specific borrower data and supporting collateral determined by reviewing individual non performing  delinquent  or potentially troubled credits 
for the majority of the loans that are individually reviewed for impairment  this analysis is based on a comparison of the loan s carrying amount to the net realizable value of the collateral 
the portion of the allowance attributable to specific impaired loans was thousand at december  the remaining commercial as well as consumer  and residential real estate loans are evaluated as part of various pools 
these pool reserves  generally are based upon historic charge offs and delinquency history  other known trends and expected losses over the remaining lives of these loans  as well as the condition of local  regional and national economies and other qualitative factors 
to ensure adequacy to a higher degree of confidence  a portion of the allowance for loan losses is considered unallocated 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable  for possible imprecise estimates in assessing potential losses on commercial loans or in the calculation of pool reserves  and for the extenuating influence of current factors  such as economic uncertainties 
this unallocated portion is available to absorb losses sustained anywhere within the loan portfolio 
the combined allocated and unallocated portions bring the total allowance to an amount deemed prudent and reasonable by management at that time 
risk elements the following sets forth information regarding various segments of the loan portfolio  collectively referred to as risk elements 
these segments include both nonperforming assets and those loans past due for days or more 
non performing assets include non accrual loans  restructurings  and other real estate 
non accrual loans are loans for which interest income is not accrued due to concerns about the collection of interest and or principal 
restructured loans may involve renegotiated interest rates  repayment terms  or both  because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower 
the only credits that would have qualified as restructured loans at the end of both years were already classified in the more severe non accrual category 
the following table provides a comparative summary of nonperforming assets and total risk elements at the end of each of the last five years in thousands 
loans on which accrual of interest has been discontinued commercial  financial and agricultural      mortgages      other  loans renegotiated with borrowers total non accrual loans      foreclosed real estate   total non performing assets      loans past due days or more commercial  financial and agricultural  mortgages consumer and other total risk elements      ending allowance for loan losses      ending allowance to non accrual loans despite improvement in most categories of problem credits  there was a substantial increase in foreclosed real estate from to the balance in this category grew from million at december  to million at the end of nearly all of the increase was related to the reclassification of two large credits that had been made to a single borrower 
pursuant to the provisions of the original loan agreements  community took possession of two collateral properties in the fourth quarter of  due to borrower default 
a new  unrelated borrower purchased one of the properties in january   resulting in the return of nearly million of loans to accrual status 
amounts included in foreclosed real estate are stated at the lower of cost or market and no losses are expected from the final disposition of these properties 
the determination to discontinue the accrual of interest on non performing loans is made on the individual case basis 
such factors as the character and size of the loan  quality of the collateral and the historical creditworthiness of the borrower and or guarantors are considered by management in assessing the collectibility of such amounts 
the approximate amount that would have been accrued on those loans for which interest was discontinued in was  overall assessment community has assessed all of the above factors in the establishment of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination as to the adequacy of the allowance reflects management s judgment  and was based upon collateral  local market conditions  various estimates  and other information that requires subjective analysis 
these factors  which are prone to change  are monitored by management to evaluate their potential impact on management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance 
based on its evaluation of loan quality  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate to absorb probable losses within the loan portfolio 
deposits deposit balances remain the primary source of funding for financial institutions and community recognized steady growth of nearly in this important core funding source  summarized as follows in thousands change amount demand    savings now accounts    time   time  or more    deposit growth in occurred almost exclusively in savings deposits  more specifically community s power now account 
this account  which has characteristics of both a money market and checking account  grew steadily throughout the year 
at the same time  longer term time deposit growth was flat 
consumer preferences were clearly weighted in favor of maintaining adequate liquidity in anticipation of a gradual rise in rates 
despite the fact that most interest rates declined steadily throughout the period  most depositors were reluctant to extend time deposit maturities to obtain only marginally higher rates 
the consistent downward pressure on rates  combined with lack of confidence in other more risky investment vehicles  increased consumer preference for the flexibility  liquidity and guaranteed return provided by these accounts 
the following table summarizes the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more as of december  in thousands 
remaining to maturity less than three months  three months to six months  six months to twelve months  more than twelve months  borrowed funds community makes tactical use of federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other borrowed funds to augment its funding needs 
strategic capital leverage efforts  including share repurchase and various investment initiatives  have affected the volume and composition of non deposit funding 
the largest component of borrowed funds comes from fhlb advances 
fhlb borrowings  which are collateralized by residential mortgages or other qualified securities  include a variety of credit products available to community through its membership in the federal home loan bank 
capital adequacy capital strength is an important measure with which to judge the overall stability of a financial institution 
a strong capital base is a prerequisite for sustaining franchise growth through both internal expansion and strategic acquisition opportunities 
regulatory authorities impose constraints and restrictions on bank capital levels that are designed to help ensure the vitality of the nation s banking system 
community believes that capital is a valuable  albeit limited resource whose availability moderates with changes in the business cycle 
the corporation has developed an extensive capital management policy designed to consider all aspects of capital management 
this policy is mindful of the responsibilities to community s shareholders  employees  regulators  and other constituencies to ensure that capital is well managed 
the policy considers the impact of numerous capital management issues  including the maintenance of key financial ratios  the need for an adequate return to shareholders in terms of both dividend payout and capital appreciation  the flexibility to apply techniques that will accommodate either equity expansion or contraction  and the restraint required to avoid accumulation of unsustainable levels of intangible assets 
community also continuously examines its options with regard to capital management in the context of intrinsic factors  including its prospects for growth  the potential for earnings disruption  and others 
maintenance of appropriate capital levels may require the application of techniques designed to help community meet or exceed regulatory guidelines and to correlate capital levels with a given asset growth rate 
the corporation s capital management and planning process is reviewed and approved by its board of directors 
in addition to internal guidelines  regulators have established standards for the monitoring and maintenance of appropriate levels of capital for financial institutions 
all regulatory capital guidelines are now based upon a risk based supervisory approach that has been designed to ensure effective management of capital levels and associated business risk 
the following table provides the risk based capital positions of community and its principal banking subsidiary at the end of  along with an indication of the various regulatory capital requirements 
december  well regulatory capitalized minimums leverage ratio community banks  inc n a bank only tier capital ratio community banks  inc n a bank only total risk based capital ratio community banks  inc n a bank only the most fundamental source of capital is earnings and earnings retention 
this cornerstone of capital adequacy can be augmented by a number of capital management strategies  many of which were utilized during as it has for a number of years  the board approved the issuance of a stock dividend in the first quarter 
in the fourth quarter  the board announced the approval of a stock split issued in the form of a stock dividend  which has been accounted for on a pro forma basis throughout this presentation 
throughout the year  the corporation s strong earnings supported a return of capital to existing shareholders in the form of an increase in the traditional cash dividend 
community also continues to make strategic use of share repurchase as another efficient means of returning capital to shareholders 
in december of  management executed another pooled trust preferred issuance of million in order to increase the amount of qualifying regulatory capital through this relatively inexpensive funding source 
community previously had executed a million issuance at the end of  bringing the total trust preferred balances to million at december  such amounts are classified as long term debt for financial statement purposes 
it is anticipated that additional regulatory guidance is forthcoming regarding the suitability of trust preferred issuances as tier capital on a going forward basis 
community places no significant reliance on these instruments to meet regulatory capital requirements and anticipates no material change in its accounting as a consequence of this new guidance 
in the aggregate  these various strategies and techniques have allowed management to maintain capital at levels that represented an efficient use of this valuable resource 
asset liability management and liquidity the process by which financial institutions manage earning assets and funding sources under different interest rate environments is called asset liability management 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to increase net interest income through the prudent control of market risk  liquidity  interest rate risk and capital 
two important barometers of performance are net interest margin and liquidity 
net interest margin is increased by widening interest spread while controlling interest rate sensitivity 
the adequacy of liquidity is determined by the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of both depositors and customers requesting bank credit 
the board of directors the board and the audit committee of the board governs and monitors asset liability management processes as part of the overall risk management process and delegates the responsibility for management of these processes to the corporate asset liability management committee alco 
liquidity is defined as the ability to meet maturing obligations and customers demand for funds on a continuous basis 
liquidity is sustained by stable core deposits  a diversified mix of liabilities  strong credit perception and the presence of sufficient assets convertible to cash without material loss or disruption of normal operations 
community actively manages liquidity within a defined range and has developed reasonable liquidity contingency plans  ensuring availability of alternate funding sources to maintain adequate liquidity under a variety of business conditions 
the corporation s investing and financing activities are conducted within the overall constraints of its liquidity management policy and practices 
community utilizes a variety of techniques to assist management and the board of directors in the management and monitoring of interest rate risk 
in order to quantify the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  the corporation conducts a quarterly interest rate shock simulation that projects the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income over the next year 
these simulations are utilized to assess whether management should consider corrective actions in order to minimize community s exposure or vulnerability to a particular trend in interest rates 
management has established acceptable tolerance limits for the impact of changes in interest rates on the volatility of net interest income  and is authorized to pursue mitigating strategies in order to minimize unfavorable impact under a variety of scenarios 
such simulations are conducted under a variety of assumptions that require estimates of the velocity and extent of interest rate changes  including an assessment of the impact of such changes on those assets and liabilities that have indeterminate maturity or repricing characteristics 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure community s earning exposure for the ensuing year 
current policy limits unfavorable exposure of simulated net interest income to of the base case net interest income in either a rising or falling rate shock scenario immediate repricing of basis points 
the following is a summary of the rate shock results conducted under these various assumptions as december  annual simultaneous change rate in net interest shock income change bp million bp million bp million bp million management augments its simulation process with two other techniques  gap analysis and economic value of equity eve computations 
the most practical tool for day to day management of interest rate risk is gap analysis  which provides an array of various timeframes during which earning assets and funding sources can be expected to mature or reprice 
this information is ordinarily examined in the context of the results derived from the quarterly rate shock simulations 
management uses such information to identify specific cause and effect relationships that can be reviewed  analyzed  managed  or changed to ensure maximization of net revenue from intermediation activities 
the combination of gap analysis and rate shock simulations provides the most practical measurement tools for monitoring and managing of the largest source of revenue for community banks 
as with the simulation or shock analysis  community has established a policy limit for the cumulative twelve month gap of plus or minus of total assets 
at december   the twelve month gap fell well within this policy limit for each of the time intervals less than one year  as shown in the following summary cumulative gap interval expressed as of assets days days days eve computations provide a longer term assessment of interest rate risk  but are more practical for evaluating long term  strategic planning alternatives 
eve has several limitations  including the intrinsic value of assets and liabilities does not necessarily represent the fair value of financial instruments since it does not include credit risk and liquidity  estimated cash flows are required for nonmaturity financial instruments and are  by their nature  inexact and  the future structure of community s balance sheet does not consider increased loan and deposit activities from core business within its present value assessment 
the results derived from eve computations  however  provide a valuable framework for managing longer term balance sheet exposures and interest rate volatility trends 
at the end of  all measures of eve fell within the policy limits established via the asset liability management policy  as approved by the board of directors 
contractual obligations significant contractual obligations at december  are summarized in the following table less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years long term debt      operating lease obligations      trust preferred securities   time deposits      defined benefit pension payments total      off balance sheet commitments as of december   the corporation had unfunded commitments totaling million 
for details of these off balance sheet commitments  see notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies included in part ii  item regulatory matters community and its affiliates are subject to periodic examinations by the various regulatory agencies 
these examinations include  but are not limited to  procedures designed to review lending practices  risk management  credit quality  liquidity  compliance and capital adequacy 
during  the pennsylvania state department of banking  the federal deposit insurance corporation  and the federal reserve bank performed various examinations of community and its banking subsidiaries pursuant to their regular  periodic regulatory reviews 
no comments were received from these various bodies that would have a material adverse effect on community s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
inflation community s ability to cope with the impact of inflation is best measured by its ability to respond to changing interest rates and manage non interest income and expense 
within its alco processes  the corporation manages the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to limit the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
inflation also has a direct impact on non interest income and expense such as service fee income  salary and benefits expenses  and other overhead expenses 
inflationary pressures over the last several years have been modest but this trend is subject to change 
management will continue to monitor the potential for inflation and its impact on the pricing of products and services 
performance review vs 
against a backdrop of an uncertain economy  increasing global tensions  a series of unfortunate corporate scandals  and the lowest interest rate environment in the last four decades  community banks  inc recorded substantial performance improvement in net income reached million and earnings per share grew to  reflecting an increase of and  respectively  over the results achieved in performance in had been reduced by charges incurred in connection with the merger of glen rock state bank  which was combined into community banks at the end of the first quarter of results for translated into a roa of and a roe of  and represented a substantial improvement over the roa of and roe of reported in performance in represented a realization of community s strategic efforts to provide its customers with expanded financial services within the framework of a convenient and efficient community banking model 
interest income interest income was million in  virtually equal to the million recorded in  despite the fact that earning asset yields declined from to over the two year period 
at the same time  earning assets grew  from nearly billion to billion  and helped to offset the compression that would normally accompany lower earning asset yields 
from to  earning assets grew million  including million in loans and million in portfolio investment securities 
this reflected growth rates of in loans and in investments 
during  community experienced growth in total deposits  which increased by nearly million  and clearly outpaced the level of demand for increased credit facilities 
this excess funding was then utilized to fund increases in the level of portfolio investments throughout the year 
community seeks to maintain an investment portfolio that both maximizes return and provides an additional source of liquidity as demand for more profitable loan relationships increases 
interest expense interest expense on deposits and other funding sources declined dramatically during and was the primary driver of the improvement in net interest income 
while interest income was stable during  community achieved an reduction in interest expense  even as total deposits increased and total interest bearing liabilities grew 
total interest expense dropped to million  a decline of million  representing substantial improvement from the interest expense of million recorded in deposits grew by million  which included growth of million in core transaction and saving accounts and million in time deposits 
growth in deposit funding was attributable to a number of factors  including the safety  soundness and convenience of bank deposit products as contrasted with the volatility and risk of loss that has characterized other investment and savings alternatives over the last several years 
community also grew its funding from long term debt  which consists primarily of collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank  by almost million  or to selectively augment growth in the deposit categories 
throughout  the steady decline in prevailing interest rates allowed community to reduce pricing on time deposits 
in the fourth quarter of the year  most banks were forced to reexamine the pricing on more core sources of funds as rates declined to the lowest levels in decades 
as a consequence of these trends  the overall cost of funds declined basis points  from in to in net interest income net interest income reached million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
virtually all of the improvement was related to the decline in the cost of funding  which declined by million 
this improvement was achieved despite a drop in net interest margin from in to in as in  community benefited from increases in the absolute volume of earning assets and from its ability to lower funding costs in declining rate environment 
provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses declined from million in to million in  while the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans also reflected a modest decline from at the end of to at the end of when comparing asset quality trends from to those during  community reported significant improvements in the metrics commonly used to assess the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio 
non interest income income from non interest sources grew to million from in  an increase of nearly 
results in included over thousand in gains from the sale of two branches  but improvement in year over year performance still would have reached  exclusive of these gains 
community experienced growth in almost all categories of non interest income 
income from the commissions earned on sales of mutual funds and annuity products grew as was the first full year  bank wide rollout of these product offerings 
the increase of in deposit service charges was driven by both the increase in the volume of personal and business accounts and by the continuous evaluation of the fee structure to ensure that community is fairly compensated for the cost of providing these deposit services 
other service charges  commissions and fees reflect revenues received from customers who utilize the various cash exchange and payment systems that are accessible through community s bank network  and grew 
insurance fees were increased by the fees from the first full year of operation of the sentinel agency 
on the credit insurance side  community actually experienced a reduction in the fees earned through its captive insurance business  which partially offset the increase in title insurance fees 
revenues from mortgage origination activities were strong in both and due to the favorable effect of low interest rates on both purchase mortgages and refinancings 
non interest expenses non interest expenses grew to million in versus in  resulting in an increase of million in year over year expenses 
expenses in had included nearly million in nonrecurring expenses incurred in connection with the merger of glen rock state bank at the end of the first quarter of excluding these charges  non interest expenses grew nearly million and reflected an increase in core operating expenses of 
the vast majority of the increase in recurring expenses occurred in salary and benefits expense  which grew from million in to million in  an increase of 
of the total increase from to  nearly was attributed to the average salary increase of 
an additional was ascribed to increases in the corporation s discretionary variable compensation plans  employee benefit plan contributions  sales incentives and other performance driven compensation plans 
the impact of annual merit increase combined with performance driven compensation accounted for almost one half of the increase in salary and benefit costs 
the remaining of the total increase in salary and benefit expenses was driven by several factors  including the following the full year impact of staffing of offices added in along with the partial year impact of those added in  the increase in personnel added in nontraditional banking services  most notably those added from the merger of the sentinel agency  and the increased cost of providing group insurance benefits to employees 
occupancy expenses increased thousand and  like salary and benefit expenses  were influenced by offices added in both and other expense exhibited a more modest increase from to during  community had incurred incremental costs associated with new branch openings  the acquisition of glen rock state bank and the convergence of bank charters

the purpose of this presentation is to augment the discussion contained in the md a 
market risk is defined as the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments pursuant to factors arising out of the various categories of market risk 
market risk can include a number of categories  including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  etc 
for domestic  community based banks  the vast majority of market risk is related to interest rate risk 
financial institutions use a number of techniques to attempt to measure the impact of interest rate risk which includes gap analysis  interest rate shock simulation and economic value of equity 
each of these techniques is used to help quantify market risk attributable to the inherent sensitivity of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  creating a risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  the corporation s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the corporation s exposure to interest rate sensitivity is managed primarily through the corporation s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
since the corporation s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  its ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences in the market areas in which it operates 
borrowings  which include federal home loan bank fhlb advances and short term loans  subordinated notes  and other short term and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate the corporation s exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of the corporation s interest earning assets result primarily from its strategy of investing in loans and securities a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms which permit the corporation to limit its exposure to interest rate sensitivity  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread compared to the cost of interest bearing liabilities

community seeks to maximize net interest income and minimize earnings volatility by managing the level of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is influenced by the repricing characteristic of both assets and liabilities and includes the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of repricing and the relative magnitude of the repricing 
while gap measurement provides an important tool to quantify the level of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time  its utility is constrained by the inherent limitations of gap measurement for a number of reasons 
first  changes in the level of interest rates cannot be expected to affect all assets and liabilities equally nor will they all be impacted at the same time 
second  assets and liabilities that are eligible to be repriced within a specific time frame may  in fact  not reprice or may not reprice to the same extent 
third  the measurement of gap is inherently limited in that it provides a representation of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities at a specific point in time while actual sensitivity of assets and liabilities are undergoing constant change 
finally  much of the presentation of gap is  by necessity  based upon estimates and assumptions for certain assets and liabilities 
for example  savings  now accounts  and other forms of core deposits do not have defined maturities or repricing dates and therefore require estimates to be made based upon historical deposit decay rate analysis or other forms of approximation 
interest rate sensitivity  and the measurement thereof  are also influenced by the optionality of certain earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for example  a substantial portion of the corporation s loans and mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans contain significant embedded options  which permit the borrower to prepay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate and interest rate index if any of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit to be obtained from refinancing  availability of refinancing at attractive terms  as well as economic and other factors in specific geographic areas which affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease on fixed and adjustable rate loans pursuant to the current relative levels and expectations of future short and long term interest rates 
investment securities  other than mortgage backed securities and those with early call provisions generally do not have significant embedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with such customers is generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterrupted source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment by the corporation of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
in addition to periodic gap reports comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  management also utilizes a report which measures the exposure of the corporation s economic value of equity to interest rate risk 
the model calculates the present value of assets  liabilities and equity at current interest rates  and at hypothetically higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the present value of each major category of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on prepayments  early withdrawals  weighted average contractual rates and terms  and discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the resulting present value of longer term fixed rate financial instruments are more sensitive to change in a higher or lower interest rate scenario  while adjustable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in present value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next interest rate repricing date 
the information provided by these analyses provides some indication of the potential for interest rate adjustment  but does not necessarily mean that the rate adjustment will occur or that it will occur in accordance with the assumptions 
despite these inherent limitations  community believes that the tools used to manage its level of interest rate risk provide an appropriate measure of market risk exposure 
the following table reflects the estimated present value of assets  liabilities and equity using the model for community as of december  at current interest rates and hypothetically  higher and lower interest rates of one and two percent
