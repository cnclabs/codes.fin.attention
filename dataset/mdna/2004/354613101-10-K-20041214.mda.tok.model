item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements in this section  we discuss our results of operations and our financial condition 
in addition to historical information  we also make some statements relating to the future  which are called forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve a number of risks  uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
for this reason  you should not rely too heavily on them and should review the risk factors section  where we discuss these statements in more detail 
general we derive the majority of our operating revenues  operating expenses and net income from providing investment advisory and related services to retail mutual funds  institutional accounts  high net worth clients  private accounts and other investment products 
this is our primary business activity and operating segment 
the mutual funds and other products that we advise  collectively called our sponsored investment products  are distributed to the public globally under six distinct names franklin templeton mutual series bissett fiduciary trust darby overseas our sponsored investment products include a broad range of global international equity  us domestic  hybrid  fixed income and money market mutual funds  as well as other investment products that meet a wide variety of specific investment needs of individuals and institutions 
the level of our revenues depends largely on the level and relative mix of assets under management 
to a lesser degree  our revenues also depend on the level of mutual fund sales and the number of mutual fund shareholder accounts 
the fees charged for our services are based on contracts with our sponsored investment products or our clients 
these arrangements could change in the future 
our secondary business and operating segment is banking finance 
our banking finance group offers selected retail banking services to high net worth individuals  foundations and institutions  and consumer lending services 
our consumer lending activities include automotive lending related to the purchase  securitization  and servicing of retail installment sales contracts originated by independent automobile dealerships  consumer credit and debit cards  real estate equity lines  and home equity mortgage loans 
executive summary fiscal was challenging for the mutual fund industry as various regulatory bodies continued their investigations of certain industry practices 
we are working with a number of government regulators who are looking into matters involving frequent trading commonly referred to as market timing policies and practices  marketing support payments to securities broker dealers who sell fund shares  and other industry concerns 
despite the scrutiny  key performance measures continued to improve in fiscal our diluted earnings per share grew to in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our operating margin increased to in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal market appreciation and excess sales over redemptions increased our assets under management to an all time record of billion at september   as compared to billion at september  and billion at september  our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management was in fiscal  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal as our client base broadens geographically  we remain attentive to the specialized needs of these clients and continue to expand the investment choices available to them 
to that end  on october   we completed the acquisition of darby overseas investments  ltd 
and darby overseas partners  lp collectively darby  a group specializing in private equity  mezzanine and emerging markets fixed income products 
in fiscal  we acquired pioneer iti amc limited pioneer  an indian investment management company 
results of operations the table below presents the highlights of our operations for the last three fiscal years 
in millions except per share amounts for the years ended september  vs vs net income earnings per common share basic diluted operating margin net income increased by and diluted earnings per share increased by in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues consistent with a increase in our simple monthly average assets under management  higher gross sales on which commissions are earned  and an increase in billable shareholder accounts 
these increases were partially offset by higher underwriting and distribution expenses  higher compensation and benefits expense  the provision for governmental investigations  proceedings and actions and a higher effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
the decline in diluted weighted average shares outstanding from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  also contributed to the increase in diluted earnings per common share 
the decrease in diluted weighted average shares outstanding resulted from stock repurchases  especially in the latter half of fiscal  partially offset by an increase in dilution from the assumed conversion of stock options granted as the price of our common stock increased during fiscal net income increased by and diluted earnings per share increased by in fiscal primarily due to higher operating revenues consistent with a increase in our simple monthly average assets under management  as well as higher investment and other income in fiscal due to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments in fiscal assets under management in billions as of the years ended september  vs vs equity global international domestic us total equity hybrid fixed income tax free taxable domestic us global international total fixed income money market total simple monthly average for the year investment management fees from approximately of our assets under management at september  were calculated using daily average assets under management 
our assets under management at september  were billion  higher than they were a year ago  due to excess sales over redemptions of billion and market appreciation of billion  primarily in the first half of fiscal simple monthly average assets under management  which are generally more indicative of investment management fee revenue trends than the year over year change in ending assets under management  increased during fiscal the simple monthly average mix of assets under management for the last three fiscal years is shown below 
for the years ended september  percentage of simple monthly average assets under management equity fixed income hybrid money market total the following table presents industry data showing average effective investment management fee rates for the years ended september    and the data was obtained from lipper r inc and our actual effective fee rates may vary from these rates

the averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels  without exception 
variable annuity products are not included 
for the fiscal year  our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by simple monthly average assets under management increased to from in fiscal the change in the mix of assets under management  resulting from higher excess sales over redemptions and appreciation for equity as compared to fixed income products  led to the increase in the effective investment management fee rate 
generally  equity products carry higher management fees than fixed income products 
for the fiscal year  our effective investment management fee rate declined to from in fiscal the change in the mix of assets under management  resulting from higher relative excess sales over redemptions and appreciation for fixed income as compared to equity products  led to the slight decrease in the effective investment management fee rate 
assets under management by sales office location were as follows in billions as of the years ended september  of total of total united states canada europe asia pacific and other total includes multi jurisdictional assets under management 
approximately of our assets under management at september  originated from our us sales offices and approximately of our revenues originated in the united states in fiscal due to the global nature of our business operations  investment advisory and administrative services may be performed in locations unrelated to the location of the shareholder 
components of the change in our assets under management were as follows in billions as of and for the years ended september  vs vs beginning assets under management sales reinvested dividends redemptions distributions acquisitions n a appreciation depreciation n a ending assets under management excess sales over redemptions were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal gross product sales increased while redemptions increased in darby added billion in assets under management  related to private equity  mezzanine and emerging markets fixed income products as of the acquisition date  on october  our acquisition of pioneer  in july  increased our assets under management by billion as of the date of this acquisition 
our products experienced billion in appreciation in fiscal  as compared to billion in fiscal and market depreciation of billion in fiscal operating revenues the table below presents the percentage change in each revenue category between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal percentage of total revenues vs vs investment management fees underwriting and distribution fees shareholder servicing fees consolidated sponsored investment products income  net  n a other  net total operating revenues investment management fees investment management fees  accounting for of our operating revenues in fiscal  include both investment advisory and administration fees 
these fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products as a percentage of the market value of assets under management 
annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided 
in return for these fees  we provide a combination of investment advisory  administrative and other management services 
investment management fees increased in fiscal consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and an increase in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in average asset mix toward equity products  which generally carry a higher management fee than fixed income assets 
investment management fees increased in fiscal consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management  partially offset by a slight decline in our effective investment management fee rate resulting from a shift in average asset mix toward fixed income products 
underwriting and distribution fees we earn underwriting fees from the sale of some classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales commission at the time of purchase 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some classes of shares and for sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum amounts 
therefore  underwriting fees will change with the overall level of gross sales and the relative mix of sales between different share classes 
many of our sponsored investment products pay distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
while other contractual arrangements exist in international jurisdictions  in the united states  distribution fees include b fees 
these fees are subject to maximum payout levels based on a percentage of the assets in each fund and other regulatory limitations 
we pay a significant portion of underwriting and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf 
see the description of underwriting and distribution expenses below 
overall  underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal underwriting fees increased primarily due to a increase in gross product sales along with a change in the sales mix 
distribution fees increased consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset and share class mix 
underwriting and distribution fees increased in fiscal underwriting fees increased primarily due to a increase in gross product sales  partially offset by a change in the sales mix 
distribution fees increased consistent with a increase in simple monthly average assets under management and a change in the asset and share class mix 
shareholder servicing fees shareholder servicing fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some instances  sponsored investment products are charged these fees based on the level of assets under management 
we receive fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  including providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service and tax reporting 
in the united states  transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year remain billable through the second quarter of the following calendar year at a reduced rate 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the growth in new accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal the increase reflects an increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts  primarily due to the overall increase in number of shareholder accounts billable under revised shareholder service fee agreements in the united states that became effective on january   partially offset by a decline in fee rates chargeable on accounts closed in the prior calendar year  under these agreements 
shareholder servicing fees increased in fiscal the increase reflects an increase in the overall number of billable shareholder accounts  partially offset by a decline in fee rates chargeable on accounts closed in the prior calendar year  under revised shareholder service fee agreements in the united states that became effective on january  the million shareholder accounts added in july as a result of the acquisition of pioneer also contributed to the increase in average billable accounts in fiscal consolidated sponsored investment products income  net consolidated sponsored investment products income  net reflects the net operating income of majority owned sponsored investment products  including dividends received 
the increase in fiscal reflects an increase in the number of products that have been consolidated in our results of operations 
other  net other  net consists primarily of revenues from the banking finance operating segment as well as income from custody services 
revenues from the banking finance operating segment include interest income on loans  servicing income  and investment income on banking finance investment securities  and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for probable loan losses 
other  net decreased in fiscal due to lower realized gains on sale of automotive loans and decreased interest income on investments  partially offset by a decrease in the provision for probable loan losses related to our consumer lending portfolio and lower interest expense 
other  net increased in fiscal as a result of higher net interest income and auto loan servicing income  partially offset by lower custody fees 
operating expenses the table below presents the percentage change in each expense category between fiscal and fiscal and between fiscal and fiscal percentage of total expenses vs vs underwriting and distribution compensation and benefits information systems  technology and occupancy advertising and promotion amortization of deferred sales commissions amortization of intangible assets provision for mutual fund proceedings  actions and investigations n a n a n a n a september  recovery expense  net n a n a other total operating expenses underwriting and distribution underwriting and distribution includes expenses paid to financial advisers and other third parties for selling  distributing and providing ongoing services to investors in our sponsored investment products 
underwriting and distribution expenses increased in fiscal and in fiscal consistent with similar trends in underwriting and distribution revenues 
compensation and benefits compensation and benefits increased during fiscal the increase resulted primarily from an increase in bonus expense under the amended and restated annual incentive compensation plan  which awards cash and stock bonuses based  in part  on our performance 
in addition  merit salary increases effective in october and additional compensation and benefit costs related to the acquisition of darby in october increased costs in fiscal the increase was partly reduced by the decline of retention bonus commitments related to the acquisition of fiduciary trust company international fiduciary trust in april  as we fulfilled cash payout obligations under the employee retention and transition compensation program that were required to be paid within approximately two years of the acquisition date 
we employed approximately  people at september  as compared to about  at september  in order to attract and retain talented individuals  we are committed to keeping our salaries and benefit packages competitive  which means that the level of compensation and benefits may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenues 
compensation and benefits increased during fiscal although we experienced a decrease in retention bonus commitments related to the acquisition of fiduciary trust  we also experienced increases in employee insurance and other benefits costs in fiscal we employed approximately  people at september  compared to approximately  at september  information systems  technology and occupancy information systems  technology and occupancy costs decreased in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation levels for equipment and software related to a decrease in purchases of information system and technology equipment as certain of our technology equipment is periodically replaced with new equipment under our technology outsourcing agreement  as well as a stabilization in the number and the scope of new technology project initiatives 
the decline in information systems and technology expense was partly offset by an increase in outside data services as well as an increase in building depreciation related to the consolidation of our headquarters campus in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised december fin r in our results of operation effective december  and subsequent purchase of the property in september information systems  technology and occupancy costs decreased in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation levels for equipment and software 
details of capitalized information systems and technology costs for the last three fiscal years were as follows in millions net carrying amount at beginning of period additions during period  net of disposals and other adjustments net assets purchased through acquisitions amortization during period net carrying amount at end of period advertising and promotion advertising and promotion increased during fiscal and decreased in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to the elimination of directed brokerage effective november  and higher expenditures on direct advertising campaigns and marketing materials 
we are committed to investing in advertising and promotion in response to changing business conditions  which means that the level of advertising and promotion expenditures may increase more rapidly or decrease more slowly than our revenues 
amortization of deferred sales commissions certain fund share classes  including class b  are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders  although our distribution subsidiaries pay a commission on the sale 
in the united states  class a shares are sold without a front end sales charge to shareholders when minimum investment criteria are met  and class c shares are sold without a front end sales charge effective january  however  our us distribution subsidiary pays a commission on these sales 
we defer and amortize all up front commissions paid by our distribution subsidiaries in excess of commissions we receive from shareholders  over months to years depending on share class or financing arrangements 
we have arranged to finance our class b and certain of our class c deferred commission assets dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations through lightning finance company limited lfl  a company in which we have a ownership interest 
in the united states  lfl has entered into a financing agreement with our us distribution subsidiary and we maintain a continuing interest in the assets until resold by lfl 
as a result  we retain dca sold to lfl under the us agreement in our financial statements and amortize them over an year period  or until sold by lfl to third parties 
in contrast to the us arrangement  lfl has entered into direct agreements with our canadian and european sponsored investment products  and  as a result  we do not record dca from these sources on our consolidated balance sheets 
the boards of the funds that offer class b shares have approved a proposal to cease the offering of class b shares to new investors and existing shareholders desiring to make additional purchases 
existing class b shareholders would continue to be permitted to exchange shares into class b shares of different funds 
existing class b shareholders would also be permitted to continue to reinvest dividends in additional class b shares 
the cessation of purchases of class b shares by new investors and existing shareholders will be effective in the first calendar quarter of and may have a negative effect on the overall sales of the funds shares 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal from the prior year primarily due to increased gross product sales 
amortization of deferred sales commissions increased in fiscal from the prior year primarily due to increased gross product sales and because lfl did not sell any us dca in a securitization transaction in fiscal  while it sold approximately million us dca in fiscal amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased in fiscal and decreased in fiscal  primarily due to foreign currency movements in intangible assets not denominated in us dollars 
as of march   we completed our most recent annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets  and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of october  provision for governmental investigations  proceedings and actions in fiscal  we recognized charges to income aggregating to million million  net of taxes related to ongoing governmental investigations  proceedings and actions 
see also risk factors below 
september  recovery  net in january  we received million from our insurance carrier for claims related to the september  terrorist attacks that destroyed fiduciary trust s headquarters 
these proceeds represented final recoveries for claims submitted to our insurance carrier 
we realized a gain of million million  net of taxes 
all remaining contingencies related to our insurance claims have been resolved 
other income expenses other income expenses includes net realized and unrealized investment gains losses of consolidated sponsored investment products  investment and other income  and interest expense 
investment and other income is comprised primarily of dividends  interest income and realized gains and losses from investments  income from investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting  minority interest expense  and foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
net other income increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal due to higher net investment gains related to consolidated sponsored investment products and higher dividends  interest  net realized gains and equity method income from our investments 
the increase was partially offset by higher interest expense related to the issuance of five year senior notes in april and minority interest expense related to the consolidated sponsored investment products 
net other income was million in fiscal as compared to a net expense of million in fiscal due to a million other than temporary decline in value of some of our investments recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal taxes on income as a multi national corporation  we provide investment management services to a wide range of international investment products  often managed from locations outside the united states 
some of these jurisdictions have lower tax rates than the united states 
the mix of pre tax income primarily from our investment management business subject to these lower rates  when aggregated with income originating in the united states  produces a lower overall effective tax rate than existing us federal and state tax rates 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal increased to compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the effective tax rate will continue to reflect the relative contributions of foreign earnings that are subject to reduced tax rates and that are not currently included in us taxable income  as well as other factors 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity  and sources and uses of capital in millions as of and for the years ended september  balance sheet data assets liquid assets    cash and cash equivalents   liabilities commercial paper convertible notes medium term notes other long term debt total debt   cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows liquid assets  which consist of cash and cash equivalents  investments trading and available for sale and current receivables  increased from fiscal  primarily due to cash provided by operating activities 
cash and cash equivalents include cash  debt instruments with maturities of three months or less at the purchase date and other highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash  including money market funds 
cash and cash equivalents increased in fiscal as we held a larger portion of liquid assets in debt instruments  primarily term deposits  with maturities of three months or less from the purchase date  resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in investment securities  available for sale 
the increase in total debt outstanding from september  relates to million of commercial paper issued in september to purchase the assets of a lessor trust that held our corporate headquarter campus 
the lessor trust had previously been consolidated in our financial statements in december in accordance with the guidance of fin r 
in addition  other long term debt increased as our long term financing liability recognized in relation to us dca financed by lfl  has increased in fiscal  as lfl has not sold any us dca in a securitization transaction since fiscal the increase in operating cash flows in fiscal included million in net income and million in proceeds from the securitization of loans held for sale  net of originations 
the increase in investing cash flows in fiscal related primarily to excess liquidations of investments over purchases of  million 
financing activities in fiscal included the issuance of million of commercial paper and million in common stock option exercises 
in addition  during the year ended september   we purchased and retired million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
at september   approximately million shares remained available for repurchase under board authorizations 
we purchased and retired million shares at a cost of million  and million shares at a cost of million in the years ended september  and capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations  borrowing capacity under current credit facilities  the ability to issue debt or equity securities  and mutual fund sales commission financing arrangements 
in particular  we expect to finance future investment in our banking finance activities through operating cash flows  debt  increased deposit base  and through the securitization of a portion of the receivables from consumer lending activities 
as of september   we had million of debt and equity securities available to be issued under shelf registration statements filed with the sec and million of additional commercial paper available for issuance 
our committed revolving credit facilities at september  totaled million  of which  million was under a day facility expiring in june the remaining million facility is under a five year facility that will expire in june in addition  at september   our banking finance operating segment had million in available uncommitted short term bank lines under the federal reserve funds system  the federal reserve bank discount window  and federal home loan bank short term borrowing capacity 
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
in extreme circumstances  we might not be able to access this liquidity readily 
our investment management segment finances class b and certain class c dca arising from our us  canadian and european operations through lfl  a company in which we have a ownership interest 
class b and c sales commissions that we have financed globally through lfl during fiscal  were approximately million compared to million in fiscal lfl s ability to access credit facilities and the securitization market will directly affect our existing financing arrangements 
our banking finance operating segment finances its automotive lending activities through operational cash flows  inter segment loans and by selling its auto loans in securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors 
beginning in fiscal  automotive lending activities may also be financed by issuing auto loan backed variable funding notes to institutional investors  and as a result  we expect that inter segment lending activities may decrease 
gross sale proceeds from auto loan securitization transactions were million in fiscal and million in fiscal our ability to access the securitization market will directly affect our plans to finance the auto loan portfolio in the future 
uses of capital we expect that the main uses of cash will be to expand our core business  make strategic acquisitions  acquire shares of our common stock  fund property and equipment purchases  pay operating expenses of the business  enhance technology infrastructure and business processes  pay shareholder dividends and repay and service debt 
in may  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon convertible senior notes due the convertible notes 
the convertible notes  which were offered to qualified institutional buyers only  carry an interest rate of per annum  with an initial conversion premium of 
each of the  principal amount at maturity convertible notes is convertible into shares of our common stock  when the price of our stock reaches certain thresholds 
to date  we have repurchased convertible notes with a face value of million principal amount at maturity  for their accreted value of million  in cash 
we may redeem the remaining convertible notes for cash on or after may  or make additional repurchases  at the option of the holders  on may of    and in this event  we may choose to pay the accreted value of the convertible notes in cash or shares of our common stock 
the amount that the holders may redeem in the future will depend on  among other factors  the performance of our common stock 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments as of september  we believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments thorough existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities 
in millions payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations and commitments total year years years years non current debt  operating leases purchase obligations loan origination commitments defined benefit plan obligation capital contribution commitments total  operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements totaling million as of september purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be cancelled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees 
in particular  under an agreement to outsource management of our data center and distributed server operations that we can terminate any time after july   we estimate that the termination fee payable in july  not including costs associated with assuming equipment leases  would approximate million and would decrease each month for the subsequent two years  reaching a payment of approximately million in july defined benefit plan obligation relates to our expected contribution to a noncontributory retirement plan and a nonqualified supplemental plan that will be made when the final approval of the noncontributory retirement plan termination is received from the internal revenue service 
capital contribution commitments relate to our contractual commitments to fund certain of our sponsored investment products 
contingent obligations in relation to the auto loan securitization transactions that we have entered into with a number of qualified special purpose entities  we are obligated to cover shortfalls in amounts due to the holders of the notes up to certain levels as specified under the related agreements 
as of september   the maximum potential amount of future payments was million relating to guarantees made prior to january  in addition  our consolidated balance sheet at september  included a million liability to reflect obligations arising from auto securitization transactions subsequent to december  at september   the banking finance operating segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers  primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers 
these standby letters of credit  issued prior to january   were secured by marketable securities with a fair value of million as of september  and commercial real estate 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed above  we obtain financing for sales commissions that we pay to broker dealers on class b and certain class c shares through lfl  a company established in ireland to provide dca financing 
we hold a ownership interest in lfl and we account for this ownership interest using the equity method of accounting 
our exposure to loss related to our investment in lfl is limited to the carrying value of our investment and loans  and interest and fees receivable from lfl 
at september   those amounts approximated million 
during fiscal  we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately million for our share of its net loss over this period 
as discussed above  our banking finance operating segment periodically enters into auto loan securitization transactions with qualified special purpose entities  which then issue asset backed securities to private investors 
our main objective in entering in securitization transactions is to obtain financing for auto loan activities 
securitized loans held by the securitization trusts totaled million at september  and million at september  critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our financial position and results of operations 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
goodwill and other intangible assets at september  our assets included intangible assets as follows in millions net carrying amount goodwill  intangible assets definite lived intangible assets indefinite lived total  we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangibles in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of intangibles on an ongoing basis 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles when there is an indication of impairment  or at least once a year 
goodwill impairment is indicated when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value  calculated based on anticipated discounted cash flows 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on discounted cash flows similar to models employed in analyzing the purchase price of an acquisition target 
intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment on the basis of the expected future undiscounted operating cash flows  without interest charges  to be derived from these assets 
we review definite lived intangible assets for impairment when there is an indication of impairment  or at least once a year 
during the quarter ended march   we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived and definite lived intangible assets and we determined that there was no impairment to these assets as of october  in performing our analysis  we used certain assumptions and estimates including those related to discount rates and the expected future period of cash flows to be derived from the assets  based on  among other factors  historical trends and the characteristics of the assets 
while we believe that our testing was appropriate  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise increase amortization expense 
income taxes as a multinational corporation  we operate in various locations outside the united states 
as of september   and based on tax laws in effect as of this date  it is our intention to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  we have not made a provision for us taxes and have not recorded a deferred tax liability on billion of cumulative undistributed earnings recorded by foreign subsidiaries as of september  changes to our policy of reinvesting foreign earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law on october  under a provision of the act  we may elect to repatriate certain earnings of our foreign based subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate in either of our fiscal years ending september  or september  we are currently evaluating the effect of this repatriation provision  however  we do not expect to complete this evaluation until after the us congress or the us department of the treasury issue additional guidance regarding this provision 
the range of possible amounts we are considering for repatriation is between zero and billion and the potential range of income tax associated with amounts subject to the reduced rate is between zero and million 
valuation of investments we record substantially all investments in our financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
where available  we use prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker or dealer price quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  we estimate the value of the securities based upon available information 
however  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  some assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for example  we generally assume that the size of positions in securities that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities when sold  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized on sale could differ from the current carrying value 
we evaluate our investments for other than temporary decline in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
as most of our investments are carried at fair value  if an other than temporary decline in value is determined to exist  the unrealized investment loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income  in the period in which the other than temporary decline in value is determined 
in fiscal  we recognized million for an other than temporary decline in the value of certain investments 
we classify securities as trading when it is management s intent at the time of purchase to sell the security within a short period of time 
accordingly  we record unrealized gains and losses on these securities in our consolidated income 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary decline in value in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our financial statements 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claim based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for any probable losses that may arise from these matters 
see also legal proceedings included in part i  item of this report and risk factors below 
variable interest entities under fin r  a variable interest entity vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment 
fin r requires consolidation of a vie by the enterprise that has the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership  referred to as the primary beneficiary 
evaluating whether related entities are vies and determining if we qualify as the primary beneficiary of these vies  is highly complex and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
to determine our interest in the expected losses or residual returns of each vie  we performed an expected cash flow analysis using certain discount rate and volatility assumptions based on available historical information and management s estimates 
based on our analysis  we did not consolidate any vies in our financial statements as of september  while we believe that our testing and approach were appropriate  future changes in estimates and assumptions may affect our decision and lead to the consolidation of one or more vies in our financial statements 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in historical dollars without considering the effect of inflation 
since a significant portion of our assets are liquid in nature  the potential effect of inflation is mitigated 
in addition  the majority of our revenues and related expenses are denominated in us dollars  a currency that has not been significantly affected by the impact of changes in prices in recent years 
to the extent that a potential rise in inflation may affect the securities and the consumer lending markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operation in the future

we compete with numerous investment management companies  stock brokerage and investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  savings and loan associations and other financial institutions 
continuing consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels than our own 
additionally  competing securities broker dealers whom we rely upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and investment products  which could limit the distribution of our investment products 
to the extent that existing or potential customers  including securities broker dealers  decide to invest in or distribute the products of our competitors  the sales of our products as well as our market share  revenues and net income could decline 
changes in the distribution channels on which we depend could reduce our revenues and hinder our growth 
we derive nearly all of our fund sales through broker dealers and other similar investment advisers 
increasing competition for these distribution channels and recent regulatory initiatives  have caused our distribution costs to rise and could cause further increases in the future 
higher distribution costs lower our net revenues and earnings 
additionally  if one of the major financial advisers who distribute our products were to cease their operations  it could have a significant adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
moreover  our failure to maintain strong business relationships with these advisers would impair our ability to distribute and sell our products  which would have a negative effect on our level of assets under management  related revenues and overall business and financial condition 
we have become subject to an increased risk of volatility of the assets we manage caused by changes in the financial and equity markets 
we have become subject to an increased risk of asset volatility from changes in the domestic and global financial and equity markets due to the continuing threat of terrorism 
declines in these markets have caused in the past  and would cause in the future  a decline in our revenue and income 
the levels of our assets under management  which impact revenues  are subject to significant fluctuations 
global economic conditions  changes in the equity market place  interest rates  inflation rates  the yield curve and other factors that are difficult to predict affect the mix  market values and levels of our assets under management 
changing market conditions may cause a shift in our asset mix towards fixed income products and a related decline in our revenue and income  since we generally derive higher fee revenues and income from equity assets than from fixed income products we manage 
similarly  our securitized consumer receivables business is subject to marketplace fluctuation  including economic and credit market downturns 
we face risks associated with conducting operations in numerous foreign countries 
we sell mutual funds and offer investment advisory and related services in many different regulatory jurisdictions around the world  and intend to continue to expand our operations internationally 
regulators in these jurisdictions could change their policies or laws in a manner that might restrict or otherwise impede our ability to distribute or register investment products in their respective markets 
our ability to successfully integrate widely varied business lines can be impeded by systems and other technological limitations 
our continued success in effectively managing and growing our business both domestically and abroad  depends on our ability to integrate the varied accounting  financial  information and operational systems of our various businesses on a global basis 
our inability to meet cash needs could have a negative effect on our financial condition and business operations 
our ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon factors including our asset value  our creditworthiness as perceived by lenders and the market value of our stock 
similarly  our ability to securitize and hedge future loan portfolios and credit card receivables  and to obtain continued financing for certain class c shares  is also subject to the market s perception of those assets  finance rates offered by competitors  and the general market for private debt 
if we are unable to obtain these funds and financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plans 
certain of the portfolios we manage  including our emerging market portfolios  and related revenues are vulnerable to market specific political or economic risks 
our emerging market portfolios and revenues derived from managing these portfolios are subject to significant risks of loss from political and diplomatic developments  currency fluctuations  social instability  changes in governmental polices  expropriation  nationalization  asset confiscation and changes in legislation related to foreign ownership 
foreign trading markets  particularly in some emerging market countries are often smaller  less liquid  less regulated and significantly more volatile than the us and other established markets 
diverse and strong competition limits the interest rates that we can charge on consumer loans 
we compete with many types of institutions for consumer loans  which can provide loans at significantly below market interest rates in connection with automobile sales or in some cases zero interest rates 
our inability to compete effectively against these companies or to maintain our relationships with the various automobile dealers through whom we offer consumer loans could limit the growth of our consumer loan business 
economic and credit market downturns could reduce the ability of our customers to repay loans  which could cause our consumer loan portfolio losses to increase 
we are subject to federal reserve board regulation 
upon completion of our acquisition of fiduciary trust in april  we became a bank holding company and a financial holding company subject to the supervision and regulation of the federal reserve board the frb 
we are subject to the restrictions  limitations  or prohibitions of the bank holding company act of and the gramm leach bliley act 
the frb may impose additional limitations or restrictions on our activities  including if the frb believes that we do not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an activity or make an acquisition 
technology and operating risk and limitations could constrain our operations 
we are highly dependent on the integrity of our technology  operating systems and premises 
although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans  we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters  power failures  acts of war  and third party failures  which could negatively impact our operations 
governmental investigations  settlements of such investigations  ongoing and proposed governmental actions  and regulatory examinations of the company and its business activities as well as civil litigation arising out of or related to such matters could adversely impact our assets under management  increase costs and negatively impact the profitability of the company and future financial results

the company s internal inquiry regarding market timing and late trading is complete

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to market risk the potential loss due to changes in the value of investments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign exchange and or equity prices 
management is responsible for managing this risk 
our enterprise risk management committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify  assess and manage market and other risks 
our banking finance operating segment is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its loans receivable  debt securities held  and deposit liabilities 
in our banking finance operating segment  we monitor the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources 
in addition  as of september   we have considered the potential impact of the effect on the banking finance operating segment balances  individually and collectively  of a basis point movement in market interest rates 
based on our analysis  we do not expect that this change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in either scenario 
our investment management operating segment is exposed to changes in interest rates through its investment in debt securities and its outstanding debt 
we minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities  and through diversification 
our exposure to interest rate changes related to our debt issuances is not material since a significant percentage of our outstanding debt is at fixed interest rates 
we are subject to foreign exchange risk through our foreign operations 
we operate primarily in the united states  but also provide services and earn revenues in canada  the bahamas  europe  asia  south america  africa and australia 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimized since a significant portion of these revenues and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
this situation may change in the future as our business continues to grow outside the united states 
we are exposed to equity price fluctuations through securities we hold that are carried at fair value and through investments held by majority owned sponsored investment products that we consolidate 
to mitigate this risk  we maintain a diversified investment portfolio 
our exposure to equity price fluctuations is also minimized as we sponsor a broad range of investment products in various global jurisdictions
