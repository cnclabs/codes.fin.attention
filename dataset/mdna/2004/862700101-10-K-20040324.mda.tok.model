overview the company develops  manufactures and markets immunoassay and bioluminescence based test kits for rapid and cost effective detection of a wide variety of substances in the food safety and water quality markets and also provides antibody and immunoreagent research  development and production services to medical diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  as well as research institutions 
since its inception  the company and its predecessors have  in addition to conducting internal research and development of new products  entered into research and development agreements with multiple corporate partners that have led to the introduction of various products to the food safety  water quality and other markets 
the company expects that internal research and development projects  primarily in the food safety area  will continue to represent a larger percentage of its research and development expenditures 
the company believes that its competitive position has been enhanced through the combination of talent  technology and resources resulting from the relationships it developed and the acquisitions it concluded during the past five years 
these relationships and acquisitions have enabled the company to achieve meaningful economies of scale for the unique products it offers through the utilization of its consolidated facilities in newark  delaware  for the manufacture of test kits and antibodies  its facility located in oceanside  california  for the manufacture of instruments  and its facility located in windham  maine for the manufacture of antibodies 
on july   the company purchased certain assets of molecular circuitry  inc mci 
the purchased assets consist primarily of various proprietary growth media technology that will be used in combination with the company s diagnostic tests for food borne pathogens  including salmonella and e 
coli 
the assets purchased also include the sales and marketing rights to the ruminant feed test product line that the company and mci had been jointly developing 

table of contents on september   the company acquired azur environmental azur  a privately held manufacturer of proprietary rapid test systems  including the microtox toxicity test system  which measures toxicity in drinking and process water 
mentioned in more than peer reviewed scientific articles and with more than  instruments sold worldwide  the microtox toxicity test system has been approved in regulations or standards in canada  eight european countries  and has been submitted to the us environmental protection agency for approval 
see part i  item business for a more complete discussion of the company s line of business  principal products  market opportunities and competition 
the company believes that its products in the food safety and water quality testing markets are unique and fill potentially large  unmet needs for rapid  easy to use analytical methods 
the company also believes that its products and technology currently being developed have broad application in diverse markets including the food and beverage and water treatment industries 
the company believes that an established product base  quality manufacturing expertise  experienced sales and marketing organization  established network of distributors  corporate partner relationships and proven research and development expertise will be critical elements of its potential future success 
accomplishments the strength of the company is in applying biotech solutions to customer problems 
this stems from a history of working with customers to develop bio detection systems that are fast  cost effective  and that enhance the safety  quality and value of the many products our customers deliver to their customers 
to this end  the company achieved the following significant milestones in in food pathogens  the company introduced and began commercially selling its rapidchek e 
coli o and salmonella test systems  and continued the development of its listeria test system the rapidchek salmonella test systems received third party validation from the aoac for a variety of foods in february the company released its feedchek tm screening test for the detection of meat and bone meal in animal feed  which is linked to the transmission of bse  commonly known as mad cow disease in gm trait testing  the company introduced and began commercially selling traitchek tm lateral flow strip tests for the detection of cryf herculex tm i and crybb yieldgard rootworm  which were also certified by the usda grain inspection packers and stockyards administration gipsa in water quality  the company sold over microtox and deltatox instruments  primarily in the drinking water utility market  and sold three units to food companies  which is a target market for the company in growth and profit improvement opportunities growth strategies for the company include developing new product applications from existing technologies  such as the application of the microtox technology  which was traditionally applied in drinking water applications  to the food and beverage industry 
introducing new products into the food pathogen testing market  including rapidchek listeria  additional versions of the company s salmonella test and wider utilization of proprietary growth media 
exploring new channels to market  including co marketing relationships 

table of contents improving profit margins through changing product mix  increased volume and more efficient manufacturing operations  including the potential introduction of automation 
potentially acquiring or licensing new technologies or products  when financially and strategically attractive 
economic and industry wide factors as industry continues to look for ways to reduce costs  the company believes there will be a continual shift from testing  which requires highly trained personnel  expensive equipment and lengthy turnaround times for test results  to more rapid  accurate and cost effective testing which can be performed by less highly trained personnel and completed in minutes or hours 
the global market for food pathogen testing continues to increase due to the globalization of food supply  the establishment of harmonized quality standards  the consumer s desire for fresher  more ready to eat foods and foods from diverse geographies  and increasing regulatory and media scrutiny 
the trend of increasing acceptance of gm crops and the introduction of new traits may drive additional demand for the company s products in order to maintain identity preservation and tracking 
seasonality sales levels for certain agricultural products may be impacted by seasonal demand trends 
the demand for these test kits is typically higher in the first and third quarters due to harvesting patterns 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues increased million or in over the following table sets out revenues by product category 
year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands water quality food safety antibody contract and other net revenues revenues for the water quality category decreased slightly in  primarily due to decreasing sales of the company s remediation and pesticide test kits  which the company believes was the result of weak general economic conditions in the national land development and construction industries 
this decrease was offset by an increase in sales of the company microtox toxicity screening systems during  with over instruments sold during  including three instruments sold into the food industry  compared to a total of instruments sold during the company is expanding its efforts to market its microtox test systems to potential customers in the food and beverage industry to screen water as a key product ingredient  and the company expects water quality revenues to grow in food safety revenues increased in  led by sales of the company s e 
coli testing kits 
the company entered the food pathogen testing market in early and saw a number of customers in the beef processing industry convert to the company s e 
coli pathogen test from competitive lateral flow e 
coli 
table of contents tests 
the e 
coli test system  which includes both an enrichment media and a rapid assay  continues to display superior sensitivity and specificity to e 
coli o as compared to competing tests and  as a screening method  allows customers to avoid using slower  more costly methods on the vast majority of their samples 
other developments include a recently completed government sponsored study that demonstrated the company s e 
coli enrichment media outperformed the standard method 
also during  the company released its salmonella test  which is the most common bacteria test with respect to a wide variety of foods including meats  dairy and processed foods 
customer adoption of the company s salmonella test has been slower than expected  which the company attributes to the breadth and complexity of food matrices in this test segment and well entrenched competitive assays 
the company continued its product development efforts with its listeria product in an effort to ensure compliance with the october us department of agriculture food safety and inspection service directives regarding environmental testing 
in addition  the company wants to ensure  prior to commercial launch of the product  that it has identified and developed the product features and benefits that would deliver greatest advantage to the marketplace in either the enrichment phase or the assay itself or both 
the company s focus with all food pathogen testing products is to give the customer a lower total cost of ownership by providing the required specificity and sensitivity  while enhancing ease of use  time to result and work flow management 
since the company is a new entrant into this testing segment and holds a relatively small share of the market  and it believes its products attributes are competitive  the company expects revenues to grow in this area in food safety sales of the company s products to detect genetically modified gm traits increased slightly in compared to  primarily driven by the company s increasing penetration into the cottonseed and brazilian soy testing markets  which was partially offset by the continued reduction in starlink test kit sales 
increased testing in the brazilian market was primarily driven by the government opening its regulations to the planting of genetically modified soy  which it had not allowed previously 
sales of the company s test kits to detect starlink were approximately million and million  in and  respectively 
we expect starlink test kit sales to continue to decrease in the company has seen the introduction of new commercial products by the large agricultural biotechnology companies  including traits to protect corn crops from the corn rootworm  a pest more prevalent than the european corn bore and herbicide resistant corn 
the company has developed  validated and begun to sell tests to detect these traits  including traitchek tm for the detection of cryf herculex tm i and crybb yieldgard rootworm 
the company believes that this trend of new trait introduction will continue  as large agricultural biotechnology companies have publicly stated their commitment and investment in this technology area  and that as a result  demand for the company s testing products  other than tests for starlink  will increase as well 
many countries outside the us and canada have adopted labeling regulations that could stimulate demand for the company s products  as well as food manufacturers developing protocols to comply with these regulations 
in february the company released its screening test  known as feedchek tm  for the detection of meat and bone meal in animal feed  which is linked to the transmission of bse  commonly known as mad cow disease 
the transmission of mad cow disease is believed to be linked to the use of rendered meat and bone meal as a protein supplement in animal feed 
meat and bone meal made from cattle has been banned for use in cattle feed since in both canada and the usa  but it can be used legally in feed for poultry  swine and household pets  none of which are known to contract mad cow disease 
during  cases of mad cow have been found in the us  canada and japan 
the market and regulatory environment in the united states  canada and japan continues to be in a state of flux 
food  feed and regulatory agencies are looking at the adequacy of current approaches but there have been no significant policy revisions or decisions to date 
the company has met with regulators and industry leaders  and continues to support and participate in policy making discussions around the testing of animal feed 

table of contents feedchek tm was designed to be more sensitive and easier to use than other rapid  on site methods 
compared to certain competitive products  this test does not require weighing or boiling of samples 
by eliminating these steps  the feedchek tm test is faster  easier to use and will not require equipment such as scales and heating devices 
this method for animal feed has been designed with multiple tests per assay to address the various analytical requirements throughout the world 
feedchek tm is the only test available which provides results for both mammalian meat and bone meal and poultry meal 
poultry meal is currently prohibited from use in cattle feed in europe 
the feedchek tm product has been shown to detect as little as bovine meat and bone meal in feed 
these product features are important to comply with feed specifications and governmental regulations throughout the us  europe and japan 
the company s feedchek tm test participated in a comparison study performed by the joint research centre jrc of the european union 
the study findings demonstrated that the company s test had sensitivity  specificity and accuracy when analyzing for total processed animal proteins  and was the only immunoassay method to provide this level of performance 
antibody revenues increased primarily due to the attraction of new customers and the growth of sales to existing accounts  as customers saw the strength of the production capabilities  the quality programs and project management services  which were among the improvements made when the company consolidated its production facilities in maine in contract and other revenue declined as the company continued to place greater emphasis on devoting its research and development resources on internal projects  particularly in the food safety category 
operating expenses operating expenses increased million in  due to higher manufacturing expenses  which was a result of the company taking a non cash charge of million in connection with the write down of certain inventories 
this non cash charge is a result of the company undertaking a strategic review of its operations in a manner designed to ensure the company focuses its resources on its most promising growth opportunities 
the company s evaluation included  but was not been limited to  the efficiency and effectiveness of the company s sales operations and manufacturing processes  the company s product offerings  the company s key channels to market  the size and opportunities within the principal markets targeted by the company as well as those presented by the company s existing customer base 
the write down reflects the company s decision to exit its catalog antibody business and to focus on its custom and made to order sales of antibody products  and the elimination of inventories of test kit products that are not contributing significantly to revenue or profitability 
the goal of this effort was to improve operational and supply chain efficiencies of the company 
gross profits total revenues less manufacturing costs decreased  or  to million  and gross margin declined to in from in the decline in gross margin is primarily attributable to the company taking a non cash charge of million in connection with the write down of certain inventories 
excluding the impact of the non cash charge of million in  gross profits would have increased approximately million  or  and gross margin would have increased to in from in this gross margin improvement reflects the full year impact resulting from the consolidation of the california antibody production facility into the maine location  which was completed in  and by the company s initiatives taken in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter to consolidate its former segments and leverage its manufacturing capacity and improve production yields 
gross margin is expected to improve in  as the company expects growth in revenues and continued improvement in operational and supply chain efficiencies 
research and development expenses decreased  primarily due to higher expenses in the prior year associated with the development efforts of the company s food pathogen and animal feed test  and continued emphasis on devoting research and development resources to internal projects rather than undertaking contract research projects for third parties 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses declined  in compared to  as the company took steps to reduce its overall cost structure 
included in the selling  general and administrative expenses of million for is a  provision for severance and related expenses associated with the company s termination of its former ceo in may and coo in late december interest expense  net net interest expense decreased  due to the lower average debt levels and higher levels of invested cash when comparing to income taxes income tax benefit decreased by  largely due to the smaller pre tax loss recorded in compared to the company s annual effective tax rate benefit of for primarily reflects the federal statutory rate of  state taxes  net of federal effect of and research and development credits of 
non gaap financial measures excluding the non cash inventory write down of million and the  provision for severance and related costs  both tax effected at the statutory rate of  the net income for would have been million  or 
per diluted share 
the company added back the items below because they are outside of our normal operations 
the company believes the inclusion of such non gaap measures helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results  consistent with how management measures the company s performance  especially when comparing such results to previous periods  including when the company had a net loss of  twelve months ended december  in thousands  except per share data net loss  as reported add inventory write down of million  net of related tax effect at add severance costs of  net of related tax effect at pro forma net income earnings loss per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues net revenues decreased million or in over the following table sets out revenues by product category 
year ended december  increase decrease percent change in thousands water quality food safety antibody contract and other net revenues 
table of contents revenues for the water quality category increased slightly in  primarily due to increasing sales of the microtox toxicity screening systems  with more than north american water systems  most of which serve more than  households  utilizing the system for drinking water 
the increase in microtox sales was somewhat offset by a decrease in sales of tests in the remediation market 
sales in this category were slower due to weak general economic conditions 
food safety revenues decreased primarily due to the million decline in of starlink test kits to million from record sales levels in  of million  as the removal of starlink corn from the nation s grain supply commenced late in starlink  which was approved only for non food uses  was discovered in food products in and resulted in the need for growers  handlers  processors  shippers and exporters to test corn for the presence of starlink 
sales of company s gmo tests for cottonseed increased during antibody revenues declined slightly in as the company completed the consolidation of its san diego  california  operations into a single site at its maine location during several new or expanded relationships were established during as customers and prospects had the opportunity to validate manufacturing and quality procedures at the expanded manufacturing facilities in maine  which were among the improvements made when the company consolidated its production facilities 
contract and other revenue declined as the company continued to place greater emphasis on devoting its research and development resources on internal projects  particularly in the food safety category 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million or in  due primarily to lower manufacturing expenses  as a result of lower starlink related sales volume in gross profits total revenues less manufacturing costs decreased million or to million and gross margins declined to in from in the decline in gross margins was primarily attributable to the fact that the company s utilization of its manufacturing capacity was reduced as compared to  a result of lower sales volume during  resulting primarily from reduced starlink related sales 
the company instituted several initiatives late in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter to leverage its manufacturing capacity and improve its production yields 
one such effort was the elimination of separate test kit and antibody business units  resulting in a single manufacturing organization 
research and development expenses increased  or  primarily due to continued investment in the animal feed test and the lateral flow food pathogen tests 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately the same in the year as in other income in  the company sold most of the remaining assets of its antibody production facility near san diego  california 
the company recorded a gain on sale of  which represents the amount the company received above the carrying value of the assets sold 
also during  the company reached an agreement with its insurance carrier in settlement of costs related to a building fire on its maine property 
the company recorded a gain on disposal of  which represents the amount the company received above its investment in the assets destroyed 
interest expense net net interest expense increased  or  due to the lower levels of interest income associated with lower levels of invested cash throughout versus income taxes income tax expense decreased million  largely due to the pre tax loss recorded in the company s annual effective tax rate benefit of for primarily reflects the federal statutory rate of  state taxes  net of federal benefit of and research and development credits of 
net income net income decreased million in when compared to for the reasons described above  in particular the decline in gross profits of million which resulted primarily from lower revenues  principally related to the decrease in starlink related sales 
the decline in gross profits was partially offset by other income of  and the income tax benefit of  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet the company s obligations and commitments  or obtain appropriate financing 
currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on indebtedness  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
the following is a summary of selected cash flow information year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect on exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents although the company incurred a net loss in  net cash provided by operating activities was million for due to the million decline in inventory  resulting from the non cash charge of million 
the net cash used in operating activities of  for was primarily the result of the net loss for the period of  net cash used in investing activities of  for was driven by the capital expenditures for the period of  this compares to net cash used in investing activities of  for which was driven by the capital expenditures for the period of million  which was offset by proceeds from the sale and disposal of assets of  the capital expenditures for period were primarily related to manufacturing equipment and for the period related to building construction and improvements due to the consolidation of the company s san diego  california  operations into a single site at its maine location 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for was primarily driven proceeds from the exercise of stock options  which was partially offset by net repayments of outstanding debt 
this compares to net cash provided by financing activities of  for which was primarily driven by proceeds from the sale of million of the company s common stock to outside directors  which was partially offset by million in net repayments of outstanding debt 
the company s working capital  current assets less current liabilities  decreased  to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to the million non cash write down of inventories 
outstanding debt decreased  from million at december  to million on december   due to scheduled repayments 
on may   the company entered into a financing agreement with a commercial bank 
this agreement provides for a  term loan  all of which had been paid on or before december   and for up to a  revolving line of credit  none of which was outstanding and approximately  of which was available at december   based on eligible assets 
on december  the company entered into an agreement with a commercial bank to finance the construction of new facilities at its windham  maine location 
this agreement provides for up to  in financing   of which was outstanding at december   and is repayable over seven years  with principal payments beginning on october  under the terms of the above financing  the company is required to meet certain quarterly financial covenants 
the loan covenants were modified to a minimum quick ratio of and a minimum tangible net worth ratio of  for the first three quarters of  and the company met the requirements during those periods 
beginning with the fourth quarter of  the original provisions of the loan agreement regarding financial covenants was operative  namely a ratio of ebitda to current maturities of debt plus interest and cash paid for taxes greater than and a ratio of 
table of contents funded debt to ebitda not to exceed 
the company was not in compliance with these fourth quarter covenants at december  in february  the company amended the terms of the ebitda covenants with its bank to exclude the impact of up to million of charges the company incurred in the fourth quarter  primarily the non cash write down of inventories  and therefore  the company met the covenant requirements for the fourth quarter under the amended covenant  the company expects that it will be able to meet all of its financial covenants with respect to this indebtedness for for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from the net cash provide by operating activities  cash available and on hand and from the financing agreements described above 
at december   the company had million in long term debt and stockholders equity of million 
although the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures at december   it does anticipate that it may spend approximately  in to upgrade or expand certain manufacturing  research development and office equipment and systems that will drive productivity or generate cost savings  and also to introduce automation into certain manufacturing processes that are currently labor intensive 
contractual obligations the company is committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts our long term indebtedness and leases 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations 
below is a schedule of the future payments that the company was obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  in thousands payments due by year total and beyond long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations see discussion in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long term debt 
see discussion of operating leases in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon its cash on hand  credit facilities  current product sales and the anticipated sales of new products  the company believes it has  or has access to  sufficient resources to meet its operating requirements at least through january the company s ability to meet its long term capital needs will depend on a number of factors  including compliance with existing and new loan covenants  the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy  its successful sale of additional common stock and or the company s successfully locating and obtaining other financing  and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to meet the future liquidity requirements that may arise from these inherent and similar uncertainties 
accounting standards critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
table of contents during the year 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  deferred taxes  long lived assets and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable as of december  and december   were net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
the recorded allowance is continually evaluated based on current market conditions  an analysis of customer specific facts and circumstances  and the size and composition of the overall portfolio 
if receivables become uncollectible  these write offs are charged against the allowance 
valuation of inventories inventories  which consist primarily of test kit components  bulk antibody serum and antibody products are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
realization of inventories is dependent upon the successful marketing of our products 
judgments are made regarding the carrying value of inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions and customer demand 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by the company impacts the market for previously released products  the company may be required to write down the cost of its inventory 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of existing temporary differences  projected future taxable income  the expected reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax items are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowances at december  at december   management has concluded that a full valuation allowance is necessary for deferred tax assets in certain state jurisdictions and the entire balance of foreign deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition product related sales are composed of the sale of immunoassay and bioluminescence based test kits and the sale of antibodies and immunochemical reagents 
the sale of all immunoassay and bioluminescence based test kits  antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized upon the shipment of the product and transfer of title or when related services are provided 
for the twelve months ended december   and these sales represented  and of total company revenues  respectively 
sales of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies under customer contracts and purchase orders are recognized under the percentage of completion method and are recorded based on the percentage of costs or time incurred through the reporting date versus the estimate for the complete contract or project 
the company recognizes revenues in this manner as production of these types of antibodies generally takes between two and twelve months to complete and costs are incurred throughout the production process 
for the twelve months ended december   and these sales represented  and of total company revenues  respectively 
contract revenues are recognized upon the completion of contractual milestones 
for the twelve months ended december   and these sales represented  and of total company revenues  respectively 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value
