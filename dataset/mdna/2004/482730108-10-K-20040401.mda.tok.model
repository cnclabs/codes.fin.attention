item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction for a description of k tron s business  refer to item of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item  we are engaged in one principal business segment material handling equipment and systems 
we operate in two primary geographic locations north and south america the americas and europe  the middle east  africa and asia emea asia 
we have three main business lines within the material handling equipment and systems segment 
they are  in descending order of revenues in  our feeding  size reduction and pneumatic conveying business lines 
prior to the january  acquisition of penn crusher  our feeding line  whose products are sold worldwide  was the main profit contributor within our group of businesses 
during the past three years  capital equipment spending by our customers has been depressed due to the global economic slowdown and excess manufacturing capacity built up in the late s in the united states 
this has been particularly true for the plastics and chemical industries  which comprise a major share of our market for feeding equipment 
management looks at trends in indicators  such as the pmi index for manufacturing published by the institute of supply management  to judge the prospects for capital equipment spending 
these indicators began to show improvement in the latter part of historically  improvements in our feeding equipment sales generally lag improvements in these indicators  in some cases by as much as six to twelve months 
the majority of revenues and profits in our feeding line is generated by equipment and systems sales  with a lesser amount attributable to service  parts and repairs 
the k tron feeder group recently installed a common worldwide enterprise resource planning erp software system  which is expected to make internal processes more efficient  reduce errors and shorten the time from order to delivery 
there also is an ongoing initiative to standardize our feeding equipment worldwide to improve overall operating efficiency and streamline service requirements 
new product innovation is a major objective of our r d efforts 
our feeder group has the ability to serve nearly all geographic regions of the world from its two assembly and test facilities in pitman  new jersey and niederlenz  switzerland 
our size reduction business line was added with the purchase of penn crusher and jeffrey on january  in contrast to our feeding line  penn crusher and jeffrey sell equipment primarily into us markets  with some sales into china and other foreign countries 
the main industries served are the electric utility  mining  pulp and paper and wood and forest products industries  and a majority of revenues and profits are generated from replacement part sales instead of new equipment 
both penn crusher and jeffrey maintain an extensive database of previously sold equipment  including equipment drawings  which enables them to respond quickly and efficiently to fill customers spare parts orders 
our size reduction business line saw a modest decline in as a result of lower economic activity  excess plant capacity and financial restructuring in the power industry 
significant indicators that management uses to judge prospects for this business line in north america include the level of electricity consumption  the financial health of the electric utility industry and the demand for paper and forest products 

table of contents our pneumatic conveying line comprises a relatively small portion of our overall revenues 
this equipment is sometimes sold through the k tron feeder group in conjunction with feeder equipment as a means of transporting a dry material from one part of a plant to the inlet of a feeder  and the companies in the pneumatic conveying group also sell equipment and complete systems in applications which do not necessarily incorporate feeders 
aside from selling into markets common to the feeder line  the pneumatic conveying group also sells into the plastics extrusion and molding markets 
most of the revenues and profits of this line are generated from equipment and systems sales 
the factors affecting the pneumatic conveying line are similar to those affecting the feeder line but also include factors which may affect the secondary plastics market generally 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended january   december  and december   respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in certain areas 
following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates determination of an asset s useful life  estimates of allowances for bad debts  cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  estimates of the realizability of deferred tax assets  determination of the adequacy of the reserves for inventory obsolescence and warranty costs  and legal contingencies 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
we base our critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates we believe to be reasonable 
certain of the more critical assumptions include depreciable lives of plant and equipment changes in technology wear and tear changes in market demand bad debt risk credit worthiness of specific customers and aging of customer balances contractual rights and obligations general and specific economic conditions 
table of contents asset impairment determinations intended use of assets and expected future cash flows industry specific trends and economic conditions customer preferences and behavior patterns impact of regulatory initiatives deferred taxes expected future profitability and cash flows impact of regulatory initiatives timing of reversals of existing temporary differences between book and taxable income inventory reserve new product introductions current product demand product life cycle changes past experience warranty cost new product introductions past experience legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings 
results of operations overview fiscal was a week year  while fiscal years and were week years 
in  and  we reported revenues of   and  and net income of   and  respectively 
the significant revenue increase from and levels largely reflected the january  acquisition of penn crusher  partly offset by a decline in revenues from the other parts of our business reflecting a poor global economy and continued weakness in capital equipment spending in the process industries we serve 

table of contents the improvement in net income in versus was also due to the acquisition of penn crusher  the effect of which was partly offset by lower profits in the k tron feeder group as a result of the weak global economy and the reduced capital equipment spending previously mentioned 
the improvement in net income in versus was largely caused by two factors  the sale of our hasler heavy feeder business in the third quarter of and the benefits of a lower cost structure resulting from the globalization and cost reduction initiatives that we implemented in the second half of acquisitions divestitures on july   we sold our hasler heavy feeder business to our largest distributor of hasler equipment and recorded a pretax loss of  the assets sold were primarily inventory and fixed assets 
the buyer assumed the lease of the hasler sales office in neuch tel  switzerland and leased from us a company owned facility in lengerich  germany 
the purchase price consisted of a combination of  swiss francs cash  two promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of  swiss francs  which bear interest and amortize over seven years  and a less than equity position in the buyer 
we retained all of the hasler receivables and payables at the time of the sale  as well as the owned building in lengerich  germany which  as noted above  is being leased to the buyer 
the buyer has made all required payments on the promissory notes  and the unpaid principal amount of such notes was  swiss francs  at the end of on november   we acquired pneumatic conveying systems limited pcs 
the purchase price was  british pounds sterling  which was paid in a combination of cash and notes  and the notes have now been fully paid 
in december  we sold our swiss machine and welding shops to an independent swiss machine shop company and recorded a pretax gain of  the purchase price consisted of a combination of  swiss francs cash  and a  swiss franc obligation  which is supported by a bank guaranty and had been reduced to  swiss francs  at the end of the us dollar numbers mentioned in the foregoing three paragraphs reflect relevant foreign currency exchange rates at the several dates referred to 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of penn crusher 
as a result of this purchase  we also acquired jeffrey  a wholly owned subsidiary of penn crusher 
the purchase price for the penn crusher stock was  paid at closing  a post closing adjustment of  based on penn crusher s consolidated stockholders equity at december  and  in the quarter ended january  in conjunction with the company s irs code section h election relating to such acquisition 
of this amount   was paid in cash and  was in unsecured promissory notes which are payable in equal  annual installments on january of  and with respect to the payment of the cash portion of the purchase price and related acquisition costs other than the section h election  we financed  through a  secured credit facility with penn crusher as the borrower and jeffrey as the guarantor with the additional  being available for working capital and general corporate purposes  subject to certain limitations  and the lender has no recourse against any other k tron company with respect to any amounts borrowed thereunder except by a 
table of contents non recourse pledge of the stock of penn crusher 
additionally  we borrowed  from a us bank through another k tron wholly owned subsidiary and used these funds to pay part of the purchase price 
this obligation was guaranteed by k tron international  and k tron international also issued the  of unsecured promissory notes 
as noted above  k tron and penn crusher incurred substantial debt as a result of the penn crusher acquisition 
this debt  including the amounts outstanding at the end of  is described in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below  however  k tron and penn crusher have met all required principal and interest payments and expect their cash flows to be adequate to cover all future principal and interest payments on these borrowings 
foreign exchange rates we are an international company  and we derived approximately  and of our  and revenues  respectively  from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities located outside the united states  primarily in europe 
since we operate globally  we are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange rates  which can affect both the translation of financial statement items into us dollars as well as transactions where the revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in different currencies  such as sales made from our swiss manufacturing facility in currencies other than the swiss franc 
with the acquisition of penn crusher and jeffrey  we were less affected in by foreign exchange rates since most of their sales are in us dollars 
nevertheless  between and of our revenues will likely be from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities outside the united states  so that we will continue to have significant sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
since we have received substantial revenues in recent years from activities in foreign jurisdictions  our results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates  particularly in us dollar exchange rates with respect to the swiss franc  euro and british pound sterling and  to a lesser degree  the singapore dollar and other currencies 
when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based sales increases 
when the non us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based sales decreases 
correspondingly  the us dollar value of us dollar based costs increases when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
overall  our revenues in us dollars generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide  especially those identified above 
in particular  a general weakening of the us dollar against other currencies would positively affect our revenues  gross profit and operating income as expressed in us dollars provided that the gross profit and operating income numbers from foreign operations are not losses  since in the case of a loss  the effect would be to increase the loss  whereas a general strengthening of the us dollar against such currencies would have the opposite effect 
in addition  our revenues and income with respect to particular transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale 

table of contents for  and  the changes in certain key exchange rates affecting the company were as follows fiscal year average us dollar equivalent of one swiss franc change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one euro change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one british pound sterling change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one euro change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one british pound sterling change vs 
prior year presentation of results and analysis the following table sets forth our results of operations  expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated  as well as our backlog fiscal year total revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income interest income before income taxes year end backlog at year end foreign exchange rates  in thousands of dollars 
table of contents total revenues increased by  or in compared to this increase in revenues was mainly the result of acquiring penn crusher on january   which contributed revenues of  and the positive effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of the revenues of foreign operations into us dollars 
the increase resulting from these two factors was partly offset by a decline in revenues in our other businesses as a result of a weaker global economy  a reduction in spending for industrial capital equipment in the process industries we serve and the effects of the sars outbreak in asia in the early part of if the average foreign exchange rates for were applied to  total revenues for would have increased by  or versus the  and on an as reported basis 
total revenues decreased by  or in compared to  but increased by  or without the hasler heavy feeder business which was sold on july  this increase in revenues without hasler was driven by twelve full months of revenues in from the november  acquisition of pcs versus one month in and the positive effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of the revenues of foreign operations into us dollars 
such increase was partially offset by lower revenues in emea asia and the americas due to a weaker global economy and a reduction in capital equipment spending in the process industries we serve 
if the average foreign exchange rates for were applied to  total revenues for would have decreased by  or and would have decreased by  or without hasler 
gross profit as a percent of total revenues decreased to in from in this decline was caused by a change in our sales mix as well as by lower margins on jeffrey equipment which affected only gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased to in from in the improvement was primarily due to an improved sales mix as a result of the july  sale of the hasler heavy feeder business and to reductions in fixed costs  including those made in the second half of  and the elimination of goodwill expense when we adopted sfas no 
on december  goodwill amortization for was selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by  or in compared to this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of penn crusher in and employee termination costs in the k tron feeder group 
in addition  sg a increased as a result of the adverse effect of a weaker us dollar when translating costs in foreign currencies into us dollars 
sg a expenses decreased by  or in compared to a decrease of approximately  or after excluding hasler sg a  the loss on the sale of the hasler heavy feeder business and the gain on the sale of the swiss machine and welding shops discussed above 
the decrease in sg a in was primarily due to the elimination of hasler sg a after the sale of hasler on july   fewer employees and the benefits realized from the cost reductions implemented in the second half of  but such decrease was offset in part by the effect of higher foreign exchange rates a weaker us dollar 
research and development r d expenditures increased by  or in compared to  primarily as a result of increased tooling costs as well as the effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of costs in swiss francs into us dollars 

table of contents r d expenditures decreased by  or in compared to this decrease was the result of lower staff costs  partly due to the sale of the hasler business 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in tooling costs and by the effect of higher foreign exchange rates a weaker us dollar 
r d expense as a percent of total revenues was in  in and in there is no significant r d expense associated with the penn crusher and jeffrey businesses 
interest expense increased by  or in as compared to this increase was largely the result of adding  of acquisition debt for penn crusher in january plus  to a much lesser degree  foreign exchange rates a weaker us dollar applicable to interest paid in other currencies 
further information regarding the penn crusher acquisition debt is presented in the liquidity and capital resources section of this item the increased interest expense was somewhat offset by lower interest rates in on the non penn crusher related debt compared with interest rates and by debt reductions of  in switzerland  at the foreign exchange rate at the end of and  in the united states 
interest expense decreased by  or in versus this decrease was due to lower interest rates and debt reductions of  in switzerland  at constant foreign exchange rates and  in the united states  which was partially offset by higher foreign exchange rates a weaker us dollar 
interest expense as a percent of total revenues was in  in and in income before income taxes was  in   in and  in the changes during the periods were the result of the items discussed above 
the income before income taxes improved versus primarily as a result of acquiring penn crusher  and the income before income taxes improved versus  despite lower revenues in  primarily as a result of the hasler heavy feeder business sale on july  and the benefits of the globalization and cost reduction initiatives which we implemented during the latter half of the  and provisions for income tax of   and  respectively  related primarily to our higher proportion of us income before tax in  results in the united states and switzerland in and results in the united states and germany in the effective tax rates were in  in and in the higher effective tax rate in compared with was primarily due to the acquisition of penn crusher and the resulting higher proportion of us income 
the higher effective tax rate in compared with was primarily due to an increase in foreign taxable income in as compared to  which included a loss in both switzerland and germany on the sale of the hasler business 
on july   new jersey approved legislation for corporation income tax reform 
the changes made to the law accounted for an increase in the tax provision for and of approximately  and  respectively  after the related federal income tax benefit 
we have foreign and us state tax loss carryforwards that total  and  respectively  which  if realized  would have an estimated future net income benefit of approximately  and  respectively 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations during the last three years 
our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates increased by  or at the end of compared with year end  from  to  of this increase  
table of contents  was attributable to the addition of the penn crusher and jeffrey businesses 
the remaining portion of the backlog increase was largely due to the emea asia feeder business 
the majority of the backlog at the end of consisted of orders that were expected to be shipped within days 
approximately  of the penn crusher backlog at the end of was for blanket orders that can be placed by the customer at any time over an month period 
our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates decreased by  or at the end of compared to due to the very weak capital equipment spending environment that existed during all of  and it reflected fewer orders for feeding equipment 
liquidity and capital resources penn crusher acquisition debt to finance the penn crusher acquisition described earlier  we borrowed  from two us banks  and we also issued  in unsecured promissory notes to the penn crusher stockholders 
we borrowed  from a us bank through the us manufacturing subsidiary for the k tron feeder group  which loan was combined with an outstanding term loan from that bank to that subsidiary and resulted in a new  term loan 
monthly principal payments of  plus interest at a fixed rate of on approximately half the loan and at a variable rate of one month libor plus on the other half at january  began in february  with the final principal payment of approximately  plus interest being due in january this loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the us manufacturing subsidiary and is guaranteed by k tron international  inc at january   there was  outstanding under the term loan facility 
the term loan facility requires that k tron international comply with certain covenants relating to the consolidated debt to net worth ratio  minimum annual debt coverage and minimum net worth 
at january   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
penn crusher borrowed  from another us bank consisting of an aggregate of  term debt  with a five year term and  with a six year term and  under a five year revolving credit facility 
subject to certain conditions  the revolving credit facility provides for up to  of total availability  including the  originally borrowed thereunder 
no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of january  quarterly term debt principal payments of  began march  and increase each year by  per quarter or  per year in the aggregate through december   with final quarterly principal payments of  in interest is based on one to six month libor plus to  and the to can be reduced to to upon meeting certain financial ratios 
as of january   there was  outstanding on the five year term loan and  outstanding on the six year term loan 
in january  penn crusher entered into an interest rate swap related to the entire  five year term loan such that interest will not exceed for the full term of the loan and can be reduced to upon meeting certain financial ratios 
the interest rates on the  term loan and the  term loan were and  respectively  as of january  the penn crusher debt is guaranteed by jeffrey and secured by substantially all of the assets of penn crusher and jeffrey  but it is not guaranteed by any other k tron company except by a non recourse pledge of the stock of penn crusher 
the term loans and revolving credit facility require that penn crusher comply with certain covenants relating to tangible net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio and total debt to ebitda ratio 
at january   penn crusher was in compliance with these covenants 

table of contents in addition  k tron international issued  of unsecured promissory notes to the former penn crusher stockholders as part of the penn crusher purchase price 
these notes are payable in three equal  annual installments on the second  third and fourth anniversaries of the january  closing date 
interest at per annum is payable quarterly 
the first principal payout of  is due on january  as stated previously  k tron and penn crusher expect to have sufficient cash flow to cover all required principal and interest payments on the foregoing debt 
other bank debt at january   our swiss subsidiary had separate credit facilities totaling  swiss francs approximately  with three swiss banks 
the company s real property in switzerland is pledged as collateral 
as of january   there were outstanding borrowings of  swiss francs approximately  with  swiss francs approximately  available for new borrowings  letters of credit and customer guarantees 
the annual interest rates on the outstanding borrowings range from to 
in june  the us manufacturing subsidiary for the k tron feeder group refinanced its year mortgage debt with a us bank for  at an annual interest rate of 
in july  the annual interest rate was reduced to and  beginning august   this loan became repayable in eighty three monthly principal and interest payments of  each  with a final payment of  plus interest due on august  as of january   the principal amount owed on this borrowing was also in june  this same us manufacturing subsidiary entered into a two year secured revolving credit facility with the us bank that holds the mortgage

total debt decreased by  in  of total net debt repayments offset in part by an  increase due to the effect of a weaker us dollar on the translation of our foreign debt 
other items at the end of and  our working capital was  and  respectively  and the ratio of our current assets to our current liabilities was and  respectively 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to the acquisition of penn crusher 
the reduction in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was primarily the result of the current portion of long term debt associated with the penn crusher purchase 
in and  we utilized internally generated funds to meet our working capital needs  and in we also utilized our lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in   in and  in we reduced receivables and inventory significantly in in  we also achieved reductions that were partly offset by increases due to a higher level of business in the last quarter of therefore  operating cash flow was slightly lower in than in the increase in operating cash flow in versus was primarily due to higher net income and the positive effects on working capital of the july  sale of our hasler heavy feeder business 
net income and depreciation and amortization were the principal components of cash provided by operating activities in all three years

spending on the erp system implementation was essentially complete as of january   and a majority of the spending on the crm was also complete on that date 
funds used in to acquire penn crusher were  funds used in to acquire pcs were  while funds received from the sale of the hasler heavy feeder business and the swiss machine and welding shops were  cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the  borrowed to finance the penn crusher acquisition  net of debt reduction 
cash used in financing activities in was for debt reduction  while in cash was used primarily for debt reduction and the purchase of  shares of our common stock 
cash and short term investments increased to  at the end of versus  at the end of and  at the end of shareholders equity increased  in  of which  was attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates weaker us dollar  particularly with respect to the swiss franc and euro  while changes in foreign exchange rates caused a translation increase in shareholders equity of  in and a  decrease in forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf
