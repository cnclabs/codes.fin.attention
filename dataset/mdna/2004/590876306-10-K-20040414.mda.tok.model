critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following 
index the company s revenues are generally recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated and amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes accounting principles board apb no  intangible assets  effective february   the company s unamortized goodwill balance is not being amortized over its estimated useful life  rather  it is being assessed at least annually for impairment 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense 
forward looking statements  factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risk 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these forward looking statements may be identified by words describing our belief or expectation  such as where we say that we believe  expect or anticipate  or where we characterize something in a manner in which there is an express or implicit reference to the future  such as non recurring or unusual 
the content of the other statements may indicate that the statement is forward looking

the following important factors  along with those discussed elsewhere in this annual report of form k  could affect future results and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements the write down of costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill  as a result of the determination that the acquired business is impaired 
our flex kleen division  which initially performed well after being acquired by met pro  has experienced declining performance during the last several years due primarily to a general weakness in its served markets

however  if flex kleen s performance does not improve sufficiently in the current fiscal year  we may be required to write off some or all of the goodwill  materially adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by us or in significant customers of ours  material changes in available technology  changes in our accounting rules promulgated by regulatory agencies  including the sec  which could result in an impact on earnings  unexpected results in our product development activities  loss of key customers  changes in product mix  changes in our existing management  exchange rate fluctuations  changes in federal  state laws and regulations  lower than anticipated return on investments in the company s defined benefit plans  which could affect the amount of the company s pension liabilities  the assertion of litigation claims that the company s products  including products produced by companies acquired by the company  infringe third party patents or have caused injury  loss or damage  adverse developments in the asbestos cases that have been filed against the company  including without limitations adverse developments in the availability of insurance coverage in these cases  the effect of acquisitions and other strategic ventures  failure to properly quote and or execute customer orders  including misspecifications  design  engineering or production errors
