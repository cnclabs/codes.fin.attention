overview we are a fully integrated  self administered  publicly traded real estate investment trust which owns  develops  acquires  manages and leases community shopping centers  single tenant retail properties and one 
table of contents regional mall  in the midwestern  southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
at december   our portfolio consist of shopping centers  of which ten are power centers and three are single tenant properties  as well as one enclosed regional mall  totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area 
our corporate strategy is to maximize total return for our shareholders by improving operating income and enhancing asset value 
we pursue our goal through a proactive approach to redeveloping  renovating and expanding our shopping centers 
the acquisition of community shopping centers  with a focus on grocery and nationally recognized discount department store anchor tenants 
the development of new shopping centers in metropolitan markets where we believe demand for a center exists 
a proactive approach to leasing vacant spaces and entering into new leases for occupied spaces where leases are about to expire 
we have followed a disciplined approach to managing our operations by focusing primarily on enhancing the value of our existing portfolio through strategic sales and successful leasing efforts and by improving our capital structure through the refinancing of a portion of our variable rate debt with long term fixed rate debt and two stock offerings 
we continue to selectively pursue new acquisitions and development opportunities 
the highlights of our activity reflect this strategy we acquired six properties at an aggregate cost of million 
we completed a number of redevelopments projects  including phase i of the repositioning of the tel twelve shopping center in southfield  michigan for a total cost of approximately million 
phase ii of the redevelopment is currently underway for an estimated net cost of approximately million 
the strength of our portfolio supplemented with acquisitions brought on line since january  allowed us to increase our total revenue by in during  we opened new non anchor stores  at an average base rent of per square foot  which represents a increase above our portfolio average 
we also renewed non anchor leases at an average base rent of  achieving an increase of over prior rental rates 
in addition  we signed new anchor leases during our occupancy for the portfolio was as of december  we repaid two floating rate mortgages totaling million and replaced them with fixed rate mortgages amounting to million with interest rates of and 
in addition  we refinanced a shopping center that was previously included as part of our borrowings under our secured credit facility 
this new mortgage in the amount of million has a fixed rate interest rate 
in june  we issued  common shares of beneficial interest in a public offering 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our two credit facilities and partially finance two acquisitions 
in october  we had a second public offering 
we issued  common shares of beneficial interest with a total net proceeds of million that were used to pay down outstanding balances under our secured and unsecured credit facilities and invest in short term investments critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
it is our opinion that we fully disclose our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
consistent with our 
table of contents disclosure policies we include the following discussion related to what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgment reserve for bad debts we provide for bad debt expense based upon the reserve method of accounting 
we continuously monitor the collectibility of our accounts receivable billed  unbilled and straight line from specific tenants  analyze historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in tenant payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
when tenants are in bankruptcy  we make estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year 
management believes the allowance is adequate to absorb currently estimated bad debts 
however  if we experience bad debts in excess of the reserves we have established  our operating income would be reduced 
real estate we record real estate assets at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
direct costs incurred for the acquisition  development and construction of properties are capitalized 
for redevelopment of an existing operating property  the undepreciated net book value plus the direct costs for the construction including demolition costs incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent such costs do not exceed the estimated fair value when complete 
to the extent such costs exceed the estimated fair value of such property  the excess would be charged to expense 
other assets other assets consist primarily of prepaid expenses  proposed development and acquisition costs  and financing and leasing costs which are amortized using the straight line method over the terms of the respective agreements 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the leasing costs is charged to expense 
unamortized financing costs are expensed when the related agreements are terminated before their scheduled maturity dates 
proposed development and acquisition costs are deferred and transferred to construction in progress when development commences or written off to expense if development is not considered probable 
purchase accounting for acquisitions of real estate and other assets amounts allocated to land and buildings are based on cost segregation studies performed by management s analysis of comparable properties in the existing portfolio 
the estimated fair value of above market and below market in place leases for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the aggregate fair value of other intangible assets consisting of in place  at market leases is estimated based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize independent appraisals or management s estimates to determine the respective property values 
management s estimates of property values are made using internally developed methods 
factors considered by management in their analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases 
the fair value of above market in place leases and the fair value of other intangible assets acquired are recorded as identified intangible assets  included in other assets  and are amortized as reductions of rental revenue over the initial term of the respective leases 
the fair value of below market in place leases are recorded as deferred credits and are amortized as additions to rental income over the initial terms of the respective leases 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value would be written off 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas requires an impairment loss to be recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
this statement requires the use of one of two present value techniques to measure the fair value of an asset 
using our best estimates based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  we review for impairment long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
table of contents that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
in addition  this statement requires us to account for the sale of shopping centers in discontinued operations and not as part of our ongoing operations 
we evaluate the recoverability of our investment in real estate whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
our assessment of recoverability of our real estate assets includes  but is not limited to  recent operating results  expected net operating cash flow and our plans for future operations 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in value of other assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our consolidated financial statements if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets might not be recoverable 
for the years ended  december   and  none of our assets were considered impaired 
revenue recognition shopping center space is generally leased to retail tenants under leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
we recognize minimum rents on the straight line method over the terms of the leases  as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
certain of the leases also provide for additional revenue based on contingent percentage income which is recorded on an accrual basis once the specified target that triggers this type of income is achieved 
the leases also typically provide for tenant recoveries of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
revenues from fees and management income are recognized in the period in which the services occur 
lease termination fees are recognized when a lease termination agreement is executed by the parties 
straight line rental income was greater than the current amount required to be paid by our tenants by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable include unbilled straight line rent receivables of million at december  and million at december  off balance sheet arrangements we have five off balance sheet investments in which we own or less of the total ownership interests 
with the exception of plc novi west development  llc  we provide leasing  development and property management services to the joint ventures 
these investments are accounted for under the equity method 
in our judgment  we do not have the level of control of these joint ventures to include the entities as consolidated subsidiaries

in january  we were informed that the michigan supreme court elected not to review the appellate courts decision that overturned a favorable lower court ruling in favor of a taxpayer 
since we previously paid the additional tax for the above mentioned years and filed a protective claim requesting a refund  we recorded a receivable from the state of michigan

financing activities the acquisitions  developments and redevelopments  including expansion and renovation programs  that we made during generally were financed though cash provided from operating activities  revolving credit facilities  refinancing mortgages  a construction loan  assumption of four mortgages as a result of acquisitions and two equity offerings 
total debt outstanding was approximately million as compared to million at december  and  respectively 
in  the increase in our debt was due primarily to the funding of acquisitions  development and expansion activity

liquidity and capital resources our capital structure at december   includes property specific mortgages  our unsecured revolving credit facility  our secured revolving credit facility  our series b preferred shares  our common shares and a minority interest in the operating partnership 
the principal uses of our liquidity and capital resources are for operations  acquisitions  developments  redevelopments  including expansion and renovation programs and debt repayment  as well as dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements 
we anticipate that cash on hand  borrowings under our existing credit facilities  as well as other debt and additional equity offerings  will provide the necessary capital to achieve continued growth 
the following is a summary of our cash flow activities dollars in thousands year ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities to maintain our qualification as a reit under the code  we are required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our real estate investment trust taxable income as defined in the code

our million secured revolving credit facility bears interest between and basis points over libor depending on certain of our leverage ratios 
using basis points over libor at december   the effective interest resulted in an effective interest rate was  including interest rate swap agreements 
at our option  through june  we can increase the available amount of borrowings from million to million  upon payment of a fee to the lenders and provided that we are not then in 
table of contents default 
a portion of the proceeds from our two equity offerings in were used to pay down the outstanding balance under our secured revolving credit facility

at december   we also had other letters of credit outstanding of approximating million related to redevelopment and leasing activity 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under any of our letters of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with all loan covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with all loan covenants 
if we were to violate these covenants  we may be subject to higher finance costs and fees 
foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
under terms of various debt agreements  we are required to maintain interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rate on our floating rate debt 
we have interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  based on rates in effect at december   the agreements provide for fixed rates ranging from to at libor plus basis points and expire at various dates through december we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counter party to the interest rate swap agreements  however we do not anticipate non performance by the counter party 
after taking into account the impact of converting our variable rate debt into fixed rate debt by use of the interest rate swap agreements  at december   our variable rate debt accounted for approximately million of outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
variable rate debt accounted for approximately of our total debt and of our total market capitalization 
the properties in which ramco gershenson properties  lp the operating partnership  owns an interest but do not have financial or operating control of  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  are subject to non recourse mortgage indebtedness 
at december   our unconsolidated joint venture entities had million of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of  of which million was our proportionate share 
the mortgage loans other than our secured revolving credit facility encumbering our properties  including properties held by our unconsolidated joint ventures  are generally non recourse  subject to certain exceptions for which we would be liable for any resulting losses incurred by the lender 
these exceptions vary from loan to loan but generally include fraud or a material misrepresentation  misstatement or omission by the borrower  intentional or grossly negligent conduct by the borrower that harms the property or results in a loss to the lender  filing of bankruptcy petition by the borrower  either directly or indirectly  and certain environmental liabilities 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain of such events  such as fraud or filing of a bankruptcy petition by the borrower  we would be liable for the entire outstanding balance of the loan  all interest accrued thereon and certain other costs  penalties and expenses 

table of contents contractual obligations the following are our contractual cash obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years mortgages and notes payable employment contracts operating lease unconditional construction cost obligations total contractual cash obligations mortgages and notes payable see analysis of debt included in the financing activities section above 
employment contracts we have employment contracts with various officers 
see our definitive proxy statement to be filed with the securities and exchange commission within days after the year covered by this annual report for a discussion of these agreements 
operating lease we lease office space for our corporate headquarters under an operating lease that expires on june  we are currently negotiating a long term operating lease for our corporate office needs 
we expect that the rent under the new lease agreement will increase our annual rent expense by approximately  construction costs in connection with the development and expansion of various shopping centers as of december   we have entered into agreements for construction costs of approximately million 
capitalization our capital structure at december   includes property specific mortgages  our unsecured revolving credit facility  our secured revolving credit facility  our series b preferred shares  our common shares and the minority interest in the operating partnership 
at december   the minority interest in the operating partnership represented a ownership in the operating partnership which  may under certain conditions  be exchanged for an aggregate of  common shares 
as of december   the units in the operating partnership units op units were exchangeable for common shares of the company on a one for one basis 
we  as sole general partner of the operating partnership  have the option  but not the obligation  to settle exchanged op units in cash based on the current trading price of our common shares 
assuming the exchange of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership  there would have been  of our common shares outstanding at december   with a market value of approximately million based on the closing price of per share on december  
as part of our business plan to improve our capital structure and reduce debt  we will continue to pursue the strategy of selling fully valued properties and to dispose of shopping centers that no longer meet the criteria established for our portfolio 
our ability to obtain acceptable selling prices and satisfactory terms will impact the timing of future sales 
net proceeds from the sale of properties are expected to reduce outstanding debt 

table of contents we anticipate that the combination of the availability under the secured revolving credit facility  the unsecured revolving credit facility  possible equity offerings  the sale of existing properties  and potential new debt will satisfy our expected working capital requirements through at least the next months 
we anticipate adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future to fund future developments  expansions  repositionings  and to continue currently planned capital programs  and to make distributions to our shareholders in accordance with the code s requirements applicable to reits 
although we believe that the combination of factors discussed above will provide sufficient liquidity  no such assurance can be given 
economic conditions the retail industry has experienced some financial difficulties during the past few years and certain local  regional and national retailers have filed for protection under bankruptcy laws 
if this trend should continue  and includes tenants in our portfolio  our future earnings performance could be negatively impacted 
sensitivity analysis we are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate debt obligations 
we are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or other material market rate or price risks 
based on our debt and interest rates and the interest rate swap agreements in effect at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease or increase of our annual earnings and cash flows by approximately  under terms of various debt agreements  we are required to maintain interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rate on our floating rate debt 
we have seven interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  based on rates in effect at december   the agreements provide for fixed rates ranging from to at libor plus basis points and expire at various dates through december we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counter party to the interest rate swap agreements  however we do not anticipate non performance by the counter party 
risks related to our business adverse market conditions and tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our revenues 
the economic performance and value of our real estate assets are subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate  including risks related to adverse changes in national  regional and local economic and market conditions 
our current properties are located in states in the midwestern  southeastern and mid atlantic regions of the united states 
the economic condition of each of our markets may be dependent on one or more industries 
an economic downturn in one of these industries may result in a business downturn for our tenants  and as a result  these tenants may fail to make rental payments  decline to extend leases upon expiration  delay lease commencements or declare bankruptcy 
any tenant bankruptcies  leasing delays  or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant s lease  causing material losses to us and adversely impacting our operating results 
if our properties do not generate sufficient income to meet our operating expenses  including future debt service  our income and results of operations would be adversely affected 
kmart corporation filed for chapter bankruptcy protection during january in june  kmart corporation assigned its lease at our tel twelve shopping center to meijer  inc  a discount department and grocery store retailer 
the assignment of this lease was accounted for as a lease termination and we wrote off the straight line rent receivable of approximately million  with a corresponding charge to other operating expenses 
any bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant  the lease guarantor or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the 
table of contents lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims 
it is possible that we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold  if at all  which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
if any of our anchor tenants becomes insolvent  suffers a downturn in business  or decides not to renew its lease or vacates a property and prevents us from re letting that property by continuing to pay rent for the balance of the term  it may adversely impact our business 
in addition  a lease termination by an anchor tenant or a failure of an anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by some of our non anchor tenants in the same shopping center pursuant to the terms of their leases 
in that event  we may be unable to re let the vacated space 
similarly  the leases of some anchor tenants may permit them to transfer their leases to other retailers 
the transfer to a new anchor tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease  which would reduce the income generated by that retail center 
in addition  a transfer of a lease to a new anchor tenant could also give other tenants the right to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases with us 
concentration of our credit risk could reduce our operating results 
several of our tenants represent a significant portion of our leasing revenues 
as of december   we received of our annualized rent from wal mart stores  inc seven other tenants each represented at least of our total annualized base rent 
the concentration in our leasing revenue from a small number of tenants creates the risk that  should these tenants experience financial difficulties  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we are involved in various tax disputes with the internal revenue service and may not be able to resolve these disputes on satisfactory terms 
the irs is currently conducting an examination irs examination of us for the taxable years ended december  and  and of one of our subsidiary partnerships for the taxable years ended december    and as of december   the irs has not issued a report nor proposed any adjustments in connection with the irs examination 
certain tax deficiencies and any related interest and penalties which may be assessed against us in connection with the irs examination may constitute covered taxes under an agreement we entered into with atlantic realty trust atlantic 
atlantic may not have sufficient assets to reimburse us for all amounts we must pay to the irs with respect to such covered taxes  and we would be required to pay the difference out of our own funds 
the irs may also assess taxes that atlantic is not required to pay 
accordingly  the ultimate resolution of any controversy over tax liabilities arising pursuant to the irs examination may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  including if we are required to distribute deficiency dividends to our shareholders and or pay additional taxes  interest and penalties to the irs in amounts that atlantic cannot  is not required to  or otherwise does not pay 
our failure to qualify as a reit would result in higher taxes and reduced cash available for our shareholders 
we believe that we currently operate in a manner so as to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
if  however  we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax  including any applicable alternative minimum tax  on our taxable income at regular corporate rates  and distributions to shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income 
any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders  which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of  and trading prices for  our shares 
unless entitled to relief under certain internal revenue code provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit 

table of contents our inability to successfully identify or complete suitable acquisitions and new developments would adversely affect our results of operations integral to our business strategy is our ability to continue to acquire and develop properties 
we also may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties that meet our acquisition criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms 
we may not be successful in identifying suitable areas for new development  negotiating for the acquisition of the land  obtaining required permits and authorizations  completing developments in accordance with our budgets and on a timely basis or leasing any newly developed space 
if we fail to identify or complete suitable acquisitions or developments within our budget  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and our growth could slow  which in turn could adversely impact our share price 
our redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
a key component of our business strategy is exploring redevelopment opportunities at existing properties within our portfolio and in connection with property acquisitions 
to the extent that we engage in these redevelopment activities  they will be subject to the risks normally associated with these projects  including  among others  cost overruns and timing delays as a result of the lack of availability of materials and labor  weather conditions and other factors outside of our control 
any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these redevelopment projects and adversely impact our operating results 
funds from operations we consider funds from operations  also known as ffo  an appropriate supplemental measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
under the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition  ffo represents income before minority interest  excluding extraordinary items  as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  gains on sales of depreciable property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to gaap net income as an indication of our performance 
we consider ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing our comparative operating and financial performance between periods or to compare our performance to different reits 
however  our computation of ffo may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other real estate companies  and therefore  may not be comparable to these other real estate companies 

table of contents the following table illustrates the calculations of ffo in thousands years ended december  net income available to common shareholders add depreciation and amortization expense minority interest in partnership continuing operations discontinued operations less discontinued operations  gain on sale of property  net of minority interest gain on redemption of preferred shares gain on sale of real estate funds from operations basic add convertible preferred share dividends funds from operations diluted basic weighted average shares outstanding convertible preferred shares and stock options diluted weighted average shares outstanding supplemental disclosure straight line rental income amortization of management contracts and covenants not to compete excludes gain on sale of undepreciated land of  in  in and in series b preferred shares are not convertible into common shares 
therefore they are excluded from the calculation 
basic weighted average shares outstanding represents the weighted average total shares outstanding  which includes common shares and assumes the redemption of all operating partnership units for common shares 
diluted weighted average shares outstanding represents the basic weight average common shares outstanding plus the conversion of series a convertible preferred shares to common shares and the dilutive impact of in the money stock options 
capital expenditures during  we spent approximately million on revenue generating capital expenditures including tenant allowances  leasing commissions paid to third party brokers  legal costs relative to lease documents  and capitalized leasing and construction costs 
these types of costs generate a return through rents from tenants over the terms of their leases 
revenue enhancing capital expenditures  including expansions  renovations and repositionings were approximately million 
revenue neutral capital expenditures  such as roof and parking lot repairs  which are anticipated to be recovered from tenants  amounted to approximately million 

table of contents for the year ending december   we anticipate spending approximately million for revenue generating  revenue enhancing and revenue neutral capital expenditures 
inflation substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rent based on tenants gross sales  which usually increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the term of the leases 
a substantial number of our leases require the tenants to pay their maintenance  real estate taxes  maintenance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
