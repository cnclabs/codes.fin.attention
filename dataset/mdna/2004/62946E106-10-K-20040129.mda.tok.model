critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  short term and long term investments  deferred tax assets  income taxes  collectibility of customer receivables  long lived assets including goodwill  certain accrued expenses  and contingencies and litigation 
we believe the following reflect our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue our revenue recognition policies for ens are as follows transaction services 
healthcare payers and providers pay us fees for our services  generally on a per transaction basis or monthly basis 
we recognize revenue as we perform the service 
healthcare payers and providers also pay us one time implementation and annual maintenance fees 
we recognize revenue from these fees ratably over the term of the respective agreements 
physician services 
healthcare providers pay us one time fees for the purchase of practice management software systems 
we recognize revenue from these one time fees when we enter into noncancelable agreements with our customers  the products have been delivered and there are no uncertainties regarding product acceptance and delivery and no significant future performance obligations and collectability is probable 
amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred until we meet these criteria 
revenue from multiple element software arrangements is recognized using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  but not for all of the delivered elements 
the residual method requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair value of such elements  as indicated by vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
healthcare providers also pay us fees for maintenance and support of their practice management system  including the hardware and software 
we recognize revenue from these fees ratably over the contract period  typically in one year or less 
healthcare providers also pay us fees for transmitting transactions to payers and patients 
we recognize revenue from these fees  which are generally paid on a monthly or per transaction basis  as we provide the service 
portal service 
customers pay us for advertising  sponsorship  healthcare management tools  and e commerce transactions related to our online distribution channels and the online and offline distribution channels of our strategic partners 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered 
revenues from sponsorship arrangements and healthcare management tools are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from fixed fee content license or carriage fees is recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
e commerce revenue is recognized when a subscriber or consumer utilizes our internet based services or purchases goods or services through our web site or co branded web site with one of our strategic partners 
subscription revenue  including subscription revenue from sponsorship arrangements  is recognized over the subscription period 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values  determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and internally developed software costs 
goodwill arises from the acquisitions we have made 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determined based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill noted as a result of our impairment testing in or internally developed software the company capitalizes purchased software which is ready for service and development costs for software incurred from the time the preliminary project stage is completed until the software is ready for use 
the company capitalizes costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use when both the preliminary project state is completed and the company management has authorized further funding for the project which it deems probable will be completed and used to perform the function intended 
capitalized costs include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use software project  and interest costs incurred  when material  while developing internal use software 
capitalization of such costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose 
research and development costs and computer software maintenance costs related to software development are expensed as incurred 
capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight line method generally over four years  not to exceed the expected life of the product 
the carrying value of capitalized software development costs is regularly reviewed by the company  and a loss is recognized if the value of estimated undiscounted cash flows benefit related to the asset falls below the unamortized costs 
investments our investments at october   consist principally of an equity investment in a publicly traded company 
the company has liability for related options 
each reporting period we evaluate the market of our investments and record a corresponding gain or loss on investments 
future changes in market or economic conditions or operating results of our investments could result in gains or losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value 
the company s written call options are measured at fair value on the balance sheet with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the statement of operations

ens results of operations see note to the consolidated financial statements for segment information concerning ens 
ens fiscal year ended september  as compared to fiscal year ended september  services revenue services revenue increased from  for the fiscal year ended september  to  for the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  primarily reflecting growth in sales to providers and related payer income and revenues from new customers 
during the fiscal year ended september   ens entered into claim service agreements with pacificare and aetna and began implementations of two significant additions to an existing multi service contract which replaces the revenues lost from lifeguard and caterpillar 
while the loss in of these two large customers temporarily reduced the amount of paper claims submitted  ens has increased its number of direct e commerce connections with payers and increased its number of direct provider connections by from september  to september  cost of services cost of services increased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  as a result of increased business levels of ens and the continuing implementations of two significant additions to an existing multi service contract 
included in cost of services for the fiscal year ended september  and september  is amortization of software costs and depreciation of equipment of  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  or approximately as a result of business growth and implementations combined with cost containment measures 
this amount excludes selling and advertising in the amount of  and  and includes professional fees of  and  as of september  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  primarily due to increasing levels of fixed assets being fully depreciated during the year  because of full depreciation of certain fixed assets 
income from operations as a result of the foregoing  income from operations decreased from  for the fiscal year ended september  to  for the fiscal year ended september  interest expense interest expense  exclusive of interest payable to nwh  decreased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  or approximately in the fiscal year ended september   primarily due to a decrease in the average capital lease balances at ens during the period 
for the fiscal year ended september    of interest expense was payable by ens to nwh and was eliminated in consolidation 
ebitda ebitda decreased from  for the fiscal year ended september  to  for the fiscal year ended september  as a result of higher costs as a percent of revenue  as discussed above 
we provide ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization information as a guide to the operating performance of ens 
ebitda  which is not a term recognized under generally accepted accounting principles  is calculated as the loss income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
included in depreciation and amortization for the purpose of calculating ebitda is depreciation of equipment and amortization of software costs  which is included in cost of services 
ebitda as calculated by the company may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled items reported by other companies 
ens fiscal year ended september  as compared to fiscal year ended september  services revenue services revenue decreased from  for the fiscal year ended september  to  for the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  primarily reflecting ens reduced volumes of paper processing on all of its major contracts due primarily to the shift of providers from submitting paper claims to electronic submissions  the loss in of lifeguard and caterpillar as customers 
shifting claims from paper to e commerce reduces overall revenue as the revenue per claim for e commerce is less than paper  however  the shift from paper claims increases efficiency for both payers and providers and  for ens  generates significantly higher gross profit per claim 
while two large customers reduced the amount of paper claims submitted  ens has increased its number of direct e commerce connections with payers and increased its number of direct provider connections by from september  to september  cost of services cost of services decreased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  as a result of cost containment measures  increased electronic claim processing and reduced ads paper claims operations 
the decrease was substantially higher  in proportion  than the decrease in services revenue because of implementation of our business model  including a controlled growth program  with most of the decrease in costs concentrated in less profitable services 
included in cost of services for the fiscal year ended september  and september  is amortization of software costs and depreciation of equipment of  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expense decreased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  or approximately as a result of cost containment measures 
this amount excludes selling and advertising in the amount of  and  and includes professional fees of  and  as of september  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  due to higher levels of fixed asset purchases 
income loss from operations as a result of the foregoing  income from operations increased from a loss of  for the fiscal year ended september  to income of  for the fiscal year ended september   reflecting the full implementation of our business model  including cost containment and related reduction of less profitable lines of business 
interest expense interest expense  exclusive of interest payable to nwh  decreased from  in the fiscal year ended september  to  in the fiscal year ended september  or approximately  primarily due to a decrease in the average amount of debt outstanding at ens during the period 
capital lease obligations decreased during the period but were offset by an increase in other debt 
for the fiscal year ended september    of interest expense was payable by ens to nwh and was eliminated in consolidation 
ebitda ebitda increased from  for the fiscal year ended september  to  for the fiscal year ended september  as a result of lower costs as a percent of revenue  as discussed above 
we provide ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization information as a guide to the operating performance of ens 
ebitda  which is not a term recognized under generally accepted accounting principles  is calculated as the loss income from operations plus depreciation and amortization 
included in depreciation and amortization for the purpose of calculating ebitda is depreciation of equipment and amortization of software costs  which is included in cost of services 
ebitda as calculated by the company may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled items reported by other companies 
use of non gaap financial measures certain disclosures in this document include non gaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the consolidated statements of earnings  balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company 
as required by the sec s recently issued regulation g  a reconciliation of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization with the most directly comparable gaap measure follows ebitda we define ebitda as earnings from operations before extraordinary items  before net interest and related expenses primarily amortization of debt issuance costs  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda is income from operations 
in the discussion of ens ebitda above  the difference between ebitda and ens income from operations which does not include provision for taxes for the fiscal year ended september   and  respectively consisted primarily of  of amortization of software costs and depreciation of equipment included in costs of services and  of depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is presented as additional information because we believe it is a useful indicator of an entity s debt capacity and its ability to service its debt 
ebitda is not a substitute for operating income  net earnings or cash flows from operating activities  as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda is not a complete net cash flow measure because it is a financial performance measure that does not include reductions for cash payments for an entity s obligation to service its debt  fund its working capital and capital expenditures  and pay its income taxes 
ebitda is not a complete measure of an entity s profitability because it does not include costs and expenses for interest and income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
rather ebitda is a potential indicator of an entity s ability to fund these cash requirements 
ebitda  as we define it may differ from similarly named measures used by other entities and  consequently  could be misleading unless all entities calculate and define ebitda in the same manner 
liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities  as well as our interest in ens 
our assets have been used for  and are currently reserved to fund development of our healthcare e commerce business and development and acquisition of new technologies and businesses in other areas 
such amount  with earnings thereon including proceeds from sale of bellsouth common stock and related derivatives  is expected to be sufficient to implement this business plan through october  or for a shorter period if we determine to invest a substantial portion of our assets in major acquisitions  equity investments or stock repurchases 
we actively seek to acquire or invest in healthcare e commerce and other businesses in telecommunications  media or in unrelated areas 
we may also dispose of assets from time to time 
we have no specific arrangements with respect to any such acquisitions  dispositions or investments at the present time 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions  dispositions or investments will be made 
our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to of our common stock because we believe  under current market conditions  the repurchase is a favorable investment 
the repurchased shares will also be available for issuance upon exercise of outstanding options 
through october   we repurchased  shares for an aggregate cost of during the fiscal year ended october   we settled part of our option liabilities on bellsouth common stock 
while we continue to review our holdings of bellsouth common stock and from time to time have sold and purchased shares and derivatives of these holdings  we have not yet determined whether we will sell or hedge our remaining bellsouth securities in the near future or how we will invest the proceeds of any such transaction 
interest receivable by the company from ens remained at  at october   for a total outstanding loan to the company of  including accrued interest 
the outstanding balance under this loan agreement including interest has been eliminated from the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  the company spent  on fixed assets  including  for internally developed software and  for computer equipment required for increased claims processing and the development of xpedite  our provider targeting and tracking system 
ens has been operating profitably  allowing ens to sustain itself on cash flows from its operations without further investment from nwh 
ens liquidity and capital resources ens losses were financed principally through equity investments by the company and loans from the company  which loans aggregated  through september  including accrued interest of 
ens plans additional investment in its technology enhancements  including further development and implementation of xpedite  its full contact management operating system  its internet claims processing system  web enrollment  a remote internet based technology to enroll customers at time of sale  ect  an internet based full claims tracking system  additional payer connectivity  and enhancements to broaden the transactions processing infrastructure 
although we believe that ens may need to obtain additional financing to accelerate its strategic business plan based upon existing contracts with physicians  other providers  payers and management companies and current expense levels  management expects ens to continue profitable operations  established in the third quarter of fiscal  through fiscal inflation in the opinion of management  inflation has not had a material effect on the operations of the company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities  other than activities relating to ens and potential acquisitions  is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 
we also utilize options and short sales to protect our position in bellsouth common stock  preserve its tax basis and reduce equity price risk 
changes in prevailing interest rates and stock price of bellsouth will cause the yield on our investments and the costs of shorts and options to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities other than bellsouth common stock and related shorts and options in commercial paper  non government debt securities  money market funds  highly liquid us treasury notes and federal agency notes and other low risk investments 
we view these high grade securities within our portfolio as having similar market risk characteristics 
the weighted average interest rate of the portfolio was 
at october  currently almost all our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we conduct only limited transactions in foreign currencies  and we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant in the foreseeable future 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date
