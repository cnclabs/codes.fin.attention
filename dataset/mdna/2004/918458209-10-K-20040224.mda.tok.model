item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our annual consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the matters addressed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  with the exception of the historical information presented  contain forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under the heading risk factors following this management s discussion and analysis section  and elsewhere in this report 

table of contents overview in  the global telecommunications market  and in particular the fixed wireless broadband access market  experienced a significant downturn 
we experienced dramatic decreases in the sales of our products and the adoption of our technology in  and our sales have continued at a reduced level through while we expect that the telecommunications market may recover over time  any such recovery may occur only slowly 
if the market does not recover in the near future and if our sales do not substantially increase from current levels  we will continue to incur losses  and may never achieve profitability 
in  particularly in the later months of the year  it appeared as though the telecommunications and wireless communications industries were beginning to recover in connection with some positive announcements by major telecommunications service providers  increased capital spending by cellular operators and the growing economy in china 
in  we believed new opportunities might develop for our products and began to dedicate additional resources to sales in international markets  particularly china 
in addition to further developing our traditional wireless business  we also continue to explore alternatives relating to the license  purchase or acquisition of other products  technology  assets or businesses 
we have invested  and we expect that we will continue to invest  significant time and resources searching for and investigating new business opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully effect any of these alternatives on a timely basis or at all 
we supply broadband wireless access systems used by telecommunications service providers to deliver wireless  high speed data connections to business and residential subscribers 
we sell our systems directly to service providers  as well as to system integrators that deploy our systems as part of their end to end network solutions for service providers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
on may   vyyo acquired all of the outstanding ordinary shares of shira computers ltd 
shira  an israeli privately held company that provides software products for the prepress and publishing markets the software products segment 
due to the continuing decline in shira s sales  shira s recurring losses and its inability to penetrate the market  on august   vyyo s board of directors determined to cease all of shira s business operations and terminate all of shira s employees 
the cessation of shira s operations represents a disposal of a business segment under sfas accordingly  current period results of the software segment have been classified as discontinued operations  and prior periods have been reclassified respectively 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial conditions and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumption and conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  we determined the critical principles by considering accounting 
table of contents policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
revenues from the fixed broadband wireless segment consist primarily of product revenues 
product revenues are derived primarily from sales of hubs and modems initially sold as a package to telecommunications service providers and to system integrators 
revenues from all products and from system integration products and services are generally recorded when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and customer acceptance requirements have been met  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of payment is reasonably assured and the company has no additional obligations 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and exchanges and product warranty and liability costs upon recognition of product revenues 
emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables addresses the accounting  by a vendor  for contractual arrangements in which multiple revenue generating activities will be performed by the vendor 
it is effective prospectively for all arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  eitf issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the company adopted eitf issue in the year ended december  and it has had no impact on its financial position and results of operations 
inventory valuation 
in  due to the dramatic slowdown in the telecommunications sector and the economy in general  we recorded a write down of excess inventory and purchase commitments of million 
our estimate was based on our expectations for sales of our products in the foreseeable future due to the uncertainty of selling our existing products if and when the market recovers 
in inventory that was previously written down to by taking a charge of million  was sold for the amount of million 
restructuring expenses 
in  we implemented a restructuring program that resulted in a reduction in force of approximately of our employees and in excess facilities and equipment  and accordingly  we recorded a charge of million 
in we utilized million from the restructuring expenses and recorded a restructuring charge of million  comprised of million in compensation charges with respect to a variable compensation plan related to our former chief executive officer net of an income adjustment of  valuation of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
upon the acquisition of shira  we recorded identifiable intangible assets of  and goodwill of  we amortized the identifiable intangible assets over a period of three years 
we assessed the identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for recoverability through the estimated future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
our assessment for recoverability  based on shira s valuation as of june   resulted in impairment charges of  representing the entire carrying amount of these assets at this date  out of which  related to the acquired technology   related to the customer list   related to the goodwill recorded upon shira s acquisition and  related to property and equipment 
products warranty 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and exchanges and product warranty costs upon recognition of product revenues 
the annual provision is calculated as a percentage of the sales based on historical experience according to the obligations to customers 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated interim financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations revenues for years ended december   and revenues from the fixed broadband wireless segment include product revenues 
product revenues are derived primarily from sales of hubs and modems initially sold as a package to telecommunications service 
table of contents providers and to system integrators 
in our revenues also derived from system integration products and services provided to telecommunications service providers 
revenues from all products and from system integration products and services are generally recorded when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred and customer acceptance requirements have been met  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of payment is reasonably assured and the company has no additional obligations 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and exchanges and product warranty and liability costs upon recognition of product revenues 
we provide for warranty costs at the same time as the revenue is recognized 
the annual warranty provision is calculated as a percentage of sales based on historical experience 
emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables addresses the accounting  by a vendor  for contractual arrangements in which multiple revenue generating activities will be performed by the vendor 
it is effective prospectively for all arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  eitf issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the company adopted eitf issue in the year ended december  and it has had no impact on its financial position and results of operations 
our revenue is concentrated among relatively few customers  as shown in the table below 
though our principal revenue generating customers are likely to vary on a quarterly basis  we anticipate that our revenues will remain concentrated among a few customers for the foreseeable future 
year ended december  customer a customer b customer c customer d customer e customer f customer g represents revenues in from a settlement dispute with a customer based on a license and development agreement entered into between the company and the customer in revenues increased by in from and decreased by in from revenues were million in  million in and million in the increase in revenues in from  was primarily due to the increased shipments of our products  particularly to the china market 
the decrease in revenues in from primarily reflects the slowdown in the global economy and the telecommunications industry  reduction of capital spending and further tightening of financial markets in the telecommunication industry  which reduced the ability of our potential customers to secure financing and purchase equipment 
revenues in and in include revenues of approximately million and million  respectively  from sales of inventory that was previously written down to in as a result of the write down in  the cost of revenues associated with sales of this inventory was accounted for as cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  warranty costs  royalties in connection with israeli government incentive programs and overhead related to manufacturing our products 
cost of revenues was million in   in and million in the increase in cost of revenues  and the decrease in gross margin  in compared with  were primarily attributable to the increase in shipments of our products  our increasing workforce  purchases of new inventories made in 
table of contents response to demand for our products  and a reversal of a warranty accrual in of million as a result of warranty expiration for certain customers 
the decrease in cost of revenues  and the increase in the gross margin  in compared with were attributable primarily to decrease of the warranty liability by million as a result of warranty expiration for certain customers  charges in of approximately million for excess inventory and purchase commitments  due to the dramatic downturn in the global telecommunications industry and to the decrease in orders and sales of our products  and sales of inventories in the amount of million that were previously written down to in in  we purchased from adc telecommunications  a holder of approximately of our outstanding common stock  products and components in the amount of million 
as a result of the write down of inventories to in  cost of revenues does not include million in and million in related to the sale of such inventories 
we anticipate that our cost of revenues will increase  and our gross margin will decrease  in future periods as and to the extent that we deplete our previously written down inventories and sell products from newly acquired inventories 
while we expect that the telecommunications industry may recover over time  substantial uncertainty exists as to our ability to sell our existing products if and when the market recovers 
we have participated in several israeli government research and development incentive programs under which we received research and development participation grants of approximately million 
we are obligated to pay royalties to the granting organizations at rates that generally range from to of revenues resulting from the funded projects up to maximum amounts ranging between and  depending upon various factors  of the funded amount 
as of december   we had repaid or provided for the repayment of grants in a total amount of million 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  facilities  equipment and supplies for our research and development activities 
substantially all of our wireless research and development activities are carried out in our facility in jerusalem  israel 
these expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase in research and development expenses in compared with was due to an increase in development efforts for new wireless products and increasing our workforce 
the decrease in expenses in compared with was due to reductions in our workforce and subcontractors 
although we have recently increased our research and development expenses  as a result of the previous decreases in research and development activities  we may be unable to develop next generation products and new products to meet the demands of the market 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we increase our efforts to develop new wireless products to address the china market and other new markets 
selling and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related costs of sales and marketing employees  consulting fees and expenses for travel  trade shows and promotional activities 
sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase in sales and marketing expenses in compared with was due to an increase in sales efforts for our wireless products in china and other new markets  including expenses from a marketing agreement with one of our chinese oem customers amounting to  and increasing our workforce 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in compared with was primarily due to changes in the number of sales and marketing personnel and the level of our participation in trade shows and other promotional activities 
in and  we reduced our expenses in response to the significant downturn in the global telecommunications industry and the decrease in orders for and sales of our products 
as part of this reduction in expenses  we effected a reduction in our sales and marketing workforce in the first quarter of and in the second and third quarters of in connection with this reduction in the first quarter of  we incurred a one time charge of approximately  we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we increase our efforts to sell our products in china and other new markets 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  strategic and business development  human resources and legal 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared with was primarily due to a decrease in travel expenses  a decrease in insurances expenses and charges for stock compensation of approximately  recorded in compared with  recorded in the decrease was partially offset by an increase in professional fees in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared with was primarily due to reduction in compensation related expenses and reductions in our workforce in the second and third quarters of the decrease was partially offset by an increase in directors and officers insurance costs and a one time charge of approximately  for severance costs 
general and administrative expenses also included expenses of  in   in and  in  paid to an unaffiliated third party management company in connection with several charters of an aircraft for business travel purposes 
while we chartered the aircraft directly from the management company  the chartered aircraft is leased by harmony management  inc  of which davidi gilo and a trust for his benefit are the sole shareholders 
payments made by us to the management company for the aircraft charters were ultimately paid to harmony management  after deductions for certain operating costs and charter management fees 
harmony management has advised us that the hourly rate charged by the management company for these charters was substantially less than the standard rate charged for similar charters to other unaffiliated parties 
restructuring charges in  we implemented a restructuring program to reduce operating expenses due to the dramatic and continuing slowdown in the telecommunications sector and the general economy 
in connection with this restructuring  we recorded charges of million in these charges are costs related to excess facilities  abandoned equipment and employees severance and other related benefits 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately employees  or approximately of our workforce 
in we utilized million from the restructuring expenses and recorded a restructuring charge of million  comprised of million in compensation charges with respect to a variable compensation plan related to our former chief executive officer net of an income adjustment of  the restructuring utilizations are summarized as follows balance as of december  utilized reversal balance as of december  utilized reversal balance as of december  in thousands facilities employees severance and other related benefits interest income  net interest income  net  includes interest and investment income  foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses 
net interest income decreased to million in from million and decreased to million in from million in our interest income is derived mainly from our cash and cash equivalents and short term investment balances from proceeds from our initial and follow on public offerings effected in we expect that our interest income will continue to decrease due to decreasing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances and low interest rates in financial markets 

table of contents income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of israeli net operating loss carryforwards from our israeli subsidiary  million of united states federal net operating loss carryforwards  and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
the israeli net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date and have not been recorded as tax assets because the losses are expected to be utilized during a tax exempt period 
the united states federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in various amounts between the years and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire in various amounts between the years and we have provided a full valuation allowance against our united states federal and state deferred tax assets as the future realization of the tax benefit is not sufficiently assured 
charge for stock based compensation charge for stock compensation represents the amortization of deferred compensation charges which are based on the aggregate differences between the respective exercise price of stock options and purchase price of stock at their dates of grant or sale and the deemed fair market value of our common stock for accounting purposes  as well as stock compensation charges incurred in connection with modifications of stock awards in deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options 
charges related to stock compensation were million in  associated with separation agreements and option grant agreements related to a variable accounting plan 
amortization and charges related to stock compensation were  in including a charge of  associated with separation agreements with two of our employees net of a decrease in compensation of  related to a variable accounting plan in the first quarter of  and million in including a charge of million associated with a separation agreement with our former chief executive officer recorded as a restructuring cost 
discontinued operations a on may   we acquired all of the outstanding ordinary shares of shira computers ltd 
shira  an israeli privately held company that provides software products for the prepress and publishing markets the software products segment  pursuant to a share exchange agreement 
according to the agreement  the company issued an aggregate of  shares of the vyyo s common stock which were valued at approximately  the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method under sfas no 
the purchase price was allocated to those assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value of those assets and liabilities as of june  the acquisition date 
identifiable intangible assets consist of acquired technology in the amount of  and customer list in the amount of  goodwill of  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill  which is related to software products  is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually 
the results of shira s operations were consolidated from july  due to the continuing decline in shira s sales  shira s recurring losses and its inability to penetrate the market  the vyyo s board of directors determined on august   to cease all of shira s business operations and terminate all of shira s employees 
the cessation of shira s operations represents a disposal of a business segment under sfas accordingly  current period results of operations of the software segment have been classified as discontinued operations  and prior periods results have been reclassified respectively 

table of contents assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations were as follows december  in thousands current assets property and equipment  net goodwill identifiable intangible assets current liabilities as of december   current liabilities include a provision for severance pay expenses and termination of contractual obligations in the amount of  which is expected to be paid in the first quarter of losses of the discontinued operations were as follows year ended december in thousands revenues cost of revenues gross loss loss from operations interest expenses  net net loss from discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations includes amortization of intangible assets we amortized the identifiable intangible assets over a period of three years

table of contents impairment of goodwill and intangible assets due to the continuing decline in shira s sales  shira s recurring losses and its inability to penetrate the market  we performed an impairment test  based on the valuation of shira s operations and its tangible and intangible assets as of june  the impairment test resulted in impairment charges of  out of which  related to the acquired technology   related to the customer list   related to the goodwill recorded upon shira s acquisition and  related to property and equipment 
the impairment charges were based on the fair value of the related assets  which were calculated based on the present value of the related cash flows

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
under fin  entities are separated into two categories those for which voting interests are used to determine consolidation this is the most common classification and those for which variable interests are used to determine consolidation 
fin explains how to identify variable interest entities vie s and how to determine when a public company should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
since issuing fin  the fasb has proposed various amendments to the interpretation and has deferred its effective dates 
most recently  in december  the fasb issued a revised version of fin fin r  which also provides for a partial deferral of fin this partial deferral established the effective dates for the application of fin and fin r based on the nature of the vie and the date upon which the public company became involved with the vie 
in general  the deferral provides that i for vies created before february   a public company must apply fin r at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after march   and may be required to apply fin at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december   if the vie is a special purpose entity  and ii for vies created after january   a public company must apply fin at the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december   as previously required  and then apply fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  we currently have no variable interests in any vie 
accordingly  we believe that the adoption of fin and fin r will not have material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
 and  and a revision of fasb statement no 
fas revised 
this statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans 
the new rules require additional disclosures about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans 

table of contents part of the new disclosures provisions are effective for calendar year end financial statements  but have no impact on the company s financial statements 
the rest of the provisions of this statement  which have a later effective date  are currently being evaluated by the company 
interim financial statements the following table presents unaudited quarterly financial information for each of the four quarters in the year ended december  you should read this information in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
quarter ended december september june march in thousands  except per share data statements of operations data revenues gross profit operating loss net loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net loss net gain loss per share basic and diluted continuing operations discontinued operations net loss per share basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in thousands basic and diluted liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have funded operations primarily through equity sales and borrowings from stockholders and banks 
we raised approximately million in in convertible debt from stockholders and equity 
we raised approximately million in from the issuance of common stock  most of which was raised in our initial public offering in april and our follow on offering in september as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
in  net cash used in operations was million  comprised of our net loss of million  changes in other working capital accounts of million  and capital gain of  partially offset by non cash charges of a depreciation and amortization of million  b impairment of identifiable intangible assets  property and equipment  as well as goodwill  of million  and c charge related to stock compensation of million

in  net cash provided by investing activities was million  comprised of our proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments net of our purchase of short term investments of million as well as proceeds from sale of property and equipment amounting to approximately  partially offset by an outflow of approximately  for investments in property and equipment and approximately  from the acquisition of shira 

table of contents financing activities in amounted to approximately million of proceeds from exercises of options and purchases of stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities in resulted in a net outflow of approximately million from a loan to our former chief executive officer in the amount of million and from proceeds from short term debt of approximately  partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases of stock under the employee stock purchase plan of approximately  on december   we announced a stock repurchase program of up to  shares subject to market conditions and at the discretion of management 
as of december   through open market transactions  we repurchased  shares under the repurchase program for a total of million 
we did not repurchase any shares under the repurchase program in or our liquidity will be impacted to some extent by the amount of share repurchases  if any  made under the repurchase program in the future 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of establishing additional international operations and other factors 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to cancel or suspend our stock repurchase program  sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to search for  investigate and  potentially  acquire new businesses  companies or technologies 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations our known contractual obligations for the fiscal year ended december  are as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total effective corporate tax rates our tax rate will reflect a mix of the united states federal and state tax on our united states income and israeli tax on non exempt income 
our israeli subsidiary the subsidiary has been granted approved enterprise status for several investment programs 
these programs entitle the israeli subsidiary to tax exemption periods from two to six years on undistributed earnings derived from an approved enterprise  commencing in the year in which it attains taxable income and a reduced corporate tax rate of for the remaining term of the program on the plan s proportionate share of income 
since the subsidiary has not achieved taxable income  the tax benefits periods has not yet commenced 
the subsidiary s losses are expected to offset certain future earnings of the subsidiary during the tax exempt period 
therefore  the utilization of the net operating losses will generate no tax benefits 
on january   the israeli law for amendment of the income tax ordinance amendment no 
  as amended  known as the tax reform  came into effect 
the tax reform is aimed at broadening the categories of taxable income and reducing the tax rates imposed on employment income 
pursuant to these reforms  we have chosen  with respect to stock options granted under vyyo inc s second amended and restated 
table of contents employee and consultant equity incentive plan the plan  to grant to employees and office holders nosei missra of our subsidiary who are israeli tax residents  in each case excluding controlling shareholders as such term is defined in section of the israeli income tax ordinance  options without a trustee intermediary 
this permits such employees and office holders  pursuant to the terms of the plan  to exercise their stock options and sell their shares without the holding period requirements and other restrictions imposed in the case of options granted through a trustee intermediary 
in the absence of a trustee intermediary  the tax reform generally permits such employees and office holders to recognize ordinary income at the time the employee actually sells the shares  rather than on the date of grant or exercise  but precludes us from deducting the resulting expense for tax purposes at any time 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements concerning our existing and future products  markets  expenses  revenues  liquidity  performance and cash needs as well as our plans and strategies 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are based on current management expectations 
many factors could cause actual results and events to differ significantly from the results anticipated by us and described in these forward looking statements  including but not limited to the following risk factors 
we have a history of losses  expect future losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
in response to the significant decline in our business and revenues which began in and has continued through the present  we have decreased our operating expenses in our wireless business  however  our expenses will continue to be significantly greater than our gross margin on revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we recently increased our sales and marketing expenditures and research and development expenditures in connection with our increased efforts in china 
our revenues and gross margins may not grow or even continue at their current level and may decline even further 
our gross margins have been favorably affected by sales of inventory that had been previously written off 
if our revenues do not rapidly increase  or if our expenses increase at a greater pace than our revenues  we will never become profitable 
economic weakness has adversely affected  and could continue to affect adversely  our revenues  gross margin and expenses 
our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for fixed wireless broadband access systems 
weak demand for our products and services caused by ongoing economic weakness over the past several years has resulted  and may result  in decreased revenue  gross margin  earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and realize customer receivables 
economic and market conditions continue to be challenging 
as a result  individuals and companies have delayed or reduced expenditures  including those for technology 
in addition  if our customers experience financial difficulties  we could experience increases in bad debt write offs and additions to reserves in our receivables portfolio  our lessees may be unable to make required payments 
continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
further delays or reductions in broadband wireless technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations  prospects and stock price 
if the adoption of broadband wireless technology continues to be limited  we will not be able to sustain our business 
our future success in the telecommunications business depends on high speed wireless communications products gaining market acceptance as a means to provide voice and data communications services 
because these markets are relatively new and unproven  it is difficult to predict if these markets will ever develop or 
table of contents expand 
the major service providers in the united states  including worldcom  which is currently in chapter reorganization proceedings  and sprint have ceased  delayed or reduced their rollouts and may further delay or reduce rollouts in the future 
in the event that service providers adopt technologies other than the wireless technologies that we offer or if they delay further their deployment of high speed wireless communication products  we will not be able to sustain or expand our business 
if telecommunications service providers and systems integrators do not promote and purchase our products  or if the telecommunications equipment market continues not to improve and grow  our business will seriously be harmed 
telecommunications service providers continually evaluate alternative technologies  including digital subscriber line  fiber and cable 
should service providers or systems integrators  to which we may sell products in the future  cease to emphasize systems that include our products  choose to emphasize alternative technologies or promote systems of our competitors  our business would be seriously harmed 
in addition  commencing in and continuing through  the market for telecommunications equipment significantly declined  which severely adversely affected the entire telecommunications industry  including service providers  systems integrators and equipment providers  and reduced the business outlook and visibility of the industry 
in connection with the deterioration of global economic conditions  many of our customers and potential customers are also currently unable to obtain debt or equity financing for deployment of their wireless access networks and therefore do not currently have adequate capital resources to purchase our products 
if the telecommunications market  and in particular the market for broadband wireless access equipment  does not improve and grow  our business would be substantially harmed 
if the communications and internet industries do not grow and evolve in a manner favorable to our business strategy or us  our business may be seriously harmed 
our future success is dependent upon the growth of the communications industry and  in particular  the internet 
the growth of the global communications and internet industries has slowed significantly over the past two years 
furthermore  these markets continue to evolve rapidly because of advances in technology and changes in customer demand 
we cannot predict growth rates or future trends in technology development 
in addition  the deregulation  privatization and economic globalization of the worldwide communications market  which resulted in increased competition and escalating demand for new technologies and services  may not continue in a manner favorable to us or our business strategies 
in addition  the growth in demand for internet services and the resulting need for high speed or enhanced communications products may not continue at its current rate or at all 
because we operate in international markets  and particularly in china  we are exposed to additional risks which could cause our international sales to decline and our foreign operations to suffer 
sales outside of north america accounted for approximately of our revenues in and of our revenues in sales to china accounted for approximately of our revenues outside of north america in and approximately of our sales outside of north america in we expect that international sales  and in particular sales to china  will account for a substantial portion of our revenues in future periods 
in addition  we maintain research and development facilities in israel 
our reliance on international sales  operations and suppliers exposes us to foreign political and economic risks  which may impair our ability to generate revenues 
these risks include economic and political instability  terrorist acts  international conflicts and acts of war  our international customers ability to obtain financing to fund their deployments  changes in regulatory requirements and licensing frequencies to service providers  import or export licensing requirements and tariffs  
table of contents labor shortages or stoppages  trade restrictions and tax policies  and limited protection of intellectual property rights 
any of the foregoing difficulties of conducting business internationally could seriously harm our business 
competition may result in lower average selling prices  and we may be unable to reduce our costs at offsetting rates  which may impair our ability to achieve profitability 
we expect that price competition among broadband wireless access systems suppliers will reduce our gross margins in the future  particularly in asia 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of broadband wireless access systems will continue to decline as product technologies mature 
we may be unable to reduce our manufacturing costs in response to declining average per unit selling prices 
our competitors may be able to achieve greater economies of scale and may be less vulnerable to the effects of price competition than we are 
these declines in average selling prices will generally lead to declines in gross margins and total profitability for these systems 
if we are unable to reduce our costs to offset declines in average selling prices  we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
terrorist acts  international conflicts and acts of war may seriously harm our business and revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price 
terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world may cause damage or disruption to the company  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  and subsequent terrorist attacks in other countries have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and results of operations 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other actual or potential conflicts or acts of war  including the ongoing military operations in afghanistan and iraq as well as the threat of conflict with north korea  have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  results of operations and stock price in ways that we cannot presently predict 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
any political  economic or other instability in the united states  taiwan  china or israel in particular could adversely affect our suppliers and our business 
our sales and operations in asia  and china in particular  could be disrupted if contagious diseases spread 
the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars and avian influenza bird flu in asia  and china in particular  has disrupted commerce in the region 
if sars  bird flu or other contagious diseases spread in asia  and china in particular  the markets for our products there may be adversely affected 
in addition  we will likely restrict the travel of our sales and technical personnel to china if such diseases are not contained  which could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products in china and provide technical assistance to our customers in china 
in addition  a restriction of flights in china could disrupt shipments of our products into china and delay or curtail sales of our products 
if sars  bird flu or other contagious diseases spread beyond asia  other world markets for our products may also be adversely affected 
since we have significantly reduced our workforce and expenses  we may not be able to address successfully the telecommunications market if and when it recovers 
during  the global telecommunications market  and in particular the fixed wireless broadband access market  experienced a significant downturn 
we experienced dramatic decreases in the sales of our products and the adoption of our technology in  and our sales have continued at a reduced level through in this 
table of contents environment  we determined in that significant expenditures in our historical products and technology were not justified  and we reduced our workforce by approximately  from employees to employees 
during and the first quarter of  our workforce in the wireless broadband access business further declined by seven employees  to employees at march  in the second  third and fourth quarters of  we increased our sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses in connection with our increased efforts in china  although such expenses continue to be at low levels 
while we expect that the telecommunications market may recover over time  any such recovery may occur only slowly 
if the market does not recover in the near future and if our sales do not substantially increase from current levels  we will continue to incur losses and may never achieve profitability 
we may be unable effectively to sell and market our products without substantially further increasing sales and marketing expenses 
furthermore  substantial uncertainty exists as to the ability of our existing products and technology to address this market when it returns 
moreover  our ability to develop and market products that effectively address customer needs in the telecommunications market as it evolves with new and competitive products and technologies may be limited due to  among other things  our limited research and development budget 
the loss of one or more of our key customers would result in a loss of a significant amount of our revenues and adversely affect our business 
a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of our revenues  as set forth in the table below year ended december  customer a customer b customer c customer d customer e customer f customer g represents revenues in from a settlement dispute with a customer based on a license and development agreement entered into between vyyo and the customer in we expect that we will continue to depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues in future periods 
the loss of a major customer could seriously harm our ability to sustain revenue levels  which would seriously harm our operating results 
in addition  many of our customers are dependent on obtaining funding for their deployments 
the continued inability of our customers to obtain such funding will adversely affect their deployments  which would adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to sell shira on acceptable terms  or at all 
in august  the board of directors determined to cease all of shira s business operations and terminate all of shira s employees 
in addition  vyyo is exploring the sale of shira s remaining assets 
vyyo made this decision due to the continuing decline in shira s sales  shira s recurring losses and its inability to penetrate the market 
vyyo would likely receive only minimal value  if any  in a sale of shira 
conditions in israel affect our operations and may limit our ability to produce and sell our systems 
our research and development  final testing and assembly facilities  and some contract manufacturers are located in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect our operations 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its arab neighbors and a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel 
hostilities within israel have dramatically escalated in recent years  which could disrupt our 
table of contents operations 
in addition  the recent united states war against iraq and the current military and political presence of the united states or its allies in iraq could cause increasing instability in the middle east and further disrupt relations between israel and its arab neighbors 
we could be adversely affected by any major hostilities involving israel  the interruption or curtailment of trade between israel and its trading partners  a significant increase in inflation  or a significant downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
as a result of the hostilities and unrest presently occurring within israel and the middle east  the future of the peace efforts between israel and its arab neighbors is uncertain 
moreover  several countries still restrict business with israel and with israeli companies 
we could be adversely affected by restrictive laws or policies directed towards israel or israeli businesses 
our chief financial officer  one of our directors and many of our employees are based in israel  and many of them are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty and are subject to being called to active duty at any time under emergency circumstances 
our business cannot assess the full impact of these requirements on our workforce or business if conditions should change  and we cannot predict the effect on us of any expansion or reduction of these obligations 
because substantially all of our revenues are generated in us dollars while a portion of our expenses are incurred in new israeli shekels  our results of operations may be seriously harmed if the rate of inflation in israel exceeds the rate of devaluation of the new israeli shekel against the us dollar 
we generate substantially all of our revenues in us dollars  but we incur a substantial portion of our expenses  principally salaries and related personnel expenses related to research and development  in new israeli shekels  or nis 
as a result  we are exposed to the risk that the rate of inflation in israel will exceed the rate of devaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar or that the timing of this devaluation lags behind inflation in israel 
if the dollar costs of our operations in israel increase  our dollar measured results of operations will be seriously harmed 
because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers can discontinue purchases of our systems at any time  which could adversely affect future revenues and operating results 
we sell our wireless broadband access systems based on individual purchase orders 
our customers are generally not obligated by long term agreements to purchase our systems  and the agreements we have entered into do not obligate our customers to purchase a minimum number of systems 
our customers can generally cancel or reschedule orders on short notice and discontinue using our systems at any time 
further  having a successful field system trial does not necessarily mean that the customer will order large volumes of our systems 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more of our customers could seriously harm our operating results 
if we determine to continue to pursue other products and business opportunities  we may not be successful in effecting any such transactions on favorable terms  or at all  which could adversely affect our future prospects 
in addition to further developing our traditional wireless business  we also continue to explore alternatives relating to the license  purchase or acquisition of other products  technology  assets or businesses 
we have invested  and we expect that we will continue to invest  significant time and resources searching for and investigating new business opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully effect any of these alternatives on a timely basis or at all 
we may not be able to successfully operate or integrate businesses that we may choose to acquire  in a cost effective and non disruptive manner and realize anticipated benefits 
we continue to explore investments in or acquisitions of other companies  products or technologies  including companies or technologies that are not complementary or related to our current wireless broadband 
table of contents access business 
we may be unsuccessful in operating such other businesses profitably  just as we were unsuccessful in operating shira as a successful business 
in addition  we may have difficulty integrating other companies personnel  operations  products and technologies into our current business 
these difficulties may disrupt our ongoing business  divert the time and attention of our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized 
future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets and the incurrence of large and immediate write offs  any of which could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we expect that we will expend significant resources in searching for and investigating new business opportunities and may be unsuccessful in acquiring new businesses 
the potential effects of regulatory actions could impact spectrum allocation and frequencies worldwide and cause delays or otherwise negatively impact the growth and development of the broadband wireless market  which would adversely affect our business 
countries worldwide are considering or are in the process of allocating frequencies for fixed wireless applications  but not all markets have done so 
in addition  in october  the united states federal communications commission indicated that existing mmds license holders may be able in the future to deploy mobile services using the mmds frequencies 
if service providers in the united states will use mobile technology such as g cellular technology in the mmds band  it will harm our business because vyyo s current technology does not support mobile services 
if the united states and or other countries do not provide sufficient spectrum for wireless applications or reallocate spectrum in the fixed wireless frequency bands for other purposes  our customers may delay or cancel deployments in fixed broadband wireless  which could seriously harm our business 
internationally  there has been delay in the allocation of ghz licenses and our business is highly dependent upon new license grants in china 
any further delays will adversely affect our customers deployments and could significantly harm our business 
our quarterly operating results fluctuate  which may cause our share price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future 
these variations result from a number of factors  including the uncertain timing and level of market acceptance for our systems and the uncertain timing and extent of rollouts of wireless broadband access systems by the major service providers  the ability of our existing and potential direct customers to obtain financing for the deployment of broadband wireless access systems  the mix of products sold by us and the mix of sales channels through which they are sold  reductions in pricing by us or our competitors  global economic conditions  the effectiveness of our system integrator customers in marketing and selling their network systems equipment  changes in the prices or delays in deliveries of the components we purchase or license  and any acquisitions or dispositions we may effect 
a delay in the recognition of revenue  even from one customer  may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations for a given period 
also  because only a small portion of our expenses vary with our revenues  if revenue levels for a quarter fall below our expectations  we will not be able to timely adjust expenses accordingly  which would harm our operating results in that period 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors in future periods  our share price will likely decline 

table of contents competition may decrease our market share  net revenues and gross margins  which may cause our stock price to decline 
the market for broadband access systems is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
certain of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution  marketing and other resources than we have and  therefore  may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities  technologies and other developments 
in addition  many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and established relationships with system integrators and service providers 
our primary competitors are alvarion inc  wi lan inc  sr telecom  harris corporation  cambridge wireless limited  remec  inc and zte corporation 
most of these competitors have existing relationships with one or more of our prospective customers  and many of these companies are operating and increasing their presence in the china market  on which we believe a substantial portion our business will depend 
we also face competition from technologies such as digital subscriber line  fiber and cable 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  and competitive pressures may seriously harm our business 
hardware defects or software errors may increase our costs and impair the market acceptance of our systems  which would adversely affect our future operating results 
our systems will occasionally contain certain defects or errors 
this may result either from defects in components supplied by third parties or from errors or defects in our software or hardware that we have failed to detect 
we have in the past experienced  and may experience from time to time in the future  defects in new or enhanced products and systems after commencement of commercial shipments  or defects in deployed systems 
this may be observed in connection with stability or other performance problems 
our customers integrate our systems into their networks with components from other vendors 
accordingly  when problems occur in a network system  it may be difficult to identify the component that caused the problem 
regardless of the source of these defects or errors  we will need to divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to address the defect or error 
we have incurred in the past and may again incur significant warranty and repair costs related to defects or errors  and we may also be subject to liability claims for damages related to these defects or errors 
the occurrence of defects or errors  whether caused by our systems or the components of another vendor  may result in significant customer relationship problems and injury to our reputation and may impair the market acceptance of our systems 
we depend on contract manufacturers and third party equipment and technology suppliers  and these manufacturers and suppliers may be unable to fill our orders or develop required technology on a timely basis  which would result in delays that could seriously harm our results of operations 
we currently have relationships with a limited number of contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of our fixed broadband wireless systems  which contractors are located in israel  taiwan and china 
these relationships may be terminated by either party with little or no notice 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our systems in required volumes  we would have to identify qualified alternative manufacturers  which would result in delays that could cause our results of operations to suffer 
our limited experience with these manufacturers does not provide us with a reliable basis on which to project their ability to meet delivery schedules  yield targets or costs 
if we are required to find alternative manufacturing sources  we may not be able to satisfy our production requirements at acceptable prices and on a timely basis  if at all 
any significant interruption in supply would affect the allocation of systems to customers  which in turn could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we currently have no formal written agreement with a manufacturer for our modem products 
our current inventory of modems will likely be insufficient to fulfill anticipated demand  and we will therefore be required to find a manufacturer in the near future 
our inability to enter into a written agreement with a manufacturer for our modems would harm our business 
in addition to sales to system integrators  we also sell in some instances directly to service providers 
such direct sales require us to resell to service providers equipment manufactured by third party suppliers and to 
table of contents integrate this equipment with the equipment we manufacture 
we are particularly dependent on third party radio suppliers in selling our ghz and other products 
we currently have no formal relationship with any third party supplier 
if we are unable to establish relationships with suppliers  or if these suppliers are unable to provide equipment that meets the specifications of our customers on the delivery schedules required by our customers  and at acceptable prices  our business would be substantially harmed 
we obtain some of the components included in our systems from a single source or a limited group of suppliers  and the loss of any of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenue 
we currently obtain key components from a limited number of suppliers 
some of these components  such as semiconductor components for our wireless hubs  are obtained from a single source supplier 
we generally do not have long term supply contracts with our suppliers 
these factors present us with the following risks delays in delivery or shortages in components could interrupt and delay manufacturing and result in cancellation of orders for our systems  suppliers could increase component prices significantly and with immediate effect  we may not be able to develop alternative sources for system components  if or as required in the future  suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of components used in our systems 
in such event  we might need to modify our systems  which may cause delays in shipments  increased manufacturing costs and increased systems prices  and we may hold more inventory than is immediately required to compensate for potential component shortages or discontinuation 
the occurrence of any of these or similar events would harm our business 
if we do not develop new systems and system features in response to customer requirements or in a timely way  customers may not buy our products  which would seriously harm our business 
the broadband wireless access industry is rapidly evolving and subject to technological change and innovation 
we may experience design or manufacturing difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new systems and enhancements  any of which could cause us to incur unexpected expenses or lose revenues 
if we are unable to comply with diverse  new or varying governmental regulations or industry standards in each of the many worldwide markets in which we compete  we may not be able to respond to customers in a timely manner  which would harm our business 
if we do not effectively manage our costs in response to the decline in the business outlook  our business could be substantially harmed 
although we reduced the costs of our fixed broadband wireless operations in response to the decline in the telecommunications industry that began around  we have recently increased certain expenses to address international market opportunities  particularly in china  and we will need to continue to monitor closely our costs and expenses 
if the market and our business does not expand  we may need to reduce further our operations 
we depend on our key personnel  in particular davidi gilo  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and michael corwin  our president and chief operating officer  the loss of either of whom could seriously harm our business 
our future success depends in large part on the continued services of our senior management and key personnel 
in particular  we are highly dependent on the service of davidi gilo  our chairman of the board and 
table of contents chief executive officer  and michael corwin  our president and chief operating officer 
we do not carry key person life insurance on our senior management or key personnel 
any loss of the services of davidi gilo or michael corwin  other members of senior management or other key personnel could seriously harm our business 
delays and shortages in the supply of components from our suppliers and third party vendors could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of revenue 
delays and shortages in the supply of components are typical in our industry 
we have experienced minor delays and shortages on more than one occasion in the past 
in addition  any failure of necessary worldwide manufacturing capacity to rise along with a rise in demand could result in our subcontract manufacturers allocating available capacity to larger customers or to customers that have long term supply contracts in place 
our inability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity at acceptable prices  or any delay or interruption in supply  could reduce our revenues or increase our cost of revenue and could seriously harm our business 
third parties may bring infringement claims against us that could harm our ability to sell our products and result in substantial liabilities 
third parties could assert  and it could be found  that our technologies infringe their proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs to defend any litigation  and intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following obtain licenses to the infringing technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  or expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
we also may experience infringement claims based on shira s technology and products 
accordingly  any infringement claim or litigation against us could significantly harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  we may not be able to compete 
our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets and confidentiality and other contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
our pending or future patent applications may not be approved and the claims covered by such applications may be reduced 
if allowed  our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength  and others may independently develop similar technologies or products 
litigation  which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our efforts  may also be necessary to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
any such litigation  regardless of the outcome  could be expensive and time consuming  and adverse determinations in any such litigation could seriously harm our business 
similarly  our pending or future trademark applications may not be approved and may not be sufficient to protect our trademarks in the markets where we either do business or hope to conduct business 
the inability to secure any necessary trademark rights could be costly and could seriously harm our business 
we regularly evaluate and seek to explore and develop derivative products relating to our fixed broadband wireless systems 
we may not be able to secure all desired intellectual property protection relating to such derivative products 
furthermore  because of the rapid pace of change in the broadband wireless industry  much of our business and many of our products rely on technologies that evolve constantly and this continuing uncertainty make it difficult to forecast future demand for our products 

table of contents because of our long product development process and sales cycle  we may incur substantial expenses without anticipated revenues that could cause our operating results to fluctuate 
a customer s decision to purchase our fixed broadband wireless systems typically involves a significant technical evaluation  formal internal procedures associated with capital expenditure approvals and testing and acceptance of new systems that affect key operations 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with our systems can be lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks  over which we have little or no control 
because of the growing sales cycle and the likelihood that we may rely on a small number of customers for our revenues  our operating results could be seriously harmed if such revenues do not materialize when anticipated  or at all 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us  we may not be able to execute our business plan 
we expect that the net proceeds from our initial public offering completed in may  and our secondary public offering completed in september  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds for a number of uses  including acquiring technologies or businesses  hiring additional qualified personnel  and implementing further marketing and sales activities 
we may have to raise funds even sooner in order to fund more rapid expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to otherwise respond to unanticipated requirements 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  we may not be able to increase our ongoing operations if necessary  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance systems or respond to competitive pressures 
this potential inability to raise funds on acceptable terms could seriously harm our business 
government regulation and industry standards may increase our costs of doing business  limit our potential markets or require changes to our business model and adversely affect our business 
the emergence or evolution of regulations and industry standards for broadband wireless products  through official standards committees or widespread use by operators  could require us to modify our systems  which may be expensive and time consuming  and to incur substantial compliance costs 
radio frequencies are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states  foreign laws and international treaties 
each country has different regulations and regulatory processes for wireless communications equipment and uses of radio frequencies 
failure by the regulatory authorities to allocate suitable  sufficient radio frequencies to potential customers in a timely manner could result in the delay or loss of potential orders for our systems and seriously harm our business 
we are subject to export control laws and regulations with respect to certain of our products and technology 
we are subject to the risk that more stringent export control requirements could be imposed in the future on product classes that include products exported by us  which would result in additional compliance burdens and could impair the enforceability of our contract rights 
we may not be able to renew our export licenses as necessary from time to time 
in addition  we may be required to apply for additional licenses to cover modifications and enhancements to our products 
any revocation or expiration of any requisite license  the failure to obtain a license for product modifications and enhancements  or more stringent export control requirements could seriously harm our business 

table of contents the government programs and benefits we receive require us to satisfy prescribed conditions 
these programs and benefits may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase our costs and taxes and could seriously harm our business 
certain of our capital investments have been granted approved enterprise status under israeli law providing us with certain israeli tax benefits 
the benefits available to an approved enterprise are conditioned upon the fulfillment of conditions stipulated in applicable law and in the specific certificate of approval 
if we fail to comply with these conditions  in whole or in part  we may be required to pay additional taxes for the period in which we enjoyed the tax benefits and would likely be denied these benefits in the future 
from time to time  the government of israel has considered reducing or eliminating the benefits available under the approved enterprise program 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at all 
the termination or reduction of these benefits would increase our taxes and could seriously harm our business 
as of the date hereof  our israeli subsidiary has accumulated loss carry forwards for israeli tax purposes and therefore has not enjoyed any tax benefits under current approved enterprise programs 
in the past  we received grants from the government of israel for the financing of a portion of our research and development expenditures for previous products in israel 
the regulations under which we received these grants restrict our ability to manufacture products or transfer technology outside of israel for products developed with this technology 
furthermore  these grants may not be available to us in the future 
the government of israel has decided to cancel  as of june   the ability of companies to submit new applications for approved enterprise status 
this change in the government policy may hinder us in the future with respect to any benefits we may have received for new undertakings which would have been entitled to approved enterprise status 
several of our directors and officers have relationships with davidi gilo and his affiliated companies that could be deemed to limit their independence 
several members of our board of directors  lewis broad  neill brownstein  avraham fischer  samuel kaplan and alan zimmerman  and our president and chief operating officer  michael corwin  have had professional relationships with our chairman of the board  davidi gilo  and his affiliated companies for several years 
these members of our board of directors previously served on the boards of directors of dsp communications  inc and or dsp group  inc  of which mr 
gilo was formerly the controlling stockholder and the chairman of the board  and mr 
corwin previously served as an officer of dsp group 
in addition  avraham fischer is a senior partner of the law firm of fischer  behar  chen co  which represents us on matters relating to israeli law  and is an investor and co chief executive officer of an israeli investor group in which mr 
gilo is also an investor 
there are no family relationships between these directors and officers  and no member of our compensation committee serves as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee 
however  the long term relationships between these directors and officers and mr 
gilo and his affiliated companies could be deemed to limit their independence 
the extensive business activities of our board members could cause new facts to develop that could also be deemed to limit their independence 
because our management has the ability to control stockholder votes  the premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay may be reduced and any merger or takeover may be delayed 
our management collectively own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  will be able to control the outcome of all matters submitted for stockholder action  including electing members to our board of directors  approving significant change in control transactions  
table of contents determining the amount and timing of dividends paid to themselves and to our public stockholders  and controlling our management and operations 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business consolidation involving us  or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
this concentration of ownership could also negatively affect our stock s market price or decrease any premium over market price that an acquirer might otherwise pay 
because the nasdaq national market is likely to continue to experience extreme price and volume fluctuations  the price of our stock may decline 
the market price of our shares has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including the following actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results or those of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or technological innovations  introduction and adoption of new industry standards  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  changes in the market valuations of our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or partnerships  and sales of our common stock 
many of these factors are beyond our control and may negatively impact the market price of our common stock  regardless of our performance 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and telecommunications related companies in particular  have been highly volatile 
our common stock may not trade at the same levels of shares as that of other technology companies and shares of technology companies  in general  may not sustain their current market prices 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may be the target of similar litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
if our stock price falls below per share  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
in order for our common stock to continue to be quoted on the nasdaq national market  we must satisfy various listing maintenance standards established by nasdaq  including the requirement that our common stock maintain a minimum bid price of at least per share 
under nasdaq s listing maintenance standards  if the closing bid price of our common stock remains below per share for consecutive trading days  nasdaq will issue a deficiency notice to vyyo 
if the closing bid price subsequently does not reach per share or higher for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days during the calendar days following the issuance of the deficiency notice from nasdaq  nasdaq may de list our common stock from trading on the nasdaq national market 
during the third quarter of  our stock price had a closing bid price below for over consecutive trading days  although the price has since increased to over as a result of the for reverse stock split effected by vyyo in august vyyo cannot predict whether the market price for our common stock will remain above 
a delisting may negatively impact the value of the stock  since stocks trading on the over the counter market are typically less liquid and trade with larger variations between the bid and ask price 

table of contents provisions of our governing documents and delaware law could discourage acquisition proposals or delay a change in control 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that change in control would be beneficial to stockholders 
specifically our board of directors has the authority to issue common stock and preferred stock and to determine the price  rights and preferences of any new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  our board of directors is divided into three classes  each serving three year terms  super majority voting is required to amend key provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  there are limitations on who can call special meetings of stockholders  stockholders are not able to take action by written consent  and advance notice is required for nominations of directors and for stockholder proposals 
in addition  provisions of delaware law and our stock option plans may also discourage  delay or prevent a change of control or unsolicited acquisition proposals 
it may be difficult to enforce a us judgment against us and our nonresident chief financial officer  director and experts 
our chief financial officer  one of our directors  and some of the experts named in this report are nonresidents of the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are located outside the united states 
therefore  it may be difficult to enforce a judgment obtained in the united states based upon the civil or criminal liabilities provisions of the united states federal securities laws against us or any of those persons or to effect service of process upon these persons in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
substantially all of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a substantial portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels  or nis 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
in the event of an increase in inflation rates in israel  or if appreciation of the nis occurs without a corresponding adjustment in our dollar denominated revenues  our results of operation and business could be materially harmed 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
substantially all of these amounts consisted of corporate and government fixed income securities and money market funds that invest in corporate and government fixed income securities that are subject to interest rate risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and by policy limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  all investments with maturities of three months or greater are classified as available for sale and considered to be short term investments 
while all our cash equivalents and short term investments are classified as available for sale  we generally have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect 
table of contents our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
we may not be able to obtain similar rates after maturity as a result of fluctuating interest rates 
we do not hedge any interest rate exposures 
quantitative interest rate disclosure as of december  if market interest rates were to increase on december  immediately and uniformly by  the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately  or approximately of the total portfolio approximately of total assets 
assuming that the average yield to maturity on our portfolio at december  remains constant throughout and assuming that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december  remain constant for the duration of  interest income for would be approximately million 
assuming a decline of in the market interest rates at december   interest income for would be approximately million in  which represents a decrease in interest income of approximately  the decrease in interest income will result in a decrease of the same amount to net income and cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s cash equivalents and available for sale securities at december   over the remaining contractual lives
