item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview anadarko petroleum corporation s primary line of business is the exploration  development  production and marketing of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
the company s major areas of operations are located in the united states  canada and algeria 
the company is also active in venezuela  qatar and several other countries 
the company s focus is on adding high margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive finding and development costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of producing oil and gas 
the primary factors that affect the company s results of operations include  among other things  commodity prices for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  production volumes  the company s ability to find additional oil and gas reserves  as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations

analysis of sales volumes barrels of oil equivalent mmboe united states canada algeria other international total barrels of oil equivalent per day mboe d united states canada algeria other international total during  anadarko sold mmboe  a decrease of mmboe or compared to sales of mmboe in the decrease for was primarily due to lower volumes of mmboe from operations in canada  related primarily to the divestiture of heavy oil properties in late and mmboe from operations in algeria due primarily to the substantial completion of cost recovery  whereby anadarko was reimbursed for previous exploration spending with additional barrels of oil production 
these decreases were partially offset by higher volumes of mmboe from operations in the united states  primarily due to higher oil production in the western states as a result of the acquisition of howell in late the company s sales volumes were down mmboe or in compared to sales of mmboe in the decrease for was primarily due to lower volumes of mmboe due to operations in the united states  primarily offshore and in texas and louisiana  and mmboe related to the disposition of operations in guatemala and argentina in the decrease in volumes in the united states was primarily a result of natural production declines and a decrease in development drilling in late and early in response to lower commodity prices 
these lower volumes were offset by an increase of mmboe in algeria due to the expansion of production facilities 
sales volumes represent actual production volumes adjusted for changes in commodity inventories 
anadarko employs marketing strategies to help manage volumes and mitigate the effect of price volatility  which is likely to continue in the future

the company s natural gas sales volumes in were down bcf or compared to the decrease in was due primarily to lower volumes of bcf from operations within the united states  primarily offshore and in texas  partially offset by higher volumes of bcf from operations in canada primarily due to the berkley acquisition in production of natural gas is generally not directly affected by seasonal swings in demand 
however  the company may decide during periods of low commodity prices to decrease development activity  which can result in lower production volumes 
the company s average realized natural gas price in increased compared to strong demand in north america due to colder weather and declining gas supply resulted in significantly higher gas prices 
these higher prices were partially offset by commodity price hedges on of natural gas sales volumes during that reduced the company s exposure to low prices and limited participation in higher prices 
the company s average realized natural gas price in decreased compared to the decrease in prices during was attributed to a severe decline in natural gas demand as a result of high prices in early  followed by a national economic downturn and mild summer weather in as of december   the company has hedged about of its anticipated natural gas wellhead sales volumes for see derivative instruments under item a of this form k

the lower canada volumes are due largely to the sale of the company s heavy oil assets in late the lower algeria volumes are due primarily to the substantial completion of cost recovery  whereby anadarko was reimbursed for previous exploration spending with additional barrels of oil production 
the higher volumes in the united states are primarily in the western states as a result of the howell acquisition in late crude oil and condensate sales volumes for increased mmbbls or compared to the increase was due primarily to higher volumes of mmbbls from operations in algeria primarily due to the expansion of production facilities and mmbbls due to the acquisition of producing properties in qatar in these higher volumes were partially offset by lower volumes of mmbbls due to the sale of producing properties in guatemala and argentina in  mmbbls related to operations in the united states  primarily offshore  and mmbbls in venezuela primarily due to higher oil prices 
production of oil usually is not affected by seasonal swings in demand or in market prices 
anadarko s average realized crude oil price in increased compared to the higher crude oil prices during are attributed primarily to political unrest in the middle east  the oil workers strike in venezuela  low oil inventory levels and increased demand 
these higher prices were partially offset by commodity price hedges on of crude oil and condensate sales volumes during that reduced the company s exposure to low prices and limited participation in higher prices 
the company s average realized crude oil price in increased compared to the higher crude oil prices in were due primarily to continued uncertainty of the situation in the middle east  the oil workers strike in venezuela and a colder than normal winter late in that increased oil demand in the united states 
as of december   the company had hedged about of its anticipated oil and condensate volumes for natural gas liquids sales volumes and average prices total mmbbls mbbls d price per barrel the company s ngls sales volumes increased mmbbls or compared to primarily due to additional natural gas volumes processed in central texas 
ngls sales volumes in were essentially flat compared to during  average ngls prices increased compared to the higher ngls prices are attributed primarily to high natural gas prices in the united states during natural gas prices generally serve as a minimum or floor for ngls prices because ngls production is highly dependent on the economics of processing the natural gas to extract ngls 
the average ngls prices decreased compared to high levels of ngls inventories in the united states during the first half of  coupled with lower demand for ngls by the petrochemical industry  caused ngls prices to decline

operating results anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling  improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties 
reserve replacement anadarko continues to be successful in replacing reserves 
for the nd consecutive year  anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls 
the following table shows the company s reserve replacement through all means  including extensions and discoveries  revisions  improved recovery and purchases or sales of proved reserves  as a percentage of production volumes 
reserve replacement percentages excluding acquisitions and divestitures represent reserve replacement achieved through drilling and development 
five year average worldwide reserve replacement reserve replacement excluding acquisitions and divestitures production mmboe united states reserve replacement reserve replacement excluding acquisitions and divestitures production mmboe the company s worldwide reserve replacement excluding acquisitions and divestitures increased to in this increase was primarily due to successful drilling in the us and canada 
the decrease in compared to was partially due to a downward revision of mmboe in venezuela due to increased prices 
see critical accounting policies and estimates 
anadarko s us reserve replacement percentage excluding acquisitions and divestitures increased to in the increase in was due primarily to successful drilling in east texas and louisiana and successful enhanced oil recovery projects in the western states 
the company s us reserve replacement for the five year period was excluding acquisitions and divestitures 
by comparison  the most recent published us industry average was source doe 
anadarko s us reserve replacement performance for the same period of was of production  excluding acquisitions and divestitures 
industry data for is not yet available 
cost of finding cost of finding represents the cost of proved reserves added through all means  including additions related to extensions and discoveries  revisions  improved recovery and purchases of proved reserves 
the following table shows the company s cost of finding proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls  stated on a boe basis 
cost of finding excludes asset retirement costs and includes actual asset retirement expenditures 
five year average worldwide cost of finding cost of finding excluding acquisitions united states cost of finding cost of finding excluding acquisitions worldwide finding costs in decreased compared to worldwide finding costs in were higher than and due primarily to downward revisions of venezuelan reserves primarily related to higher prices see critical accounting policies and estimates and large investments made in leases in the eastern gulf of mexico that had not yet been drilled 
cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development 
a better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period 
for the five year period  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe and its us finding cost was per boe 
for the previous five year period  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe and its us finding cost was per boe 
excluding acquisitions  anadarko s worldwide and us finding costs for the five year period were per boe and per boe  respectively 
for the previous five year period  the company s worldwide and us finding costs excluding acquisitions were per boe and per boe  respectively 
proved reserves at the end of  anadarko s proved reserves were billion boe compared to billion boe at year end and anadarko s proved reserves have grown over the past three years  primarily as a result of corporate acquisitions  successful exploration projects in the gulf of mexico and successful development programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and in algeria 
the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved gas reserves have increased since year end  as a result of corporate acquisitions  continued development activity onshore in the us and producing property acquisitions 
anadarko s proved crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end were billion barrels compared to billion barrels at year end and proved crude oil reserves have risen over the last three years primarily due to corporate acquisitions  successful exploration projects in the gulf of mexico and successful development programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and in algeria 
crude oil  condensate and ngls comprise of the company s proved reserves at year end  and at december   the present value discounted at of future net revenues from anadarko s proved reserves was billion  before income taxes  and billion  after income taxes  stated in accordance with the regulations of the sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
the after income taxes increase of billion or in compared to is primarily due to additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling and development and higher natural gas prices at year end see supplemental information under item of this form k 
the present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
recent developments the sec obtained information from oil and gas companies operating offshore including anadarko to assess the criteria being used by industry to determine proved reserves related to new field discoveries offshore 
the sec regulations allow companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either an actual production test flow test or conclusive formation testing 
in the absence of a production test  compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves related to the initial discovery of a field 
in deepwater environments where production tests are extremely expensive  the industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility 
anadarko has recorded proved reserves related to the initial discovery of four offshore fields based on conclusive formation tests rather than actual production tests 
as of december   these proved reserves amounted to mmboe or less than of anadarko s total worldwide proved reserves 
a significant portion of these reserves are located at marco polo  a deepwater field at green canyon block scheduled for first production in mid the company is currently developing three other fields k  k north and tarantula and expects production from these fields to commence in when production commences  the issue of economic producibility is resolved 
anadarko believes these reserves are properly classified 
anadarko is unable to predict the likely outcome of the sec s staff review of this industry practice 
the issue is not expected to have a material impact on the company s proved reserves or financial results  however  if the issue is not favorably resolved  anadarko may be required to revise its proved reserve estimates  which would affect anadarko s finding costs per barrel  reserve replacement ratios and dd a expense  until flow tests are conducted or production commences 
drilling activity during  anadarko participated in a total of  gross wells  including gas wells  oil wells and dry holes 
this compares to gross wells gas wells  oil wells and dry holes in and  gross wells gas wells  oil wells and dry holes in the increase in activity during reflects the company s increase in spending for development drilling in response to higher commodity prices in the decrease in activity during reflects the company s reduced spending for development drilling in response to lower commodity prices in late and early the company s exploration and development drilling program is discussed in oil and gas properties and activities under item of this form k

in  anadarko acquired approximately mmboe of proved reserves  located primarily in the united states 
in  anadarko acquired approximately mmboe of proved reserves  including mmboe located in the united states primarily from the howell acquisition mmboe and mmboe located in qatar 
in  the company acquired approximately mmboe of proved reserves  located in canada  primarily from the berkley acquisition mmboe  qatar and oman from the gulfstream resources canada limited acquisition mmboe  and the united states mmboe 
excluding corporate acquisitions  during  anadarko acquired through purchases and trades mmboe of proved reserves for million 
during the same time period  the company sold properties  either as a strategic exit from a certain area or asset rationalization in existing core areas  of mmboe with proceeds totaling million 
in  the company will continue to consider dispositions of certain producing properties in non core areas 
marketing strategies overview the company s sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale 
therefore  even though the company sells significant volumes to major purchasers  the company believes other purchasers would be willing to buy the company s natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls at comparable market prices 
the company s marketing department actively manages sales of its oil and gas 
the company markets its production to customers at competitive prices  maximizing realized prices while managing credit exposure 
the market knowledge gained through the marketing effort is valuable to the corporate decision making process 
the company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of gas  oil  condensate and ngls 
however  the company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities 
the company s trading risk position  typically  is a net short position that is offset by the company s natural long position as a producer 
essentially all of the company s trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months 
see derivative instruments under item a of this form k 
since  all segments of the energy market have experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition  liquidity and credit 
this has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies 
in  anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third party gas purchasers  however  in certain situations the company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit for purchases 
natural gas natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of north america s energy needs and the company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue 
the tightening of the natural gas supply and demand fundamentals has resulted in extremely volatile natural gas prices  which is expected to continue 
anadarko markets its equity natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets 
anadarko energy services company aes  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko  is a marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing  risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs 
the company also purchases natural gas physical volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near anadarko s production 
these purchases allow the company to aggregate larger volumes of gas and attract larger  creditworthy customers  which in turn enhances the value of the company s production 
the company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
the company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative instruments 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s gas production was sold under long term contracts to duke energy duke 
these sales represent  and  respectively  of total revenues in  and most of these contracts have expired or will expire at the end of the first quarter of the company expects to integrate the marketing of the natural gas previously sold to duke into its current marketing operations and sell it to various purchasers under short term agreements at market prices 
volumes sold to duke under the long term contracts were at market prices 
a company anadarko acquired in was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within the gathering  processing and marketing gpm business segment  which was sold in to duke 
most of these agreements were transferred to duke in the gpm disposition 
one agreement was retained  but is managed and operated by duke 
anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the company s natural gas 
as part of the gpm disposition  anadarko pays duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke pays anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
this keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contract s expiration date or february the company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure under the duke keep whole agreement to potential decreases in future transportation market values 
while derivatives are intended to reduce the company s exposure to declines in the market value of firm transportation  they also limit the potential to benefit from increases in the market value of firm transportation 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis prices 
basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the new york mercantile exchange nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices  discounted at per year 
management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors such as expected drilling activity  anticipated pipeline construction projects  expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points  etc 
that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted 
crude oil  condensate and ngls anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls revenues are derived from production in the us  canada  algeria and other international areas 
most of the company s us crude oil and ngls production is sold under day evergreen contracts with prices based on marketing indices and adjusted for location  quality and transportation 
most of the company s canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater 
oil from algeria and other international areas is sold by tanker as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel 
the company also purchases and sells third party produced crude oil  condensate and ngls in the company s domestic and international market areas 
included in this strategy is the use of various derivative instruments 
gas gathering systems and processing anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested about million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years 
the vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
the company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction of ngls in efficient plants with flexible commitments 
anadarko also processes gas and has interests in three company operated plants and three non operated plants 
anadarko s strategy to aggregate gas through company owned and third party gathering systems allows anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the company has significant production 
capital resources and liquidity general anadarko s cash flow from operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in cash flow is attributed primarily to the significant increase in commodity prices 
the decrease in cash flow compared to is attributed to significantly lower natural gas prices 
fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in the past 
anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk 
anadarko s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations 
the company s goals include continuing to find high margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices  managing commodity price risk and keeping operating costs at efficient levels 
in july  anadarko implemented a cost reduction plan that eliminated more than million of overhead costs from the company s annual cost structure  which included cuts in personnel and corporate expenses 
this cost reduction plan lowered costs and expenses by million and capitalized overhead costs by million 
restructuring costs associated with this plan are approximately million and charged to income as specific liabilities are incurred 
restructuring costs of million were expensed during these relate to one time employee termination benefits million  contract termination costs million and other costs million 
the remaining restructuring costs are expected to be paid and expensed in for additional information on restructuring costs see note restructuring costs of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
debt at year end  anadarko s total debt was billion compared to total debt of billion at year end  a decrease of about million 
this compares to billion at year end the decrease in debt during was related primarily to repaying debt that was incurred as a result of the howell acquisition in late and repaying notes that matured in in march  anadarko issued million of zero yield puttable contingent debt securities zyp codes due in march  zyp codes in the amount of million were put to the company for repayment and were paid in cash 
holders of the remaining zyp codes have the right to require anadarko to purchase all or a portion of their zyp codes in march   or  at  per zyp codes 
in february  the company issued million principal amount of notes due in march  the company issued million principal amount of notes due the net proceeds from these issuances were used to reduce floating rate debt and to fund the zyp codes put to the company for repayment in march in april  anadarko filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that permits the issuance of up to billion in debt securities  preferred stock  preferred securities  depositary shares  common stock  warrants  purchase contracts and purchase units 
net proceeds  terms and pricing of the offerings of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings 
after giving effect to the securities issuances described below  the company may issue  subject to market conditions  up to million in additional securities under this registration statement 
in september  anadarko issued million principal amount of notes due the net proceeds from the issuance were used to reduce floating rate debt 
these notes were issued under the shelf registration statement filed in april in april  anadarko redeemed for cash its callable zero coupon convertible debentures due anadarko funded the million redemption with available credit facilities that carried a lower effective interest rate 
anadarko paid per debenture  reflecting the issue price plus accrued interest at 
in may  the company issued million principal amount of notes due the net proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce floating rate debt that was incurred in april to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures due these notes were issued under the shelf registration statement filed in april for additional information on the company s debt instruments  such as years of maturity and interest rates  see note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
capital expenditures the company funded its capital investment programs in  and primarily through cash flow  plus increases in long term debt and proceeds from property sales 
the following table shows the company s capital expenditures by category 
millions development exploration acquisitions of oil and gas properties gathering and other capitalized interest and internal costs related to exploration and development costs total excludes corporate acquisitions 
excludes asset retirement costs and includes actual asset retirement expenditures  which is consistent with prior years 
anadarko s total capital spending in was billion  a increase compared to the increase from represents a million increase in development spending and a million increase in other spending  partially offset by a million decrease in exploration spending 
the increase in development spending and the decrease in exploration spending reflect the company s decision to direct capital to the areas that have shown the best performance and rate of return  primarily the lower states  during periods of higher prices 
anadarko s total capital spending in was billion  a decrease compared to the decrease from represents a million decrease in development spending  a million decrease in exploration spending and a million decrease in other spending 
the decrease in spending for development activities reflects the company s decision to focus on increasing its inventory of drilling prospects by identifying new reserves through exploration  rather than growing production through development during the down cycle in energy prices in early dividends in  anadarko paid million in dividends to its common stockholders cents per share in the first  second and third quarters and cents per share in the fourth quarter 
in  anadarko paid million in dividends to its common stockholders cents per share in the first  second and third quarters and cents per share in the fourth quarter 
the dividend amount in was million cents per share in the first  second and third quarters and cents per share in the fourth quarter 
anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in the company s credit agreement allows for a maximum capitalization ratio of debt  exclusive of the effect of any noncash writedowns 
as of december   anadarko s capitalization ratio was debt 
while there is no specific restriction on paying dividends  under the maximum debt capitalization ratio retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends at december  the amount of future common stock dividends will depend on earnings  financial conditions  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
in  and  the company also paid million  million and million  respectively  in preferred stock dividends 
in  preferred stock dividends are expected to be million 
outlook the company s capital expenditure budget has been set between billion and billion 
anadarko has allocated billion to billion for worldwide exploration and development 
approximately will be designated for development and about for exploration 
the primary focus of the budget is to direct capital to the areas that have shown the best performance and rate of return 
anadarko made a number of significant discoveries in and a top priority in will be to delineate and develop those discoveries 
in addition  the company plans to carry out a focused exploration program in north america  north africa and the middle east 
anadarko s overall plan includes about million for capitalized interest and overhead 
in conjunction with the cost reduction plan  the company evaluated the allocation of capital resources to international exploration for while management sees an important place for international projects within its portfolio  anadarko has narrowed the list of international projects in order to better focus its efforts 
as a result  the company expects to work toward divesting its non core assets in egypt  australia and oman during net cash flow from operations in is expected to be in the same range as capital spending and additional borrowings are not anticipated in the company s initial capital budget for is based on estimates of cash flow from operations using prices below january nymex levels 
the company intends to adjust capital expenditures to reflect changes in its cash flow from operations 
if higher prices are realized  the company may expand the drilling program  make targeted acquisitions or further reduce net debt 
if commodity prices significantly decrease  the company may curtail capital spending projects  as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
the company has had a stock buyback program to purchase up to billion in shares of anadarko common stock since the repurchase program does not obligate anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time 
the company did not purchase any shares under this program in to date  the company has repurchased million of its common stock under this program 
no stock purchases have been budgeted for both exchange and over the counter traded financial derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements 
margin deposits are required of the company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed predetermined credit limits 
given the company s sizable hedge position and price volatility  the company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements 
during  the company s margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to million 
the company did not have any margin deposits outstanding at december  anadarko believes that operating cash flow and existing or available credit facilities will be adequate to meet its capital and operating requirements for the company funds its day to day operating expenses and capital expenditures from operating cash flows  supplemented as needed by short term borrowings under commercial paper  money market loans or credit facility borrowings 
to facilitate such borrowings  the company has in place a million committed credit facility  which is supplemented by various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates 
as of december   anadarko had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility 
it is the company s policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities 
the company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets 
to facilitate such financings  the company may file shelf registrations in advance with the sec 
the company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property sales and additional borrowing  to secure other funds for additional capital expenditures 
at this time  anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  the executives and directors benefits trust  the exercise of stock options  the issuance of restricted stock or the company s employee savings plan and employee stock ownership plan equity funded contributions

critical accounting policies and estimates financial statements and use of estimates in preparing financial statements  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes and determination of proved reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
properties and equipment the company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the sec 
under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
in  the carrying amount of oil and gas properties also includes estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development costs of oil and gas properties and mineral investments are amortized using the unit of production method 
all other properties are stated at original cost and depreciated on the straight line basis over the useful life of the assets  which ranges from three to years 
proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves  as defined by sec regulation s x rule a i  ii  iii  and  are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the dd a rate calculation and the financial statements 
under the terms of anadarko s risk service contract with the national oil company of venezuela  anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices economic interest method 
this means that higher oil prices reduce the company s reported production volumes and reserves from that project and lower oil prices increase reported production volumes and reserves 
production volume and reserve changes due to the prices used to determine the company s economic interest have no impact on the value of the project 
costs excluded oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate for that country 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 
significant properties  comprised primarily of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks  alaska  the land grant and other international areas  are individually evaluated each quarter by the company s exploration and engineering staff 
nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the company s exploration program to date 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of drilling individual wells 
the company has a to year exploration and evaluation program for the land grant acreage 
costs are transferred accordingly to the dd a pool over the length of the program 
the land grant s mineral interests both working and royalty interests are owned by the company in perpetuity 
all other significant properties are evaluated over a five to ten year period  depending on the lease term 
insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the united states and canada 
nonproducing leases are transferred to the dd a pool over a three to five year period based on the average lease term 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of evaluation 
capitalized interest sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  provides standards for the capitalization of interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets 
under fasb interpretation fin no 
applying fasb statement no 
to oil and gas producing operations accounted for by the full cost method  costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects  on which dd a expense is not currently taken and on which exploration or development activities are in progress  qualify for capitalization of interest 
capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the company s weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs excluded 
capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense 
as costs excluded are transferred to the dd a pool  the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the dd a pool 
ceiling test companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  including the effect of cash flow hedges 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligation 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes and asset retirement obligation exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
a ceiling test impairment can give anadarko a significant loss for a particular period  however  future dd a expense would be reduced 
derivative instruments anadarko holds derivative instruments for its energy marketing and trading business and to manage foreign currency risk and commodity price risk associated with its equity oil and gas production and the firm transportation keep whole agreement 
anadarko accounts for its derivative instruments under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under this statement  all derivatives other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
accounting for unrealized gains and losses related to derivatives used to manage foreign currency risk and commodity price risk associated with equity oil and gas production is dependent on whether the derivative instruments have been designated and qualify as part of a hedging relationship 
derivative instruments may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values  cash flows or foreign currencies  if certain conditions are met 
if the hedged exposure is to changes in fair value  the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative instrument  as well as the associated losses and gains on the hedged item  are recognized currently in earnings 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into revenues in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gains and losses from the derivative instrument  if any  is recognized currently in other income expense 
hedge ineffectiveness is that portion of the fair value change of the hedge that exceeds the fair value change of the hedged item 
in those instances where it is probable that a forecasted transaction subject to a cash flow hedge will not occur  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to revenues in the current period 
unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recorded on the basis of whether the hedge is a fair value or cash flow hedge 
unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized currently in revenues 
derivative instruments  including both physical delivery and financially settled purchase and sale contracts  used in the company s energy marketing and trading activities and the firm transportation keep whole agreement are accounted for under the mark to market accounting method 
under this method  fair value changes are recognized currently in earnings 
the marketing and trading margin related to equity production is recorded to gas and oil sales 
the non equity portion of the margin is recorded to other sales 
gains and losses related to the firm transportation keep whole agreement are recorded to other income expense 
anadarko formally documents the relationship of each hedge to a hedged item including the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
each hedge is also routinely assessed for effectiveness 
the company s derivative instruments are generally either exchange traded or valued by reference to a commodity that is traded in a liquid market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data 
option valuations are based on the black scholes option pricing model and verified against third party quotations 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated based on quoted natural gas basis prices 
basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices  discounted at per year 
management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors such as expected drilling activity  anticipated pipeline construction projects  expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points  etc 
that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted 
recent accounting developments the emerging issues task force eitf is considering two issues related to the reporting of oil and gas mineral rights 
issue no 
o  whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets  is whether or not mineral rights are intangible assets pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations 
issue no 
s  application of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to oil and gas companies  is  if oil and gas drilling rights are intangible assets  whether those assets are subject to the classification and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
anadarko classifies the cost of oil and gas mineral rights as properties and equipment and believes that this is consistent with oil and gas accounting and industry practice 
if the eitf determines that oil and gas mineral rights are intangible assets and are subject to the applicable classification and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 the company estimates that billion and million would be reclassified from properties and equipment to intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent oil and gas mineral rights acquired after june through the end of the respective periods 
these amounts are net of accumulated dd a 
in addition  the disclosures required by sfas nos 
and would be made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
there would be no effect on the consolidated statements of income or cash flows as the intangible assets related to oil and gas mineral rights would continue to be amortized under the full cost method of accounting 
regulatory matters and additional factors affecting business forward looking statements the company has made in this report  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
these forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves  schedules  plans  timing of development  contributions from oil and gas properties  and those statements preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  projects  target  goal  plans  objective  should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
for such statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k and in the company s other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management 
anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
commodity pricing and demand crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide  pricing decisions and production quotas of opec and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets 
in addition  in opec countries in which anadarko has production such as algeria  venezuela and qatar  when the world oil market is weak  the company may be subject to periods of decreased production due to government mandated cutbacks 
natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile 
in periods of sharply lower commodity prices  the company may curtail production and capital spending projects  as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the company s determination of proved reserves and the company s calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves 
in addition  demand for oil and gas in the us and worldwide may affect the company s level of production 
under the full cost method of accounting  a noncash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties on a country by country basis may be required when prices are low 
whether the company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter  as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter 
while this noncash charge can give anadarko a significant reported loss for the period  future expenses for dd a will be reduced 
environmental and safety the company s oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the company s failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the company s operations 
anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition in the past 
however  because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
for a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the company is involved  see note contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
exploration and operating risks the company s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering and fire  any of which could result in damage to  or destruction of  oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage  including certain physical damage  employer s liability  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
although anadarko is not insured against all risks in all aspects of its business  such as political risk  business interruption risk and risk of major terrorist attacks  the company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations 
the occurrence of a significant event against which the company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
development risks the company is involved in several large development projects 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
in large development projects  these uncertainties are usually resolved  but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may  therefore  affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects 
domestic governmental risks the domestic operations of the company have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
foreign operations risk the company s operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
the company s international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  the company s international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
competition the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production 
the company s competitors include major oil and gas companies  independent oil and gas companies  individual producers  gas marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
some of the company s competitors may have greater and more diverse resources upon which to draw than does anadarko 
if the company is not successful in its competition for oil and gas reserves or in its marketing of production  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
other regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells  regulate well spacing  prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters 
operations conducted by the company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions  including various nondiscrimination statutes 
additionally  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the bureau of land management and the minerals management service of the us department of the interior 
in addition to the standard permit process  federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan 
any significant increase in costs associated with regulatory compliance or restrictions imposed on the company s operations by regulation may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
legal proceedings general the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including  but not limited to  royalty claims  contract claims and environmental claims 
the company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims  including numerous claims by employees of third party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos  silica and benzene while working at a refinery in corpus christi  texas  which a company anadarko acquired by merger in sold in segments in and while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company  although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments anadarko s derivative instruments currently are comprised of futures  swaps and options contracts 
the volume of derivative instruments utilized by the company to hedge its market price risk and in its energy trading operation can vary during the year within the boundaries of its established risk management policy guidelines 
for information regarding the company s accounting policies related to derivatives and additional information related to the company s derivative instruments  see note summary of significant accounting policies and note financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
derivative instruments held for non trading purposes the company had equity production hedges of bcf of natural gas and mmbbls of crude oil as of december  excluding physical delivery fixed price contracts 
as of december   the company had a net unrealized loss of million before taxes on these commodity derivative instruments 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in commodity prices would result in an additional loss on these commodity derivative instruments of approximately million 
however  this loss would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of that portion of the company s equity production that is hedged 
derivative instruments held for trading purposes as of december   the company had a net unrealized gain of million gains of million and losses of million on commodity derivative financial instruments entered into for trading purposes and a net unrealized loss of million gains of million and losses of million on derivative physical delivery contracts entered into for trading purposes 
utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a decrease in underlying commodity prices  the potential additional loss on the derivative instruments would be approximately million 
firm transportation keep whole agreement a company anadarko acquired in was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its gpm business segment  which was sold in to duke 
as part of the gpm disposition  anadarko pays duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke pays anadarko if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
this keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contract s expiration date or february the company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure under the keep whole agreement to potential decreases in future transportation market values 
due to decreased liquidity  the use of derivative instruments to manage this risk is generally limited to the forward twelve months 
as of december   accounts payable included million and other long term liabilities included million related to this agreement 
as of december   accounts payable included million and other long term liabilities included million related to this agreement 
a unfavorable change in prices on the short term portion of the keep whole agreement would result in an additional loss of million 
the future gain or loss from this agreement cannot be accurately predicted

for additional information regarding the company s marketing and trading portfolio and the firm transportation keep whole agreement see marketing strategies under item of this form k 
interest rate risk anadarko is also exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of the company s floating rate debt 
the company believes the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of the company s various debt instruments is not material 
foreign currency risk the company s canadian subsidiaries use the canadian dollar as their functional currency 
the company s other international subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency  the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
a canadian subsidiary has notes and debentures denominated in us dollars 
the potential foreign currency remeasurement impact on earnings from a increase in the december  canadian exchange rate would be about million based on the outstanding debt at december  for additional information related to foreign currency risk see note financial instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k
