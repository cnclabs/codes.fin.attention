item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a incorporating item a in this report  the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation opc and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries 
occidental is divided into two segments oil and gas and chemical 
business environment oil and gas oil and gas prices are the key variables that drive the industry s financial performance 
prices can vary significantly  even on a short term basis 
oil prices continued to strengthen in over their levels in the previous year 
the average west texas intermediate wti market price for was barrel bbl compared with bbl in nymex domestic natural gas prices increased significantly from for  nymex gas prices averaged mcf compared with mcf for chemical the sectors of the chemical industry in which occidental participates showed signs of improvement in largely due to the improving economy and the continued strength of the building and construction markets 
the industry experienced higher product prices for all major commodity chemicals  however  the margin improvement was largely offset by higher costs for key raw materials  primarily energy and ethylene 
domestic chlorine demand dropped slightly in  compared to  as the robust housing sector could not overcome general weakness in other manufacturing markets 
however  chlorine prices increased sharply in from their depressed levels in early in part due to the tightening of supply resulting from industry capacity reductions and the favorable influence of the strong vinyls vcm pvc demand  mainly in the housing sector 
caustic soda prices began to improve in the second quarter of but softened late in the year due to pressure to move more caustic soda volume versus chlorine 
however  overall caustic soda prices improved for the year 
pvc prices improved significantly although the price improvement was largely offset by higher raw material costs 
strategy and overall performance occidental s overall corporate strategy aims to generate competitive total returns to stockholders and consists of three basic elements focus on large  long lived oil and gas assets with growth potential 
maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet 
harvest cash from chemicals 
large  long lived legacy oil and gas assets  like those in california  the permian basin in texas and qatar  tend to have moderate decline rates  enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production 
these assets are expected to contribute substantial earnings and cash flow after capital 
at occidental  maintaining financial discipline means prudently investing capital in projects that are expected to generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle 
during periods of high commodity prices  occidental will use the bulk of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve future earnings levels by acquiring additional properties with low risk characteristics or through debt reduction 
the chemicals business generates free cash flow 
in  free cash flow for the segment was approximately million  which compares favorably with the year annual average 
the segment was able to achieve this result despite a difficult year for the chemical industry as a whole 
for a calculation of chemical free cash flow  see selected cash flow information below 
in order to ensure that its strategic objectives are reached  occidental s management focuses on the following key business goals over the short term achieve top quartile performance  compared to peer companies  in return on equity with a below average level of debt 
segments are to achieve top quartile performance  compared to peer companies  in return on assets and other measurements unique to that segment 
these include profits per unit produced  costs to produce each unit  cash flow per unit  costs to find and develop new reserves and other similar measures 
debt structure occidental s total debt and total debt to capitalization ratios are shown in the table below total debt to capitalization date amounts in millions total debt a ratio a includes trust preferred securities redeemed january   natural gas delivery commitment which was terminated in  subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations 
occidental s year end total debt to capitalization ratio has declined to approximately percent from the percent level that existed at the end of  as shown in the table above 
the decrease in the total debt to capitalization ratio in compared to is the result of total debt reductions of percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of percent over the same period 
return on equity three year average annual a b a the return on equity for was calculated by dividing occidental s earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in b the return on equity for the three year period was calculated as the sum of the annual earnings applicable to common stock for each of the three years ended divided by the sum of the ending equity balances for each year end in the same period 
over the past three years  occidental has focused on improving its return on equity 
in  occidental s return on equity was percent and the three year average return on equity was percent 
during the same three year period  occidental s equity increased by over percent 
oil and gas strategy the oil and gas business strategy has three parts that  together  are focused on adding new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace well ahead of production  while simultaneously keeping finding and development costs among the lowest in the industry continue to add commercial reserves in and around occidental s core areas  which are the us  middle east and latin america  through a combination of focused exploration and development programs 
pursue commercial opportunities with host governments in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil in place by applying appropriate technology and innovative reservoir management practices 
maintain a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices 
over the past several years  the asset base within each of the core areas has been strengthened 
occidental has invested in assets with higher performance potential and sold properties with low or no current return 
the results of these changes are discussed below in business review oil and gas 
chemical strategy oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain where it begins with chlorine  which is co produced with caustic soda  and then converts chlorine and ethylene  through a series of intermediate products  into pvc 
oxychem mainly focuses on being a low cost producer to maximize its cash flow generation 
business review oil and gas occidental s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its oil and gas business strategy  beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california 
the elk hills acquisition was followed in april by the purchase of altura energy in the permian basin in west texas for billion and thereafter by several smaller acquisitions 
during  occidental enhanced its industry leading position in the permian basin by making several complementary acquisitions 
at the end of  the elk hills and permian basin assets made up percent of occidental s worldwide proven oil reserves and percent of its proven gas reserves 
on a boe basis  they accounted for percent of occidental s worldwide reserves 
in  the combined production from these assets averaged approximately  boe per day  which represents percent of occidental s total worldwide production 
these businesses also contributed approximately percent of oil and gas segment earnings 
elk hills occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california s san joaquin valley with an approximate percent interest 
the field was acquired in for billion and is the largest producer of gas in california 
production in was approximately  boe per day 
since the acquisition date  elk hills has generated total net pre tax cash flow of approximately billion  after subtracting million of capital expenditures  and has replaced percent of its total elk hills oil and gas production of million boe 
at the end of  the property still had an estimated million boe of proved reserves  compared to the million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition 
occidental s california natural gas production is declining as it produces the elk hills gas cap  but the decline has been mitigated by increased development activities 
total gas production averaged mmcf per day in compared to mmcf in permian basin the entire permian basin is the largest oil basin in the lower united states and accounts for approximately percent of total us oil production 
occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin with approximately percent of the total permian production 
occidental integrated its acquisition of altura  which was valued at approximately billion  with its previously existing permian basin properties in southwest texas and southeast new mexico 
since the acquisition in  the former altura properties have generated approximately billion in total net pre tax cash flow  after subtracting capital expenditures of approximately million 
one element of occidental s strategy in the permian basin is to acquire producing properties at attractive prices that offer synergies with its existing operations 
in  occidental made a number of complementary acquisitions in the permian basin for a total purchase price of million 
these acquisitions increased total proven reserves by million boe for an average cost of per boe 
on january   occidental acquired a  mile oil gathering and pipeline system in the permian basin 
this system will allow occidental to efficiently gather and transport its production to midland where it has storage facilities 
the remainder of the pipeline s capacity will be filled by third party producers 
net permian oil and gas production averaged  boe per day in compared to  boe per day in approximately percent of occidental s permian basin production is reliant upon the application of carbon dioxide co flood technology  an enhanced oil recovery technique 
this involves injecting co into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent  causing the oil to flow more freely so it can be pumped to the surface 
the size of these co flood operations makes occidental a world leader in the development and application of this technology 
thums occidental purchased thums  the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore long beach  california  in occidental s share of production from thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a production sharing contract  whereby occidental s share of production varies inversely with oil prices 
for  net production from the thums oil property averaged  barrels per day 
gulf of mexico occidental has a one third interest in the deep water horn mountain oil field  which is occidental s only asset in the gulf of mexico 
bp plc bp is the operator 
the field began production in november and production was increased until it reached platform capacity in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  occidental s net production at horn mountain averaged  boe per day 
hugoton occidental owns a large concentration of gas reserves  production interests and royalty interests in the hugoton area of kansas and oklahoma 
the hugoton field is the largest natural gas field discovered to date in north america 
occidental s hugoton operations produced  mcf of natural gas and  barrels of oil per day in middle east dolphin project in  occidental purchased a percent interest in the dolphin project for million 
this investment includes a percent interest in dolphin energy limited dolphin energy  the operator of the dolphin project 
the dolphin project consists of two parts a development and production sharing agreement with qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in qatar s north field for years  with a provision to request a year extension  and the rights for dolphin energy to build  own and operate a mile long  inch export pipeline to transport billion cubic feet per day of dry natural gas from qatar to markets in the united arab emirates uae for the life of the dolphin project and longer 
the pipeline will have capacity to transport up to billion cubic feet per day  which will allow for additional business opportunities 
several important milestones have been reached since occidental joined the dolphin project 
in  two development wells were drilled and tested  providing sufficient information to complete the field development plan 
in october  dolphin energy signed two year contracts to supply approximately one bcf of natural gas per day to two entities in the uae 
a third supply contract with the emirate of dubai is currently being negotiated 
in addition  other markets for natural gas and hydrocarbon liquids are being pursued 
in december  the government of qatar approved the final field development plan for the dolphin project 
based on the foregoing developments  occidental recorded million boe of proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves in most recently  in january  dolphin energy awarded engineering  procurement and construction contracts for the gas processing and compression plant at ras laffan in qatar as well as for two offshore gas production platforms 
the plant will receive wet gas from dolphin s facilities in qatar s north field and will remove hydrocarbon liquids  including condensate and natural gas liquids  for further processing and sale 
the resulting dry gas will be compressed and transported to the uae through dolphin energy s pipeline 
the projected start up date for production is in the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately billion in total 
occidental expects to invest approximately billion for its percent share in the dolphin project over the next three years 
a portion of the project costs may be project financed 
during  occidental expects to invest approximately to million  which is expected to be provided by occidental s operating cash flow 
this investment is in addition to occidental s expected capital expenditures of billion that are discussed under liquidity and capital resources 
as the project has not begun operation  no revenue or production costs were recorded in qatar by introducing advanced drilling systems and applying new waterflooding and reservoir characterization techniques in the idd el shargi north dome isnd field  occidental has increased production and recoverable reserves from the field 
occidental is moving forward with a second phase under its existing agreement in the development of isnd 
the new phase is targeting the development and recovery of additional reserves from isnd 
occidental is also engaged in full field development of the idd el shargi south dome issd field which  as a satellite to the north dome  reduces the overall capital requirement of the two projects 
combined production from the two fields averaged  barrels per day  net to occidental  in also  see the dolphin project discussed above 
yemen in yemen  occidental owns direct working interests in the masila field in block percent and a percent interest in the east shabwa field  comprising a percent direct working interest and a percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity 
occidental s net production averaged  barrels of oil per day in  with  coming from the masila field and the remainder from east shabwa 
oman occidental s oman business is centered in block where it holds a percent working interest in the production sharing contract for this block 
net production to occidental averaged  barrels of oil per day in occidental has entered into a gas sales and purchase agreement with the government of oman to sell approximately million gross cubic feet of natural gas per day from block operations to the government 
first gas sales are anticipated in mid this agreement has opened up a market for previously stranded gas that is associated with oil production from the safah field 
occidental also continues its exploration program in the adjacent block in  the government of oman approved a farm out of a percent working interest in block to mitsui e p middle east bv mitsui 
as a result  occidental and mitsui now share the same working interest percentages in both block and block libya occidental suspended all activities in libya in as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the us government  but continues to hold an interest in the assets that it formerly operated 
since the imposition of sanctions  occidental has derived no economic benefit from its libyan interests and has no libyan assets on its balance sheet 
over the past two years  occidental representatives have met with libyan officials  under specific authority and guidelines set by the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac  for the purpose of fact finding and discussing generally the status of its contractual interests and property rights 
recent developments that have led to an improvement in us libya relations have given rise to speculation that the sanctions could be eased  or perhaps lifted  in the near future 
until that happens  occidental will continue complying with the existing sanctions and its ofac licenses 
occidental remains very interested in returning to libya  where it had considerable success in finding and developing large volumes of commercial oil reserves 
management is carefully monitoring the dynamics of the evolving us libya relationship 
other eastern hemisphere pakistan occidental holds oil and gas working interests  that vary from to percent  in four badin blocks in pakistan 
bp is the operator 
in  occidental purchased additional interests in two of these blocks from the government of pakistan for approximately million 
gross production was  boe per day  while occidental s net share was approximately  boe per day 
russia in russia  occidental owns percent of a joint venture company  vanyoganneft  that operates in the western siberian oil basin 
production for was approximately  boe per day  net to occidental 
latin america colombia occidental has a percent net share of production and is the operator of the cano limon oil field in colombia 
cumulative gross production from cano limon reached one billion barrels of oil in colombia s national oil company  ecopetrol  operates the cano limon covenas oil pipeline and marine export terminal 
the pipeline transports oil produced from the cano limon field for export to international markets 
in addition  occidental has working interests in three exploration blocks rio aipe percent  chipiron percent and cosecha percent 
production in approximated levels as improved security along the export pipeline reduced the number of attacks by local terrorist groups below the peak levels of occidental s net share of production averaged  barrels of oil per day 
occidental s interests in colombia account for approximately percent of its worldwide assets  percent of its total worldwide reserves and about percent of its worldwide oil and gas production in occidental anticipates that it will recover the proved reserves attributable to its contract 
ecuador net production in block  which occidental operates with a percent working interest  averaged approximately  barrels of oil per day in in the second half of  the increased production from the eden yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of block coincided with the completion of the oleoducto de crudos pesados ocp ltd 
oil export pipeline  in which occidental has a percent interest 
full field development of the eden yuturi oil field is underway with continued development drilling planned in in addition  work continues in the producing areas in the western portion of the block at the indillana complex and the yanaquincha and limoncocha fields 
these projects are expected to increase production by  barrels per day  for a total net production of  barrels per day in in addition  occidental has completed extensive d seismic surveys and plans to continue expanding its exploration activities in block in foreign oil companies  including occidental  have been paying a value added tax vat  generally calculated on the basis of to percent of expenditures for goods and services used in the production of oil for export 
until  oil companies  like other companies producing products for export  filed for and received reimbursement of vat 
in  the ecuador tax authority announced that the oil companies vat payments did not qualify for reimbursement 
in response  the affected oil companies filed actions in the ecuador tax court to seek a judicial determination that the expenditures are subject to reimbursement 
in november  occidental initiated an international arbitration proceeding against the ecuadorian government under the united states ecuador bilateral investment treaty based on occidental s belief that the ecuadorian government is arbitrarily and discriminatorily refusing to refund the vat to occidental 
arbitration proceedings continue at present 
occidental believes that it has a valid claim for reimbursement under applicable ecuador tax law and the treaty 
in the event of an unfavorable outcome  the potential financial statement effect would not be significant 
production sharing contracts occidental conducts its operations in qatar  oman and yemen under production sharing contracts and  under such contracts  receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
chemical chlor alkali demand for chlor alkali products improved throughout the first half of with combined chlorine and caustic soda prices peaking about mid year 
however  as supply and demand shifted to a more balanced position  prices softened in the latter part of the year 
oxychem s chlor alkali operating rate for was percent  approximately matching the industry 
domestic caustic soda pricing improved in the second quarter  but then fell to its lowest level of the year in the fourth quarter 
export pricing for caustic soda remained weak throughout the year as the worldwide supply exceeded demand  exerting downward pressure on pricing 
oxychem maintained its deer park chlor alkali production facility in houston  texas and its edc facility in ingleside  texas in standby mode 
in june  oxychem idled a circuit which produced chlorine and caustic soda at its delaware city plant 
these idle facilities will be reactivated upon strengthening in overall economic conditions that leads to improved demand and higher margins for caustic soda 
vinyls continuing strength in natural gas and ethylene prices pushed costs higher in pvc  and led to price increases of two cents per pound per month for four consecutive months in early  for a total increase of percent 
these increases were in addition to the percent increase in pvc resin prices in  which was also driven by rising feedstock and energy costs 
total year demand was lower by percent compared with for  ethylene prices rose by over cents per pound  and average natural gas costs were nearly per million british thermal units mmbtu higher than oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of percent for  slightly above the north american industry average operating rate of percent 
in the fourth quarter of  export markets for both pvc and vcm strengthened notably  helped by vcm outages in the us and overseas 
disposition of equistar interest and acquisition of lyondell interest in august  occidental sold its percent share of equistar to lyondell and purchased a percent equity interest in lyondell 
occidental entered into these transactions to diversify its petrochemicals interest 
these transactions reduced occidental s direct exposure to the inherent volatility in the petrochemicals markets  yet will allow it to participate  through its lyondell investment  in the economic recovery of the petrochemicals industry 
in connection with these transactions  occidental wrote down its investment in the equistar partnership to fair value by recording a million pre tax charge as of december when this transaction closed in the third quarter of  occidental recorded an after tax gain of million 
as a result of increases in its investment during  at december   occidental owned percent million shares of lyondell stock with a carrying value of million 
disposition of chrome and calendering operations in the fourth quarter of  occidental sold its chrome business at castle hayne  north carolina for million and its plastic calendering operations in rio de janeiro  brazil for a million note receivable 
in the third quarter of  occidental recorded an after tax impairment charge of million and classified both of these businesses as discontinued operations 
corporate and other corporate and other includes the investments in lyondell and premcor  inc  a refining business  and a leased co generation facility in taft  louisiana 
in  corporate and other will also include the results of a  mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the permian basin  which was acquired in january and will be used in corporate directed oil and gas marketing and trading operations 
in july  occidental sold its interests in a subsidiary that owned a texas intrastate natural gas pipeline system and also sold its interest in a liquefied natural gas lng project in indonesia 
after tax proceeds of approximately million from these transactions were used to reduce debt 
outlook oil and gas the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces 
crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather  inventory levels  competing fuel prices  overall demand and the availability of supply 
in the last half of  worldwide oil prices strengthened due to increasing concerns about the security and availability of ample supplies to meet growing demand 
continued economic growth  resulting in increased demand and concerns about supply availability  could result in continued high prices 
a lower growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices 
sustained high oil prices will significantly affect profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers 
however  the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations within price cycles 
although oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty  the wti price has averaged approximately barrel over the past ten years 
while supply demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term  day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets  such as on the nymex and other exchanges  which make it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence 
over the last ten years  the nymex gas price has averaged per mcf 
chemical the chemical business has been profitable historically  however  the average level of earnings has declined over the past several years 
the major factors that have an impact on the performance of this business are general economic conditions  including demand for chemical products  energy and feedstock costs  and the effect of changes in available capacity 
over the last five years  the us chemical industry and its primary market  the us based manufacturing industry  have faced significant challenges 
foreign competition continues to make price increases by the us manufacturing industry difficult to achieve 
in the chemical industry  increasing natural gas prices  which affect us electricity prices  have sharply reduced  and in many cases eliminated  the domestic chemical industry s natural advantage of proximity to its markets 
this has affected basic commodity chemicals such as caustic soda  chlorine and pvc  but is particularly significant for niche specialty products such as resorcinol  mercaptans and antimony based products 
as a result  the us based chemical industry is facing increasing pressure from competitors in both domestic and export markets 
export sales accounted for approximately percent of occidental s chemical sales 
the end of the most recent recession and resultant world economic recovery is expected to improve the overall outlook 
construction of lng terminals on the us gulf coast could stabilize natural gas prices at a lower than current level and thereby help improve the competitive position of efficient gulf coast chemical facilities 
however  this may not occur in the immediate future 
although occidental s chemical business is profitable  if us manufacturing becomes non competitive on a worldwide basis  this could shorten the estimated productive lives of some of occidental s plants  resulting in higher annual depreciation 
significantly shorter productive lives could also result in asset impairments  including plant closures 
it is unlikely that any changes in estimated productive lives would be uniform 
while potential impairment charges could have a material impact on the earnings in a discrete period  such changes are unlikely to have a material effect on occidental s overall financial situation 
for additional discussion of the possible financial effect  please see the critical accounting policies and estimates section below in the md a 
chlor alkali further improvement in chlor alkali operating rates is expected in and beyond as domestic demand for chlorine and caustic soda is forecasted to increase percent in pvc and other downstream derivatives are leading the growth in demand for chlorine 
demand growth for caustic soda is expected to track closely with overall manufacturing activity 
with increasing demand and improved capacity utilization  pricing for chlorine is expected to continue to rise compared to caustic soda prices should also improve as overall manufacturing demand strengthens 
vinyls gross domestic product gdp growth in the latter part of and consensus forecasts of gdp growth exceeding percent for north america are encouraging and suggest a strengthening in the economy that will favorably impact chlorovinyls 
overall  occidental expects percent growth in vinyls demand in north america in pvc and vcm operating rates are expected to move upward during the year  also averaging percent higher than rates 
chlorovinyls supply constraints  together with high energy costs  have created conditions for vinyls price increases early in resin producer price increases of cents per pound have taken effect for january  and a second cents per pound increase has been announced for february 
in addition  vcm intermediates are expected to be in shorter supply than pvc because of industry capacity reductions and maintenance requirements 
average operating rates for north american vcm producers are expected to exceed percent 
the increased demand for chlorine and tighter vcm supplies  due to capacity reductions  is expected to result in supply restrictions for vinyl producers 
segment operations the following discussion of occidental s two operating segments and corporate items should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements 
segment earnings exclude interest income  interest expense  unallocated corporate expenses  discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  but include gains and losses from dispositions of segment assets and results from the segments equity investments

significant items affecting earnings occidental s results of operations often include the effects of significant transactions and events affecting earnings that vary widely and unpredictably in nature  timing and amount 
therefore  management uses a measure called core earnings  which excludes those items 
this non gaap measure is not meant to disassociate those items from management s performance  but rather is meant to provide useful information to investors interested in comparing occidental s earnings performance between periods

cost of sales decreased in  compared to  due mainly to lower chemical raw material costs  partially offset by volume increases in oil and gas 
selling  general and administrative and other operating expenses increased in compared with the increases were in several areas 
general and administrative costs increased in both oil and gas and corporate infrastructure and general support areas 
in addition  non operating costs were generally higher in international operations  mainly latin america 
higher oil and gas production taxes reflected the overall increase in worldwide production

taxes deferred tax liabilities were million at december   net of deferred tax assets of million 
the current portion of the deferred tax assets of million is included in prepaid expenses and other 
the net deferred tax assets are expected to be realized through future operating income and reversal of taxable temporary differences 
liquidity and capital resources financing activity during  occidental strengthened its liquidity position  generating approximately billion in cash from operations 
although future volatility in commodity prices may result in varying operating cash flows  occidental believes that cash on hand  cash generated from operating activities  unused committed bank credit lines and other sources of funds  such as debt issued in the capital markets and the receivables sale program  will be adequate to satisfy its future financial obligations and liquidity needs 
as of december   available borrowing capacity under occidental s unused committed bank credit lines was billion 
occidental had approximately million in cash on hand at december   an increase of million from a portion of the year end cash balance was used to redeem all of the outstanding percent trust preferred redeemable securities trust preferred securities on january  the trust preferred securities were redeemed at par plus accrued interest  resulting in a decrease in current liabilities of approximately million 
in  occidental recorded a pre tax interest charge of million to repay a million percent senior notes issue that had ten years of remaining life  but was subject to remarketing on april  occidental refinanced million of this amount and paid the remaining million out of existing cash 
in  occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of various securities  including senior debt securities 
in november  occidental issued million of percent medium term senior notes  series c  and million of percent medium term senior notes  series c  due for general corporate purposes 
in march  occidental issued million of percent medium term senior notes and used the proceeds to refinance a portion of the million senior notes discussed above 
occidental has million of securities remaining under the shelf registration 
in  occidental repaid and or redeemed approximately million of senior notes and medium term notes and a subsidiary of occidental issued million of preferred stock 
occidental retains all common shares of the subsidiary and elects the majority of the directors 
the subsidiary is the holding company for a number of international subsidiaries of occidental 
in the event that the subsidiary fails to pay preferred dividends for two consecutive quarters or upon the occurrence of certain other events  the holder of the preferred stock could gain control of the subsidiary s board of directors 
cash flow analysis in millions net cash provided by operating activities    the increase in operating cash flow in compared to resulted from higher net income 
the lower operating cash flow in  compared with  results from lower core earnings and higher working capital usage 
non cash charges in include deferred compensation  stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals 
non cash charges in include environmental remediation accruals and the asset writedown for two chemical facilities 
non cash charges in include environmental remediation accruals 
and also include charges for employee benefit plans and other items 
in millions net cash used by investing activities   the amount includes several permian basin acquisitions totaling million 
the amount includes approximately million for a percent interest in the dolphin project and dolphin energy  including million for historical costs 
the amount includes the gross proceeds of million from the sale of the entity that owns a texas intrastate pipeline system and the sale of occidental s interest in the tangguh lng project in indonesia 
also  see the capital expenditures section below 
in millions net cash used by financing activities  the amount includes net debt repayments of million 
the amount reflects the net million buyout of the natural gas delivery commitment and million of net proceeds from the issuance of a subsidiary s preferred stock 
the amount reflects the repayment of billion of long term and non recourse debt  partially offset by proceeds of million from new long term debt 
occidental paid common stock dividends of million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in millions oil and gas    chemical corporate and other total    the chemical amount includes million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in laporte  texas and million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars 
occidental s capital spending estimate for is approximately billion 
in addition  occidental expects to spend million to million on the dolphin project 
a majority of the capital spending will be allocated to oil and gas  with the main focus on qatar  elk hills and the permian basin 
commitments at december   for major capital expenditures during and thereafter were approximately million 
occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations and  as needed  with proceeds from existing credit facilities 
analysis of financial position the changes in the following components of occidental s balance sheet are discussed below selected balance sheet components in millions cash and cash equivalents trade receivables  net income tax receivable investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries   property  plant and equipment  net   current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities accounts payable accrued liabilities dividends payable trust preferred securities current trust preferred securities non current other deferred credits and liabilities   stockholders equity   the higher balance in cash and cash equivalents at december   compared to december   reflects the build up of cash  part of which was used to redeem million of trust preferred securities in january the higher balance in trade receivables at december   compared with december   reflects higher product prices and sales volumes during the fourth quarter of versus in the oil and gas segment 
the decrease in income tax receivable was due to a tax receivable from the equistar sale that was received in the higher balance in investments in unconsolidated entities primarily reflects a capital contribution to the ecuador ocp pipeline investment  additional purchases of lyondell and premcor stock and mark to market increases in the available for sale premcor investment 
the increase in the net balance in property  plant and equipment reflects capital spending  the addition of the acquired permian basin assets and the consolidation of the oxymar property  plant and equipment as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  partially offset by depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the decrease in current maturities of long term debt is due to the fact that a lower level of debt will mature in the increase in accounts payable is due to higher payable balances in the oil and gas marketing and trading operations 
the decrease in accrued liabilities is due to lower mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments 
the decrease in dividends payable is due to the fact that at the end of  there were two quarters of dividend accruals due to an early declaration in of a dividend paid in at june   pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
 the trust preferred securities were reclassified to long term liabilities 
at year end  they were further reclassified to current liabilities as occidental announced its intention to redeem all of the trust preferred securities 
on january   all of the trust preferred securities were redeemed 
other deferred credits and liabilities include deferred compensation  other post retirement benefits  environmental remediation reserves  asset retirement obligations and other deferred items 
the increase in other deferred credits and liabilities in  compared to  was primarily due to the asset retirement obligation that was recorded in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
the increase in stockholders equity primarily reflects net income and issuance of new stock related to options exercised  partially offset by dividends on common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements in the course of its business activities  occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives 
the accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed 
occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities 
these transactions  or groups of transactions  are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and  unless otherwise noted  are not reflected on occidental s balance sheets 
the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions 
dolphin project see discussion of the dolphin project in the business review oil and gas  middle east section of the md a above 
ecuador in ecuador  occidental has a percent interest in the ocp oil export pipeline 
in the second half of  the increased production from the eden yuturi oil field in the southeastern corner of block coincided with the completion of the pipeline 
occidental made capital contributions of million in and as of december   has contributed a total of million to the project 
occidental reports this investment in its consolidated statements using the equity method of accounting 
the project was funded in part by senior project debt 
the senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in ecuador  including occidental 
under their ship or pay commitments  occidental and the other upstream producers have each assumed their respective share of project specific risks  including operating risk and force majeure risk 
occidental would be required to make an advance tariff payment in the event of prolonged force majeure  upstream expropriation events  bankruptcy of the pipeline company or its parent company  abandonment of the project  termination of an investment guarantee agreement with ecuador  or certain defaults by occidental 
this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt 
occidental s obligation relating to the pipeline company s senior project debt totaled million  and occidental s obligations relating to performance bonds totaled million at december  as occidental ships product using the pipeline  its overall obligations will decrease with the reduction of the pipeline company s senior project debt 
elk hills power occidental has a percent interest in elk hills power llc ehp  a limited liability company that operates a gas fired  power generation plant in california 
ehp is a variable interest entity vie under the provisions of fin occidental has concluded it is not the primary beneficiary of ehp and  therefore  accounts for this investment using the equity method 
in january  ehp entered into a million construction loan facility  which was amended in may to increase the facility to million 
upon construction completion on july   the facility converted to a million term loan  percent of which is guaranteed by occidental 
receivables sale program occidental has an agreement in place to sell  under a revolving sale program  an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade receivables 
this program is used by occidental as a low cost source of working capital funding 
the balance of receivables sold at december  and was million 
this amount is not included in the debt and related trade receivables accounts  respectively  on occidental s consolidated balance sheets 
receivables must meet certain criteria to qualify for the program 
under this program  occidental serves as the collection agent with respect to the receivables sold 
an interest in new receivables is sold as collections are made from customers 
fees and expenses under this program are included in selling  general and administrative and other operating expenses 
the fair value of any retained interests in the receivables sold is not material 
the buyers of the receivables are protected against significant risk of loss on their purchase of receivables 
occidental provides for allowances for any doubtful receivables based on its periodic evaluation of such receivables 
the provisions for such receivables were not material in the years ended december   and the program can terminate upon the occurrence of certain events  which generally are under occidental s control or relate to bankruptcy 
in such an event  alternative funding would have to be arranged  which could result in an increase in debt recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding increase in the accounts receivable balance 
the consolidated income statement effect of such an event would not be significant 
leases occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements  mainly for railcars  power plants  manufacturing facilities and office space 
the leased assets are used in occidental s operations where leasing offers advantages of greater operating flexibility and generally costs less than alternative methods of funding that were available at the time financing decisions were made 
lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales 
see contractual obligation table below 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets and or disclosed in the accompanying notes 
payments due by year contractual to to and obligations in millions total thereafter consolidated balance sheet long term debt note a   capital leases note other long term liabilities b other obligations operating leases note c  purchase obligations d   total      a includes trust preferred securities reported as current liabilities at december   and excludes fair value hedge mark to market adjustments and unamortized debt discounts 
b primarily includes obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans 
c amounts are presented gross of sublease rental income 
d primarily includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business 
some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations 
due to their long term nature  purchase contracts with terms greater than years are discounted using a percent discount rate 
lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in a substantial number of lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings 
these actions seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
opc and certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and similar federal  state and local environmental laws 
these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  however  occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  including environmental proceedings  occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
during the course of its operations  occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal  state  local and foreign tax jurisdictions 
taxable years prior to are closed for us federal income tax purposes 
taxable years through are in various stages of audit by the internal revenue service 
disputes arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law 
occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity  drilling services  electrical power  steam and certain chemical raw materials 
at december   the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements  which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers  aggregated million  which was payable as follows in millions    and fixed payments under these agreements were million in  million in and million in occidental has certain other commitments under contracts  guarantees and joint ventures  and certain other contingent liabilities 
many of these commitments  although not fixed or determinable  involve capital expenditures and are part of the billion capital expenditures estimated for  and the to million estimated to be spent on the dolphin project in as discussed under significant accounting changes below  fin requires the disclosure in occidental s financial statements of information relating to guarantees issued by occidental and outstanding at december  these guarantees encompass performance bonds  letters of credit  indemnities  commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties  mainly to provide assurance that occidental and or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees 
at december   the notional amount of the guarantees was approximately million 
of this amount  approximately million relates to occidental s guarantee of equity investees debt and other commitments 
the debt guarantees relating to elk hills power and the guarantees on debt and other commitments relating to the ecuador pipeline have been discussed above in the off balance sheet arrangements section 
the remaining million relates to various indemnities and guarantees provided to third parties 
occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental 
these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds 
as of december   occidental is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future indemnity claims against it for material amounts in connection with these transactions 
it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits  claims and proceedings  audits  commitments  contingencies and related matters 
if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental s reserves  an outcome not currently anticipated  it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  after taking into account reserves  management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental liabilities and expenditures occidental s operations in the united states are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality 
foreign operations also are subject to environmental protection laws 
costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are generally expected to rise in the future 
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process 
these expenditures are mainly considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 
environmental remediation the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases 
in many cases  the laws apply regardless of fault  legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites 
opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites  comparable state sites and other remediation sites  including occidental facilities and previously owned sites 
also  opc and certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including  in some instances  having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal  state and local environmental laws 
these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties 
occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary  glenn springs holdings  inc gsh  which reports its results directly to occidental s corporate management 
the following table presents occidental s environmental remediation reserves at december   and grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites amounts in millions of reserve of reserve of reserve sites balance sites balance sites balance cercla equivalent sites active facilities closed or sold facilities total the increase in the number of cercla and equivalent sites between and was primarily in the minimal no exposure category as discussed below 
the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three reporting periods in millions balance beginning of year increases to provision including interest accretion changes from acquisitions dispositions payments other balance end of year occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years 
occidental expects that it may continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these and other sites 
the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to million beyond the amount accrued 
for management s opinion  refer to the lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters section above 
cercla and equivalent sites at december   opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in cercla or state equivalent proceedings  as shown below 
reserve description amounts in millions of sites balance minimal no exposure a reserves between mm reserves over mm total a includes sites for which maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and indemnified occidental  sites where occidental has denied liability without challenge  sites where occidental s reserves are less than  each  and sites where reserves are between  and million each 
the seven sites with individual reserves over million in are a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee  two closed landfills in western new york  groundwater treatment facilities at three former chemical plants western new york  montague  michigan and tacoma  washington and a municipal drinking water treatment plant in western new york 
active facilities certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at active facilities 
four facilities certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states  a chemical plant in louisiana  a chemical plant in texas  and a phosphorous recovery operation in tennessee account for percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 
closed or sold facilities there are sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements 
three sites account for percent of the reserves associated with this group 
the three sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions  a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania  and a former chemical plant in west virginia 
environmental costs occidental s costs  some of which may include estimates  relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  are shown below for each segment in millions operating expenses oil and gas chemical capital expenditures oil and gas chemical remediation expenses corporate operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis 
capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities 
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
although total costs may vary in any one year  over the long term  segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 
in october  the federal environmental protection agency epa approved a state implementation plan sip for eight counties in the houston galveston area of texas to implement certain requirements of the federal clean air act 
the sip contains provisions requiring the reduction of percent of nitrogen oxide emissions and percent of certain volatile organic compound emissions by november occidental operates six facilities that are subject to the sip s emissions reduction requirements and estimates that its future capital expenditures will total approximately to million for environmental control and monitoring equipment necessary to comply with the sip 
occidental expects expenditures to end in  although the timing of the expenditures will vary by facility 
occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance including the sip discussed above will be approximately million for and million for foreign investments portions of occidental s assets outside north america are exposed to political and economic risks 
occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against those risks 
at december   the carrying value of occidental s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately billion  or approximately percent of occidental s total assets at that date 
of such assets  approximately billion are located in the middle east  approximately million are located in latin america  and substantially all of the remainder are located in pakistan 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of occidental s management 
there has been no material change to these policies over the past three years 
the selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
oil and gas properties occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration costs  geological  geophysical and seismic costs and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 
there are several factors that could change occidental s recorded oil and gas reserves 
occidental receives a share of production from production sharing contracts to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices improve and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
in other contractual arrangements  sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental s control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
these factors  in turn  could lead to a reduction in the quantity of recorded proved reserves 
an additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those assumed when the reserves were initially recorded 
overall  occidental s revisions to proved reserves were positive for  and and amounted to less than percent of the total reserves for each year 
additionally  occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to sfas no 
generally when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly 
there have been no impairments of reserves over the past three years 
depreciation and depletion of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved recoverable reserves 
the change in the depreciation and depletion rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous reserve estimates has been immaterial 
if occidental s oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on the depreciation and depletion rate 
for example  a percent increase in the amount of oil and gas reserves would change the rate from barrel to barrel  which would increase pre tax income by million annually 
a percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from barrel to barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million annually 
a portion of the carrying value of occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the costs attributable to unproved properties were approximately million 
these costs are not currently being depreciated or depleted 
as exploration and development work progresses and the reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made 
the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance 
chemical assets the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its property  plant and equipment 
occidental s chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities 
the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical assets  which range from years to years  are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests 
the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to maintain the facilities in good operating condition 
without these continued expenditures  the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease 
other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants include higher or lower product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy prices  environmental regulations  competition and technological changes 
occidental is required to perform impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  or when management s plans change with respect to those assets 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 occidental must compare the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value 
the key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy costs  significantly increased regulation and remaining estimated useful life 
due to a temporary decrease in demand for some of its products  occidental temporarily idled an edc plant in june  a chlor alkali plant in december and a portion of a chlor alkali plant in june these facilities will remain idle until market conditions improve 
management expects that these plants will become operational in the future 
the net book value of these plants was million at december  based on year end value  the chlor alkali plant that closed on december  has a percent minority interest of million 
these facilities are periodically tested for impairment and  based on the results  no impairment is deemed necessary at this time 
occidental continues to depreciate these facilities based on their remaining estimated useful lives 
over the prior three years  the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial 
occidental s net property  plant and equipment for chemicals is approximately billion and its annual depreciation expense is expected to be approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense 
for example  a reduction in the remaining useful lives of percent would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million per year 
environmental liabilities and expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss  occidental refers to currently available information  including relevant past experience  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
the environmental reserves are based on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available 
for the years ended december  and  occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets 
recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable 
environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable 
the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established 
many factors could result in changes to occidental s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss 
the most significant are the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate 
modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results 
occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective 
such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater  or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results 
should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives  more intensive or costly measures may be required 
the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction 
site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates  anomalies in subsurface geology  interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones  or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources 
the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidental s proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action 
additionally  other events might occur that could affect occidental s future remediation costs  such as the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated 
for some sites with impacted groundwater  accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling 
migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected 
additionally  the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures 
improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation 
in particular  for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance  the development of more effective treatment technology  or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bio remediation  could significantly affect remediation costs 
laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements 
at sites involving multiple parties  occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability 
when other parties are jointly liable  the financial viability of the parties  the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating occidental s ultimate share of liability 
based on these factors  occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties  with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable  in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories category cercla or state equivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations  category oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost  and category contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 
in all three of these categories  occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities  as adjusted by recognition for any non performing parties 
in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures  which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites  occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems 
to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data  laws  regulations  technologies or engineering estimates  occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis 
if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings 
for example  if the reserve balance were to decrease by percent  occidental would record a pre tax gain of million 
if the reserve balance were to increase by percent  occidental would record an additional remediation expense of million 
other loss contingencies occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits  claims  proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations 
occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  occidental discloses  in aggregate  its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred 
occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an on going basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 
these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate 
management s judgments could change based on new information  changes in laws or regulations  changes in management s plans or intentions  the outcome of legal proceedings  settlements or other factors 
significant accounting changes listed below are significant changes in occidental s accounting principles 
sfas no 
revised in december  the fasb issued a revision to sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits to improve financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans 
the standard requires that companies provide more details about their plan assets  benefit obligations  cash flows and other relevant information  such as plan assets by category 
a description of investment policies and strategies for these asset categories and target allocation percentages or target ranges are also required in financial statements 
this statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  occidental adopted this statement in the fourth quarter of and provided the required disclosure in this report 
sfas no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for how a company classifies and measures financial instruments that have characteristics of liabilities and equity 
occidental adopted the provisions of this statement on july  as a result of the adoption  occidental s mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities are now classified as a liability and the payments to the holders of the securities  which were previously recorded as minority interest on the statement of operations  are recorded as interest expense 
on january   all of the trust preferred securities were redeemed 
sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  occidental adopted this statement in the third quarter of and it did not have a material effect on its financial statements 
fin and fin r revised in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a company to consolidate a vie if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interests 
a vie is generally defined as an entity whose equity is unable to finance its activities or whose owners lack the risks and rewards of ownership 
the statement also imposes disclosure requirements for all the vies of a company  even if the company is not the primary beneficiary 
the provisions of this statement apply at inception for any entity created after january  occidental adopted the provisions of this interpretation for its existing entities on april   which resulted in the consolidation of its oxymar investment 
as a result of the oxymar consolidation  assets increased by million and liabilities increased by million 
there was no material effect on net income as a result of the consolidation 
in september  marubeni indicated it would exercise its option to put its interest in oxymar to occidental by paying approximately million to occidental 
in connection with the transfer  which is expected to be complete in april  occidental will assume marubeni s guarantee of oxymar s debt 
as all the oxymar debt is already consolidated in occidental s financial statements with the adoption of fin  the exercise of the put will not have a material effect on occidental s financial position or results of operations 
see off balance sheet arrangements elk hills power for information on vies where occidental is not the primary beneficiary 
in december  the fasb revised fin to exempt certain entities from its requirements and to clarify certain issues arising during the initial implementation of fin occidental will adopt the revised interpretation in the first quarter of and it is not expected to have an impact on the financial statements when adopted 
fin in january  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a company to recognize a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
this liability would be recorded at the inception of a guarantee and would be measured at fair value 
fin also requires certain disclosures related to guarantees  which are included in note occidental adopted the measurement provisions of this statement in the first quarter of and it did not have an effect on the financial statements when adopted 
eitf issue no 
in the third quarter of  occidental adopted certain provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
these provisions prescribed significant changes in how revenue from energy trading is recorded 
historically  occidental had two major types of oil and gas revenues revenues from its equity production  and revenues from the sale of oil and gas produced by other companies  but purchased and resold by occidental  referred to as revenue from trading activities 
both types of sales involve physical deliveries and had been historically recorded on a gross basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
with the adoption of eitf issue no 
 occidental now reflects the revenue from trading activities on a net basis 
there were no changes in gross margins  net income  cash flow or earnings per share for any period as a result of adopting this requirement 
however  net sales and cost of sales were reduced by equal and offsetting amounts to reflect the adoption of this requirement 
for the years ended december  and  net sales and cost of sales were reduced from amounts previously reported by approximately billion representing amounts for the first two quarters of and billion  respectively  to conform to the current presentation 
since  occidental has accounted for certain energy trading contracts in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
eitf issue no 
required that all energy trading contracts must be marked to fair value with gains and losses included in earnings  whether the contracts were derivatives or not 
in october  the eitf rescinded eitf issue no 
thus precluding mark to market accounting for all energy trading contracts that are not derivatives and fair value accounting for inventories purchased from third parties 
also  the rescission requires derivative gains and losses to be presented net on the income statement  whether or not they are physically settled  if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes 
occidental adopted this accounting change in the first quarter of and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles charge of approximately million  after tax 
sfas no 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for exit and disposal costs only when the liability has been incurred and when it can be measured at fair value 
the statement is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  occidental adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of and it did not have a material effect on its financial statements 
sfas no 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
in addition to amending or rescinding other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions  sfas no 
precludes companies from recording gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item 
occidental implemented sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of and all comparative financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
since occidental had no extraordinary items  there was no effect on the presentation 
the effects of the statement on prior years include the reclassification of an extraordinary loss to net income from continuing operations of million per share in there was no effect on net income or basic earnings per common share upon adoption 
sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
under sfas no 
 companies are required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred if there is a legal obligation to dismantle the asset and reclaim or remediate the property at the end of the useful life 
occidental adopted sfas no 
in the first quarter of the initial adoption resulted in an after tax charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
the adoption increased net property  plant and equipment by million  increased asset retirement obligations by million and decreased deferred tax liabilities by million 
the pro forma asset retirement obligation  if the adoption of this statement had occurred on january   would have been million at january  and million at december  sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changes the accounting and reporting requirements for acquired goodwill and intangible assets 
the provisions of this statement are applied to companies starting with fiscal years beginning after december  at december   the balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets with annual amortization expense of approximately million recorded in each of the years income statements for the three year period ended december  as a result  elimination of goodwill amortization would not have had a material impact on net income or earnings per share of any of the years presented and  as a result  the transitional disclosures of adjusted net income excluding goodwill amortization described by sfas no 
have not been presented 
upon implementation of sfas no 
in the first quarter of  three separate specialty chemical businesses were identified as separate reporting units and tested for goodwill impairment 
all three of these businesses are components of the chemical segment 
the fair value of each of the three reporting units was determined through third party appraisals 
the appraisals determined fair value to be the price that the assets could be sold for in a current transaction between willing parties 
as a result of the impairment testing  occidental recorded a cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles after tax reduction in net income of approximately million due to the impairment of all the goodwill attributed to these reporting units 
sfas no 
on january   occidental adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
this statement established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and required an entity to recognize derivatives on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the derivative instrument s fair value must be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
adoption of this new accounting standard resulted in cumulative after tax reductions in net income of approximately million and other comprehensive income oci of approximately million in the first quarter of the adoption also increased total assets by million and total liabilities by million as of january  intangible assets the eitf currently is deliberating on eitf no 
o  whether mineral rights are tangible or intangible assets and eitf no 
s application of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to oil and gas companies 
these proposed statements will determine whether contract based oil and gas mineral rights are classified as tangible or intangible assets based on the eitf s interpretation of sfas no 
and sfas no 
historically  occidental has classified all of its contract based mineral rights within property  plant and equipment and has generally not identified these amounts separately 
if the eitf determines that these mineral rights should be presented as intangible assets  occidental would have to reclassify its contract based oil and gas mineral rights acquired after june  to intangible assets and make additional disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
if occidental adopted this change  approximately million and million of the property  plant and equipment balance would be reclassified to intangible assets at december  and  respectively 
these amounts  which are net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  include approximately million and million of mineral rights related to proved properties at december  and  respectively 
occidental has been amortizing these amounts under the unit of production method and would continue to amortize the mineral rights under this method 
based on its understanding of the scope of the eitf deliberations  occidental believes the adoption of this potential decision would have no material effect on its results of operations 
derivative activities and market risk general occidental s market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
occidental periodically enters into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations 
a derivative is a financial instrument which derives its value from another instrument or variable 
in general  the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 
accounting for derivatives and definitions occidental applies either fair value or cash flow hedge accounting when transactions meet specified criteria to obtain hedge accounting treatment 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss is immediately recognized in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative is either recognized in income with an offsetting adjustment to the basis of the item being hedged for fair value hedges  or deferred in oci to the extent the hedge is effective for cash flow hedges 
a hedge is regarded as highly effective and qualifies for hedge accounting if  at inception and throughout its life  it is expected that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item are almost fully offset by the changes in the fair value or changes in cash flows of the hedging instrument and actual effectiveness is within a range of percent to percent 
in the case of hedging a forecasted transaction  the transaction must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect reported net profit or loss 
occidental discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge  when the derivative expires  or is sold  terminated  or exercised  when the hedged item matures or is sold or repaid  or when a forecasted transaction is no longer deemed highly probable 
commodity price risk general occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
based on current levels of production  if oil prices vary overall by per barrel  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income before us income tax 
if natural gas prices vary by per mcf  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income before us income tax 
if production levels change in the future  the sensitivity of occidental s results to oil and gas prices also would change 
occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices 
if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million and million  respectively  annual effect on income before us income taxes 
if pvc prices vary by 
lb  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income before us income taxes 
if edc prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million annual effect on income before us income taxes 
historically  price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes  therefore  the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated 
according to chemical market associates  inc  december average contract prices were chlorine ton  caustic soda ton  pvc lb and edc ton 
marketing and trading operations occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas 
derivatives are also used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows 
occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization  which operates under established policy controls and procedures 
with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations  occidental utilizes a combination of futures  forwards  options and swaps to offset various physical transactions 
overall  occidental has a low level of involvement in the hedging of long term oil and gas prices and its use of derivatives in hedging activity remains at a correspondingly low level 
in september  occidental unwound its natural gas delivery commitment and corresponding natural gas price swap which were entered into in november occidental recognized a pre tax loss of million related to these transactions 
risk management occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying  selling  marketing  trading  and hedging activities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy 
the chief financial officer and risk management committee  comprising members of occidental s management  oversee these controls  which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer 
the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities 
controls for energy commodities include limits on credit  limits on trading  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
fair value of contracts the following tables reconcile the changes in the fair value of occidental s marketing and trading contracts during and and segregate the open contracts at december  by maturity periods 
in millions a fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year losses gains on changes on contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions gains losses on other changes in fair values fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year a amounts have been reclassified to conform to current presentation 
maturity periods total source of to to and fair fair value thereafter value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods total the tables above include the fair value of physical positions and the fair value of the related financial instruments for trading and marketing operations 
at december  and  the physical positions were a net gain of million and million  respectively 
the value of the derivative financial instruments that offset these physical positions are a net gain of million and a net loss of million at december  and  respectively 
gains and losses are netted in the statement of operations 
on the balance sheets  except where a right of set off exists  gains are recognized as assets and losses are recognized as liabilities 
commodity hedges on a limited basis  occidental uses cash flow hedges for the sale of crude oil and natural gas production 
crude oil cash flow hedges were executed for approximately percent of total us oil production in natural gas cash flow hedges were executed for approximately percent of total us gas production 
occidental s commodity cash flow hedging instruments in were highly effective 
at december   all of these cash flow hedges had been settled 
no fair value hedges were used for oil and gas production during or and no cash flow hedges were used for the sale of production in quantitative information occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity based derivatives and commodity contracts used in trading activities 
this method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a percent level of confidence 
for non trading activities  there were no material amounts outstanding at december the value at risk for both oil and natural gas is summarized below marketing and trading value at risk for the years ended december  in millions value at risk oil high during the year low during the year average for the year value at risk natural gas high during the year low during the year average for the year interest rate risk general occidental is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates and it enters into various derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate exposure 
interest rate swaps  forward locks and futures contracts are entered into periodically as part of occidental s overall strategy 
hedging activities occidental has entered into several interest rate swaps that qualified for fair value hedge accounting 
these derivatives effectively convert approximately billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt with maturities ranging from to occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks  which qualified as cash flow hedges 
the hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant leased by occidental that was completed in december the remaining loss on the hedges through december was approximately million after tax  which is recorded in accumulated oci and is being recognized in earnings over the lease term of years on a straight line basis 
certain of occidental s equity investees have entered into additional derivative instruments that qualified as cash flow hedges 
occidental reflects its proportionate share of these cash flow hedges in oci 
tabular presentation of interest rate risk in millions of us dollars  except rates us dollar us dollar year of maturity fixed rate variable rate a grand total a thereafter   total    average interest rate fair value    a includes fixed rate debt with fair value hedges but excludes million of mark to market adjustments related to such hedges and million of unamortized debt discounts 
credit risk occidental s energy contracts are spread among numerous counterparties 
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis 
occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits  and manages credit enhancement issues 
credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances  current month activity  and forward mark to market exposure 
foreign currency risk several of occidental s foreign operations are located in countries whose currencies generally depreciate against the us dollar 
typically  effective currency forward markets do not exist for these countries 
therefore  occidental attempts to manage its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
generally  international crude oil sales are denominated in us dollars 
additionally  all of occidental s oil and gas foreign entities have the us dollar as the functional currency 
however  in one foreign chemical subsidiary where the local currency is the functional currency  occidental has exposure on us dollar denominated debt that is not material 
at december  and  occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
the effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income 
derivative and fair value disclosures the following table shows derivative financial instruments included in the consolidated balance sheets balance at december  in millions derivative financial instrument assets a current non current derivative financial instrument liabilities a current non current a amounts include energy trading contracts 
as a result of fair value hedges  the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes after tax derivative activity recorded in oci for the years ended december  in millions beginning balance losses from changes in current cash flow hedges amount reclassified to income ending balance during the next twelve months  occidental expects that approximately million of net derivative after tax losses included in oci  based on their valuation at december   will be reclassified into earnings when the hedged transactions close 
hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings for the years ended december  and selected cash flow information occidental calculates chemical segment free cash flow as segment income  adding back depreciation  depletion and amortization  and subtracting from that amount total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions 
occidental believes that free cash flow is useful to investors as an indicator of occidental s ability to generate positive cash results to service and or repay debt and generate cash for acquisitions and other investments 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures 
changes in working capital are not reflected in free cash flow  and occidental has certain non discretionary obligations  such as debt service  that are not deducted from this measure 
in addition  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
free cash flow as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
there is no comparable segment cash flow measure available under gaap 
in addition  occidental discloses cumulative net pre tax cash flows generated by particular properties  which it believes is an important indicator of cumulative life to date performance 
there is no comparable property level cash flow measure available under gaap 
chemical segment free cash flow is calculated as follows in millions segment earnings depreciation  depletion and amortization capital spending a free cash flow b a excludes million for the purchase of a previously leased facility in laporte  texas and million related to the exercise of purchase options for certain leased railcars 
b excludes working capital changes
