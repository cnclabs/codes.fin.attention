item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates estimates and assumptions used in its financial statements 
the company bases its estimates used on historical experience and on various other factors that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on authorized returns and historical trends in sales returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
the company often enters into agreements with its customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is the company s obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements generally may be terminated by our customers at any time  but usually are not 
warranty reserves the company s warranty reserve is established based on the company s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with the company s current understanding of the status of existing claims 
estimating the warranty reserve requires the company to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
while the company believes that its warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
the company s customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could impact the company s exposure to these costs 
bad debts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
additionally  the company reviews historical trends for collectibility in determining an estimate for its allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the last in  first out lifo method for us inventories and by the first in  first out fifo method for non us inventories 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
goodwill in connection with the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company discontinued its amortization of goodwill on january  in lieu of amortization  this standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment as of the date of adoption  at least annually thereafter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk from time to time  the company is exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  the company uses a combination of variable and fixed rate debt 
during the company repaid the entire remaining balance of its variable term debt 
this  coupled with the fact that the company s revolving facility remains undrawn  resulted in all of the company s debt at december  being fixed rate debt 
the company s risks related to commodity price and foreign currency exchange risks have historically not been material 
the company does not expect the effects of these risks to be material in the future based on current operating and economic conditions in the countries and markets in which it operates 
therefore  a change in the value of the us dollar would not significantly affect the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows
