in recent years the company has consolidated and or abandoned several facilities in an effort to improve efficiencies and operating results  and plans further consolidations 
in the event the company were to abandon a facility prior to its being leased to a new tenant  the company could become obligated for accelerated lease payments or other expenses 
facility construction obligation 
the company is currently constructing a new facility for the material handling components segment which is expected to cost approximately million 
in june  after several delays  the city of reading  pennsylvania transferred ownership of approximately acres of partially improved land the site to the company s material handling components segment for 
the transfer of the site to the company is part of a relocation incentive package 
the company is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete construction of the facility as soon as practical  and to employ approximately two hundred employees by the end of october at the site 
the company expects to occupy the facility in the second quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the company s consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimates could differ markedly from current expectations 
the company believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of its accounting policies that affect the company s financial statements impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company reviews its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company has a significant amount of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves management s judgment 
in addition  should the company conclude that recoverability of an asset is in question  the estimate of undiscounted future operating cash flows to determine whether an asset is recoverable and  if not  the final determination of the fair value of the asset are also based on the judgment of management 
these judgments can be impacted by a variety of underlying assumptions  such as the general business climate  effectiveness of competition and supply and cost of resources 
accordingly  actual results can differ significantly from the assumptions made by management in making its estimates 
future changes in management s estimates could result in indicators of impairment and future impairment charges 
valuation of inventory 
the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon obsolescence and changes in market value as permanent changes in the carrying amount of such inventory until its ultimate sale or other disposition 
the company has evaluated the current level of inventories considering historical sales and other factors and  based on this evaluation  has recorded adjustments to cost of goods sold to adjust inventory to net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer demand or competition differ from expectations 
accounts receivable 
the company performs ongoing evaluations of customers and adjusts credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and credit worthiness  as determined by credit information available at that time 
the company monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  after completion of an annual planning process  or earlier if events occur which require an impairment analysis to be performed 
with respect to each reporting unit which has any goodwill  the fair value is determined using traditional valuation methodology  and compared with its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the unit s carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired 
if the unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  assets of the unit are individually valued to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
significant management judgment is involved in determining the fair value of assets 
future changes in management s estimates could result in additional impairment charges to goodwill 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for credit carryforwards and then assessed including the anticipation of future income to determine the likelihood of realization 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
accounting for stock options 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas  allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and provide pro forma income and pro forma earnings per share disclosures for stock based awards as if the fair value based method defined in sfas had been applied 
in accordance with apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations  compensation expense would generally be recorded for fixed option grants only if  on the date of the grant  the current price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
the company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb opinion no 
and provide the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized for the company s stock option plans and award of options to non employee directors 
recent accounting pronouncements see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk relates to interest rate exposure on long term borrowings 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
excess cash is primarily used to pay down the revolving line of credit 
borrowings against the revolving line of credit and certain real estate loans are at variable interest rates 
all other borrowings are at fixed rates 
at august   the company had  of outstanding variable interest loans with interest rates varying from percent to percent  in traunches 
a one percent increase in interest rates charged on the company s outstanding variable rate borrowings would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately  assuming the total outstanding amount of variable interest debt were to remain the same as on august  at august   the company had  of outstanding variable interest loans with interest rates varying from percent to percent  in traunches 
a one percent increase in interest rates charged on the company s outstanding variable rate borrowings would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately  assuming the total outstanding amount of variable interest debt were to remain the same as on august
