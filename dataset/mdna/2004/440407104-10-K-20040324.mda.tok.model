item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation horizon bancorp and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation table dollar amounts in thousands overview horizon benefited in the first three quarters of from a very active mortgage refinance market 
the benefit came primarily in two areas mortgage loan origination and mortgage warehouse loans 
horizon originates mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market  generating a gain on sale 
refinancing activity created higher than normal volume of loans processed through the mortgage warehouse area generating interest and fee income on those loans 
numerous short term funding sources were utilized throughout the year to cover this abnormally high level of mortgage warehouse activity including fhlb debt  repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit 
total loans declined for the year due to fourth quarter fall off in mortgage refinance activity and the related decline in mortgage warehouse loans 
however  horizon was successful in growing its core lending in local markets and in the newly developed southwest michigan market which generated almost one half of the commercial loan growth 
core deposits grew at a steady rate throughout the year particularly in certificates of deposit 
critical accounting policies horizon has established various accounting policies  which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation the company s financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item on form k 
certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has identified the allowance for loan losses as a critical accounting policy 
additional discussion regarding the allowance for loan loss is included in the following analysis of financial condition and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents analysis of financial condition investment securities horizon maintains a high quality investment portfolio with low credit risk 
investment securities totaled  million at december  and consisted of u 
s 
treasury and government agency securities of million  municipal securities of million  mortgage backed securities of million  collateralized mortgage obligations of million  and corporate securities of thousand 
as indicated above  of the investment portfolio consists of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
these instruments are secured by residential mortgages of varying maturities 
principal and interest payments are received monthly as the underlying mortgages are repaid 
these payments also include prepayments of mortgage balances as borrowers either sell their homes or refinance their mortgages 
therefore  mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations have maturities that are stated in terms of average life 
the average life is the average amount of time that each dollar of principal is expected to be outstanding 
as of december   the mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations in the investment portfolio had an average life of years 
securities that have interest rates above current market rates are purchased at a premium 
these securities may experience a significant increase in prepayments when lower market interest rates create an incentive for the borrower to refinance the underlying mortgage 
this may result in a decrease of current income  however  this risk is mitigated by a shorter average life 
management currently believes that prepayment risk on these securities is nominal 
at december  and  all investment securities were classified as available for sale 
securities classified as available for sale are carried at their fair value  with both unrealized gains and losses added or subtracted  net of tax  directly to stockholders equity 
this accounting method adds potential volatility to stockholders equity  but net income is not affected unless securities are sold 
net appreciation on these securities totaled million  which resulted in a million addition  net of tax  to stockholders equity at december  this compared to a million  net of tax  addition in stockholders equity at december  as a member of the federal reserve and federal home loan bank system  horizon is required to maintain an investment in the common stock of each entity 
the investment in common stock is based on a predetermined formula 
at december   horizon has investments in the common stock of the federal reserve and federal home loan bank totaling million compared to million at december  at december   horizon does not maintain a trading account and is not using any derivative products for hedging or other purposes 

table of contents loans total loans  the principal earning asset of the bank  were million at december  the current level of loans is a decrease of from the december  level of million 
as the table below indicates  the decrease is related to a decline in mortgage warehouse loans

the bank has established rigorous underwriting standards including a policy that monitors the lending function through strict administrative and reporting requirements 
the bank uses an independent third party loan review function that regularly reviews asset quality 
real estate loans real estate loans totaled million or of total loans as of december   compared to million or of total loans as of december  this category consists of home mortgages that generally require a loan to value of no more than 
some special guaranteed or insured real estate loan programs do permit a higher loan to collateral value ratio 

table of contents in addition to the customary real estate loans described above  the bank also has outstanding on december   million in home equity lines of credit compared to million at december  credit lines normally limit the loan to collateral value to no more than 
these loans are classified as consumer loans in the table above and in note of the consolidated financial statements 
residential real estate lending is a highly competitive business 
as of december   the real estate loan portfolio reflected a wide range of interest rates and repayment patterns  but could generally be categorized as follows amount percent of portfolio yield amount percent of portfolio yield fixed rate monthly payment biweekly payment adjustable rate monthly payment biweekly payment total during  and approximately million and million respectively of residential mortgages were originated for sale into the secondary market 
these loan sales  also caused a decrease in the bank s portfolio of residential mortgage loans as a portion of portfolio loans were refinanced and sold into the secondary market 
horizon anticipates that the volume of mortgage loan activity will decline in as mortgage refinance activity subsides 
this will negatively affect the gain on sale of loans  but should have little impact on mortgage loans outstanding 
in addition to the real estate loan portfolio  the bank sells real estate loans and retains the servicing rights 
loans serviced for others are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the unpaid principal balances and number of loans serviced for others totaled approximately  and  and  and  at december  and the bank began capitalizing mortgage servicing rights during and the aggregate fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights at december  totaled approximately  comparable market values and a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows were used to estimate fair value 
for purposes of measuring impairment  risk characteristics including product type  investor type  and interest rates  were used to stratify the originated mortgage servicing rights

table of contents commercial loans commercial loans totaled million or of total loans as of december   compared to million or as of december  approximately one half of this growth came in the southwest michigan market where horizon began originating loans in february of commercial loans consisted of the following types of loans at december number amount percent of portfolio number amount percent of portfolio sba guaranteed loans municipal government lines of credit real estate and equipment term loans total consumer loans consumer loans totaled  million or of total loans as of december   compared to million or as of december  the total consumer loan portfolio increased in the growth in consumer loans resulted from an increase in the number of automobile dealers from whom horizon buys loans 
growth also came in home equity lines of credit through increased marketing and a more competitive product 
mortgage warehouse loans in november  horizon began a mortgage warehousing program 
horizon enters into agreements with mortgage companies and purchases  at its discretion  mortgage loans from mortgage companies at par  net of certain fees  and later sells them back to the mortgage companies at the same amount and without recourse provisions 
interest income is recorded based upon a rate of interest tied to the prime rate during the funding period  not the rates on the individual note 
such loans are made to individuals and reviewed  prior to purchase  for evidence that the loans are of secondary market quality and meet horizon s internal underwriting guidelines 
an assignment of the mortgage to horizon is required 
in addition  horizon takes possession of the original note and forwards such note to the end investor 
in the event that the end investor would not honor this commitment and the mortgage companies would not be able to honor their repurchase obligations  horizon would then need to sell these loans in the secondary market at the fair value of these loans 
loans are typically resold within days and are seldom held more than days 
if residential mortgage loan volume declines as anticipated  the level of these loans outstanding is anticipated to be below the average amounts attained for and allowance and provision for loan losses critical accounting policy an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that involves management s ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the identification of loans that may have potential losses is subjective  therefore  a general reserve is maintained to cover all potential losses within the entire loan portfolio 
horizon utilizes a loan grading system that helps identify  monitor  and address asset quality problems  in an adequate and timely manner 
each quarter  various factors affecting the quality of the loan portfolio are reviewed 
large credits are reviewed on an individual basis for loss potential 
other loans are reviewed as a group based upon previous trends of loss experience 
horizon also reviews the current and anticipated economic conditions of its lending market as well as transaction risk to determine the effect they may have on the loss experience of the loan portfolio 
the methodology described above is consistent with the office of the comptroller of the currency s guidance in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans outstanding  compared to million or at december  during  the provision for loan losses totaled million compared to million in the allowance as a percent of total loans increased due to the decline in total loans and is somewhat above peers 
this increase is justified as the mix of the loan portfolio shifted away from residential mortgage loans to a higher concentration of commercial and consumer loans which traditionally carry a higher degree of risk 
however  no assurance can be given that horizon will not  in any particular period  sustain loan losses that are significant in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and management s ongoing quarterly assessments of the portfolio  will not require increases in the allowance for loan losses 
horizon considers the allowance for loan losses to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of december  nonperforming loans nonperforming loans are defined as loans that are greater than days delinquent or have had the accrual of interest discontinued by management 
management continues to work diligently toward returning nonperforming loans to an earning asset basis 
nonperforming loans for the previous three years ending december are as follows nonperforming loans nonperforming loans total of the allowance for loan losses at december  compared to and of the allowance for loan losses on december  and  respectively 
a loan becomes impaired when  based on current information  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is classified as impaired  the degree of impairment must be recognized by estimating future cash flows from the debtor 
the present value of these cash flows is computed at a discount rate based on the interest rate contained in the loan agreement 
however  if a particular loan has a determinable market value  the creditor may use that value 
also  if the loan is secured and considered collateral dependent  the creditor may use the fair value of the collateral 
smaller balance  homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total 
such loans include residential first mortgage loans secured by family residences  residential construction loans  automobile  home equity  second mortgage loans  and mortgage warehouse loans 
commercial loans and mortgage loans secured by other properties are evaluated individually for impairment 
when analysis of borrower operating results and financial condition indicate that underlying cash flows of a borrower s business are not adequate to meet its debt service requirements  the loan is evaluated for impairment 
often this is associated with a delay or shortfall in payments of days or more 
loans are generally moved to nonaccrual status when days or more past due 
these loans are often considered impaired 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 

table of contents other real estate owned oreo net of any related allowance for oreo losses for the previous three years ending december are as follows other real estate owned deposits the primary source of funds for the bank comes from the acceptance of demand and time deposits 
however  at times the bank will use its ability to borrow funds from the federal home loan bank when it can do so at interest rates and terms that are superior to those required for deposited funds 
total deposits were million at december  compared to million at december  or an increase of 
average deposits and rates by category for the pervious three years ended december are as follows average balance outstanding for the year ended december average rate paid for the year ended december noninterest bearing demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits money market time deposits total deposits horizon continually revises and enhances its interest bearing consumer and commercial demand deposit products based on local market conditions and its need for funding to support various types of assets 
these product changes caused the increases in the average balances as displayed in the table above

the plan is a comprehensive strategic plan to broaden and improve the market for horizon s common stock with local community investors who have a long term  personal interest in helping horizon remain an independent community bank 
it includes improved communications with shareholders and customers as well as efforts to improve the marketability of its common stock 
during the fourth quarter of  two important components of the shareholder value plan were completed 
these included a three for one stock split and the listing of horizon s stock on the nasdaq smallcap market

retirement plans on july   the board of directors of horizon bancorp authorized the termination of the horizon bancorp employee stock ownership plan esop 
this decision was based upon a thorough financial analysis of the impact this plan has had on the earnings and capital of horizon since its inception and the expected future impact retaining this plan would likely have on horizon 
on december   the debt owed by the esop was repaid with the proceeds from the sale of a portion of the unallocated shares to horizon bancorp 
the remaining shares for all active participants were allocated to participants 
the termination of the esop resulted in an expense of million for the remaining shares in the esop plan were transferred to the stock bonus plan 
prior to horizon s stock being listed on nasdaq smallcap  the market value of the shares held in horizon s stock bonus plan was classified outside of shareholders equity 
since the shares in the stock bonus plan are now readily tradeable  horizon reclassified the stock bonus plan equity to shareholders equity at december  the retirement plans of horizon own approximately of the outstanding shares at december

in march of  horizon formed horizon statutory trust trust 
the trust is a statutory business trust and is wholly owned by horizon 
the trust issued million of trust preferred capital securities as a participant in a pooled trust preferred securities offering 
horizon issued subordinated debentures aggregating million to the trust 
the junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the trust 
the junior subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities pay interest and dividends  respectively  on a quarterly basis 
the junior subordinated debentures and the securities bear interest at a rate of day libor plus and mature on march  and are non callable for five years and  after that period  the securities may be called at any quarterly interest payment date at par 
the trust preferred capital securities  subject to certain limitations  are included in tier capital for regulatory purposes 
distributions on the trust preferred capital securities are recorded as interest expense 
costs associated with the issuance of the securities totaling thousand were capitalized and are being amortized to the first call date of the securities 
the bank purchases home mortgages from mortgage companies under warehouse agreements whereby the mortgage company has the right to repurchase the loan 
because these transactions are sales of the loans to the bank and the bank is the owner of the purchased loans  the bank has historically treated these loans as home mortgage loans for call report and regulatory capital purposes 
during the course of the routine  periodic examination by bank regulatory authorities commenced in february  the examination personnel raised the issue of whether the bank s mortgage warehouse loans should be treated as other loans rather than as home mortgage loans for call report purposes 
if these mortgage loans were treated as other loans  it would change the calculations for risk based capital and reduce the bank s risk based capital ratios 
the following table shows  for year ends in  and the amount of the bank s risk based and tier capital ratios as reported and as they would be under this alternative treatment 
table of contents horizon bank and horizon bancorp as of reported alternative treatment minimum required to be well capitalized december  total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to average assets consolidated n a bank december  total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to average assets consolidated n a bank december  total capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to risk weighted assets consolidated n a bank tier capital to average assets consolidated n a bank if the bank is required to reclassify such loans  the bank still meets the regulatory well capitalized standards for all of and bank regulators have not issued a final opinion on this matter but management continues to believe that these loans are properly characterized for risk based capital purposes 
however there is no assurance that the regulators will concur with that determination 
if required to treat mortgage warehouse loans as commercial loans  the bank will consider increasing the amount of its capital through the issuance of subordinated debt  trust preferred securities or equity securities  or consider other alternatives 
as of december   management is not aware of any other recommendations by banking regulatory authorities  which  if they were to be implemented  would have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on horizon s liquidity  capital resources  or operations

the years and saw a relatively stable rate environment after unprecedented declines in interest rates in horizon continued to experience lower loan yields as new loans and loan renewals came on at lower rates than those maturing or paying off 
much of the growth in average loans outstanding came in mortgage warehouse loans which averaged million in compared to million in and million at year end mortgage warehouse loans peaked at over million in july of the additional volume related to refinance of conforming residential mortgage loans which carry a lower rate than non conforming sub prime loans carried in the mortgage warehouse portfolio 
so while the volume increased in the mortgage warehouse area  the yield declined 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of mortgage warehouse lending 
the investment portfolio was increased during  particularly late in the year as mortgage warehouse volume declined 
new investments came on at current market rates which are lower than those on investments which were purchased prior to horizon also lowered its deposit rates in and  however  due to the already low rates paid and competitive pressures it is difficult to lower short term deposit rates any further 
the increase in net interest income during and is primarily the result of increased loan volume  particularly in the mortgage warehouse area and partially offset by a decrease in net interest margin in 
table of contents noninterest income the major components of noninterest income consist of service charges on deposit accounts  gain on sale of loans and fiduciary fees 
service charges on deposit accounts are based upon a recovery of direct operating expenses associated with providing the service  b allowing for a profit margin that provides an adequate return on assets and stockholders equity  and c competitive factors within the bank s markets 
service charges on deposits were million  million and million  for  and  respectively 
the increase in service charges in is the result of a new overdraft protection product  offered to certain qualified deposit customers 
gain on sale of loans was million for compared to million in and million for horizon sells approximately of its residential mortgage loan production to the secondary market 
during horizon sold million of the million of loans originated into the secondary market generating the gain indicated 
this compares to million current year production of loans sold in and million in the gain amount includes approximately thousand gain on the sale of portfolio loans while the gain amount includes approximately thousand gain on the sale of portfolio loans 
the amount also includes approximately thousand of gain on the sale of credit card loans 
portfolio mortgage loans were sold to reduce the interest rate risk related to long term fixed rate assets and to provide funding for the growth in other loan areas 
the credit card loans were sold to reduce the credit risk  eliminate the inefficiencies related to managing a small portfolio and to provide funding for other loan categories 
horizon anticipates that the volume of mortgage loan activity will decline in as mortgage refinance activity subsides 
this will negatively effect the gain on sale of loans 
fiduciary fees were million in compared to million in and million in the fluctuations are primarily due to changes in the market value of assets under administration 
during the third and fourth quarter of  approximately million of investment securities were sold at a loss of thousand 
the funds generated by these sales were reinvested in securities with higher yields and similar average lives 
the loss will be recovered in approximately months through increased earnings on the replacement securities 
other income includes wire transfer fees charged primarily to mortgage warehouse customers and fees collected on sub prime loans originated by horizon  but funded by third parties 
the increase in over resulted from the additional volume in these activities 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in salaries and benefits increased during compared to an increase of during the increase for and was caused primarily by increases in incentive compensation due to company performance and commissions paid to mortgage originators 
total other expenses  excluding salaries and benefits  increased in and in the primary factors effecting were increased occupancy related to a new facility in chesterton  indiana  which replaced an existing facility  and new facilities in the southwest michigan market  decreased data processing costs related to the credit card portfolio which was sold during  professional fees increased related to rewriting horizon s articles of association and by laws which were adopted at the may shareholders meeting  outside services increased due in part to maintaining guards at certain branch locations  and loan expense increased due to the additional volume of loans originated 
the primary factors causing the increase in were approximately thousand for processing services related to the new overdraft protection product  thousand write off of goodwill related to horizon s insurance agency 
horizon adopted sfas on january  an initial test for goodwill impairment was performed which compared the fair value of the insurance agency to its 
table of contents carrying value 
market values for comparable agencies  as well as other factors  were used as a basis for determining the fair value of the insurance agency 
as a result of this testing  horizon recorded an impairment loss on goodwill of thousand thousand after tax as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of during the third quarter of  it was determined that further impairment of the goodwill related to the insurance agency existed 
this was based on offers received while attempting to market the commercial and group health and life  lines of business of the insurance agency 
therefore  a second impairment test was conducted and a further write down of goodwill related to the insurance agency was taken as a charge to other expense of thousand 
this reduced to zero the carrying value of goodwill related to the insurance agency 
the remaining goodwill relates to horizon trust and investment management 
income taxes income tax expense  before cumulative effect of change in accounting for goodwill  totaled million in  million in and million in the effective tax rate was   and for   and  respectively 
the declines in the effective tax rate are caused by increased tax exempt investment income 
liquidity and rate sensitivity management management and the board of directors meet regularly to review both the liquidity and rate sensitivity position of horizon 
effective asset and liability management ensures horizon s ability to monitor the cash flow requirements of depositors along with the demands of borrowers and to measure and manage interest rate risk 
horizon utilizes an interest rate risk assessment model designed to highlight sources of existing interest rate risk and consider the effect of these risks on strategic planning 
management maintains within certain parameters an essentially balanced ratio of interest sensitive assets to liabilities in order to protect against the effects of wide interest rate fluctuations 
liquidity the bank maintains a stable base of core deposits provided by long standing relationships with consumers and local businesses 
these deposits are the principal source of liquidity for horizon 
other sources of liquidity for horizon include earnings  loan repayments  investment security sales and maturities  sale of real estate loans and borrowing relationships with correspondent banks  including the federal home loan bank fhlb 
at december   horizon has available approximately million in available credit from various money center banks  including the fhlb 
during  cash flows were generated primarily from an increase in deposits of million and a decrease in loans of million 
cash flows were used for a million increase in investment securities and a million reduction in federal home loan bank advances 
the net cash and cash equivalent position increased by million during interest sensitivity the degree by which net interest income may fluctuate due to changes in interest rates is monitored by horizon using computer simulation models  incorporating not only the current gap position but the effect of expected repricing of specific financial assets and liabilities 
when repricing opportunities are not properly aligned  net interest income may be affected when interest rates change 
forecasting results of the possible outcomes determines the exposure to interest rate risk inherent in horizon s balance sheet 
the goal is to manage imbalanced positions that arise when the total amount of assets that reprice or maturing in a given time period differs significantly from liabilities that reprice or mature in the same time period 
the theory behind managing the difference between repricing assets and liabilities is to have more assets repricing in a rising rate environment and more liabilities repricing in a declining rate environment 
at december   the amount of assets that reprice within one year were approximately of the amount of liabilities that reprice within the same time period 
this compares to at december

these interest bearing accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal 
however  horizon considers approximately of these deposits to be insensitive to gradual changes in interest rates and generally to behave like deposits with longer maturities based upon historical experience 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk horizon s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk irr is the risk that horizon s earnings and capital will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
the primary approach to irr management is one that focuses on adjustments to the asset liability mix in order to limit the magnitude of irr 
horizon s exposure to interest rate risk is due to repricing or mismatch risk  embedded options risk  and yield curve risk 
repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequence from a change in interest rates that arise because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes affect horizon s assets and liabilities 
basis risk is the risk that the spread  or rate difference  between instruments of similar maturities will change 
options risk arises whenever products give the customer the right  but not the obligation  to alter the quantity or timing of cash flows 
yield curve risk is the risk that changes in prevailing interest rates will affect instruments of different maturities by different amounts 
horizon s objective is to remain reasonably neutral with respect to irr 
horizon utilizes a variety of strategies to maintain this position including the sale of mortgage loans on the secondary market and varying maturities of fhlb advances  certificates of deposit funding  and investment securities 

table of contents the table  which follows  provides information about horizon s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the table incorporates horizon s internal system generated data related to the maturity and repayment withdrawal of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for loans  securities  and liabilities with contractual maturities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by contractual maturities as well as the historical experience of horizon related to the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the prepayment of residential loans and mortgage backed securities 
from a risk management perspective  horizon believes that repricing dates are more relevant than contractual maturity dates when analyzing the value of financial instruments 
for deposits with no contractual maturity dates  the table presents principal cash flows and weighted average rate  as applicable  based upon horizon s experience and management s judgment concerning the most likely withdrawal behaviors
