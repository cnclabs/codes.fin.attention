the continuation of these payments  the amount of such dividends  and the form in which the dividends are paid cash or stock depend on many factors  including the results of operations and the financial condition of the company 
subject to these qualifications  the company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis 
our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores 
the required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store  geographic location  degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues 
over the past three fiscal years  our new store investment has averaged approximately million per location 
this excludes new store inventory of approximately  a portion of which is financed by our vendors  and pre opening expenses  which have averaged approximately  per store over the past three fiscal years

net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
absent any significant cash acquisition or change in status of the company s outstanding zero coupon convertible bond issue  we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by cash generated from operations 
we continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the company s needs and market conditions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 
we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
insurance and self insurance reserves the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability insurance  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost was determined using the last in  first out lifo method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
under the lifo method  the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased 
as a result  the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory 
the excess of estimated current costs over lifo carrying value  or lifo reserve  was approximately million and million at september  and september   respectively 
costs for the balance of inventories are determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
cost was determined using the retail method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost to retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates  including shrinkage  which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
cost was determined using the item cost method for approximately and of inventories in fiscal years and  respectively 
this method involves counting each item in inventory  assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs net of vendor allowances of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold 
the item cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting 
we believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk that inventory values would be materially misstated 
goodwill and intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
we determine fair value utilizing both a market value 
table of contents method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment 
our evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results
