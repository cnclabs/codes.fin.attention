eit f no 
was effective for revenue arrangements entered into in reportin g periods beginning after june  and was adopted by us effective july our revenue is comprised of subscription  capital sale  and servic e contract and transaction components  described as follows subscription revenue contracts are primarily with brokerage firms international banks and global exchanges trading in equities and or derivatives subscription revenue contracts are for providing equipment and services and fo r use of our nyfix network  with an initial term of generally one to three year s with automatic renewal periods unless we receive prior written notice o f cancellation 
additional services  provided under schedules  or addendums to th e contract  are either co terminus with the original contract or have provision s similar to the original contract 
under the terms of the subscription contract s and addendums  customers typically contract for a flat periodic charge afte r initial installation and acceptance 
the revenue related to these contracts i s recognized over the term of the contract  or addendum  on a straight line basis we also include within our subscription revenue  telecommunication and othe r charges  which we provide to the customer at cost plus a normal profit 
suc h revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
as we have no history o f significant cancellations  we do not record a reserve for cancellations 
capital sale revenue  which is comprised of software and capital equipmen t sales  is generated primarily by sales to customers in the futures  options an d currencies trading market or to those customers who typically acquire license s in perpetuity  and is recognized upon shipment of the product and acceptance b y the customer 
capital sale revenue is recognized in accordance with sop described above 
as we have no history of significant sales returns o r allowances  we do not record a reserve for sales returns and allowances 
service contract revenue  which is comprised of maintenance contracts fo r subscription equipment and software and capital equipment  is recognized ove r the contract period on a straight line basis 
service contracts for subscriptio n equipment are generally co terminus with the subscription contract 
servic e contracts for software and capital equipment  typically characterized as a percentage of the original capital sale contract  are generally for an initia l term of one to three years with automatic renewal periods unless we receiv e prior written notice of cancellation 
certain service contracts provide fo r invoicing in advance of the service being performed  generally quarterly

transaction revenue consists of per share fees charged to customers wh o send and receive a match and execution in our ats order matching system customers to whom we provide execution and smart order routing technology an d gateways to access markets in their own name  a third party give u p name  or our name 
revenue on these contracts is generally invoiced monthl y in arrears or is extracted from the clearing process within three days of th e trade date and recognized in the period in which it is earned 
certai n transaction revenue contracts  which include multiple deliverables  or othe r types of our revenue are accounted for in accordance with eitf  describe d above 
some of these contracts have minimum volume commitments or are invoice d at a minimum transaction based fee 
the arrangement consideration is allocate d to each element based on the relative fair values of each element 
we accoun t for each element of an arrangement with multiple deliverables separately 
vendo r specific objective evidence for fair value of services is primarily determine d by reference to renewal pricing 
revenue on contracts invoiced in advance of the services being performe d is deferred and recognized as revenue over the period earned and is included i n deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets 
shipping  handling an d installation charges  if any  are generally invoiced to a customer and ar e included in revenue upon completion of the installation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivable s and a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimat e realization of receivables  including the current credit worthiness of eac h customer 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losse s resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if th e financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a n impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may b e required 
the collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specifi c customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptc y filings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due  t o reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will b e collected 
for all other customers  we estimate a reserve for bad debts base d upon applying certain percentages  based on historical loss trends  to certai n accounts receivable aging categories  net of accounts receivable for whic h revenue recognition has been deferred 
if circumstances change ie  highe r than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a majo r customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates o f the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
in the fourth quarter of  a discussion intensified around tradin g rules and other issues at the nyse 
nyse management changes and proposed rul e changes at the exchange caused nyfix management to become concerned with certai n customer groups and certain individual customers whose economic viability coul d become challenged if such proposed rules were adopted 
to increase our immediat e cash position and to reduce our exposure to these customers going forward  w e initiated an aggressive program to accelerate the collection of past du e accounts receivable through  among other things  the issuance of discounts t o certain customers 
as a primary result of this program  we reduced account s receivable during the fourth quarter of by million and recorded a provision of million for these discounts and other allowances 
th e allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at decembe r  and  respectively 
the provision for doubtful accounts was million and million for and  respectively 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight lin e method over its estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such a s technological advances  changes to our business model or changes in the capital nyfix  inc 
strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initia l estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of long live d asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of th e estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
goodwill net assets of companies we acquired have been recorded at their fair valu e at the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents acquisition costs in excess o f the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we adopted th e fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwil l and other intangible assets effective january  the provisions of sfa s no 
require that we allocate our goodwill to our various reporting units determine the carrying value of those businesses  and estimate the fair value o f the reporting units so that a two step goodwill impairment test can b e performed 
our reporting units represent components of our operating segment s and are the same as the reportable segments identified in note to th e consolidated financial statements 
in the first step of the goodwill impairmen t test  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and n o further testing is performed 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the n the second step must be performed  and the implied fair value of the reportin g unit s goodwill must be determined and compared to the carrying value of th e goodwill for the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment loss equal to th e difference is recorded 
in the absence of circumstances requiring impairmen t testing on a quarterly or other more frequent basis  our annual impairmen t testing date is the beginning of our fourth quarter  which is october for th e years ended december  and  there was no indication of impairmen t for either our transaction services segment or our technology services segment our two reporting units 
the present value of the discounted future cash flow s of each segment supported their carrying values as of october   the dat e of our annual impairment analysis 
however  the excess of the discounted futur e cash flows above the carrying value of our technology services segment wa s marginal at that date 
our projected cash flows for and beyond ar e sufficient to support our technology services segment goodwill carrying value however  if we are not profitable and do not have sufficient cash flows fro m operations in related to our technology services segment  our technolog y services segment goodwill may become partially or completely impaired 
if ou r goodwill were to become impaired  the resulting write down could have a materia l impact on our consolidated financial statements 
product enhancement costs costs incurred in the research  design and development of software fo r sale to others as a separate product or embedded in a product and sold as par t of the product as a whole are charged to expense until technological feasibilit y is established 
thereafter  software development costs  consisting primarily o f payroll and related costs  purchased materials and services and software to b e used within our products  which significantly enhance the marketability o r significantly extend the life of our products are capitalized  and amortized t o cost of revenue on a straight line basis over three years  beginning when th e products are offered for sale or when the enhancements are integrated into th e product 
we are required to use professional judgment in determining whethe r product enhancement costs meet the criteria for immediate expense o r capitalization  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs o f computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
we are als o required to use professional judgment in determining whether the unamortize d capitalized cost of each product enhancement approximates the net realizabl e value of such products 
nyfix  inc 
long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets  including property an d equipment  intangible assets  investments and other long term amounts due fro m unconsolidated affiliates  and capitalized product enhancement costs fo r impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amoun t may not be fully recoverable 
if such an event or circumstances occurs  th e related estimated fair value of the assets would be compared to the carryin g amount  and if needed  we would record an impairment to the extent by which th e carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we test intangible asset s with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value methodolog y such as discounted cash flows 
there was no impairment of our long lived asset s recorded for the years ended december   and income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accountin g for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets an d liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have bee n included in the financial statements or tax returns using presently enacte d income tax rates 
our deferred tax assets were recorded to the extent we believ e there will be sufficient future taxable income to utilize those assets prior t o their expiration 
to the extent we were unable to utilize deferred tax assets we would record a valuation allowance against the unrealizable amount  an d record a charge against operating results 
as of december  and  n o valuation allowance was required  as we believe it more likely than not that th e deferred tax assets will be realized 
due to ever changing tax laws and incom e tax rates  significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rat e expected to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future we must also make estimates about the sufficiency of taxable income in futur e periods to offset any deductions related to deferred tax assets currentl y recorded 
while we expect to be profitable and generate taxable income in to fully utilize our deferred tax asset  if we are not profitable and do no t generate taxable income  we may not be able to support our assumption that it i s more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and we may b e required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if ou r lack of profitability and resulting valuation allowance were sufficiently large the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
contingencies contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimat e loss will exceed the recorded provision 
we use outside counsel to assist us i n various matters including regulations  acquisitions  trademark  patent personnel and other matters 
we rely on the professional judgment of outsid e counsel as well as our own assessment in determining whether contingencie s should be recorded 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation for employees under th e recognition and measurement provisions of the accounting principles boar d apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and relate d interpretations and have elected the disclosure only alternative under sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based compensation cos t was included in our operating results for the years ended december  and for our stock option plans  as all options granted during thes e years had an exercise price equal to the market value of our stock on the dat e of grant 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock base d compensation transition and disclosure  we will continue to disclose th e required pro forma information in the notes to the consolidated financia l statements

our technology services segment revenue increased million  or  t o million in as compared to million in our traditiona l equity products subscription and service contract revenue increased to million in from million in this million increase wa s primarily attributable to higher average revenue per customer 
our averag e annual revenue per customer was  in  as compared to  i n at december   we had traditional equity customers  up from at the beginning of the year 
while we added new customers during  w e lost customers  equating to a turnover rate 
this turnover was mainl y attributable to our customers ceasing operations and or merging with othe r customers 
in august  we began an initiative to sell circuits to buy sid e institutions in order to leverage our nyfix network in various ways 
as o f december   we had executed agreements with customers initiall y requesting basic broker connectivity valued at approximately million if full y implemented 
in  we recognized million of revenue attributed to the buy side circuits installed by the end of the year 
in  we expect revenu e related to our buy side initiatives to increase throughout the year 
i n addition  in  revenues attributable to our javelin products increased million  to million in from million in  as we had full yea r javelin revenues as compared to nine months in as a result of ou r acquisition of javelin at the end of the first quarter in while we had a nominal amount of revenue in from our renaissance products  we believe tha t with our acquisition of renaissance  we will be able to more effectively compet e for customers who are consolidating their nasdaq and listed trading desks an d desire to migrate to one platform 
in addition  we believe we continue t o realize the synergies as expected with our javelin and renaissance acquisition s and will effectively compete for customers in this increase in revenue for our technology services segment includes an increase of millio n for intercompany revenues on subscription products provided to transactio n services segment customers  which are eliminated in consolidation 
as a percentage of total revenue  our technology services segment decreased to i n from in our transaction services segment revenue increased million  or to million in as compared to million in our broker deale r subsidiaries  nyfix transaction services and nyfix millennium operated for th e entire year in nyfix transaction services did not begin generating revenu e until july  and we consolidated nyfix millennium upon acquisition of a n ownership interest in february  thus our broker dealer subsidiarie s generated revenue for six and eleven months  respectively in nyfi x clearing began clearing trades in november  and had only intercompan y revenue  which had been eliminated in consolidation 
our transaction service s customer base doubled during from at december  to a t december  averaging for the year  with average revenue per customer o f  in this average annualized revenue per customer decreased fro m  per customer in the first quarter of to  in the fourt h quarter of the decrease in average revenue per customer during wa s attributed to a decrease in revenue from several large customers from whom w e generate revenue from dot flow to the nyse 
we compete with various companie s that also offer certain execution services that we view as a low margin loss leader services to our customers 
the revenue attributed to thes e customers dot flow was higher during the first half of than in the secon d half of the year as a result of lowering rates to competitively keep and protec t the on going business opportunity of any with such customers 
in  we expec t to continue to add customers at a rate similar to and expect our averag e revenue per customer to increase from our fourth quarter average due to a targeted change in the customer mix

consolidated cost of revenue increased million  or  to million in as compared to million in the primary factors fo r the increase were data center and telecommunication expense of million depreciation expense of million and product enhancement cost amortizatio n of million  which was primarily due to an increase in infrastructure an d capacity in our data centers and product enhancements costs to support ou r technology services segment  including our derivatives  renaissance and javeli n products as we integrated them with our traditional equity products and onto ou r nyfix network 
in addition  cost of revenue increased by million  which wa s attributable to execution  clearing and specialist fees related to ou r transaction services revenue  and by million for acquired intangible asse t amortization due to a full year s expense in for the nyfix millennium an d javelin acquisitions as compared to eleven months and nine months expense i n  respectively  and six months expense in for the renaissanc e acquisition 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased slightly t o in  from in  as the increase in the aforementioned technolog y services and transaction services costs offset the increase in our transactio n services revenue as mentioned below 
our technology services segment cost of revenue increased million  o r  to million in as compared to million in the increas e was primarily attributed to the aforementioned increases in allocated corporat e expenses  such as data center and telecommunications expenses  depreciation an d amortization of fixed assets and amortization of product enhancement costs an d amortization of acquired intangible assets

as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue increased t o in  from in  as the increase in the aforementioned costs gre w faster than revenue 
we expect to see a slight decrease in our cost of revenu e as a percentage of revenue in as many of the investments in property an d equipment in our data center and network infrastructure made in and should yield lower costs as a percentage of revenue

our transaction services segment cost of revenue increased million or  to million in as compared to million in i n addition to the aforementioned increase in transaction related expenses  cost o f revenue increased related to intercompany charges related to the technolog y services revenue passed through to transaction services customers  of million  which was eliminated in our consolidated cost of revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue decreased to in  from i n  as the increased segment revenue absorbed relatively fixed costs 
w e expect our cost of revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of transactio n services segment revenue in this is attributable to the expected increase s in revenue and the change in customer mix as described above  which shoul d enable us to spread our fixed costs over a greater revenue base  and reduce d clearing expenses as a result of self clearing our trades through nyfi x clearing

our transaction services segment gross profit increased million t o million in from million in transaction services gros s profit margin increased to for  as compared to for th e increase in gross profit was attributable to the increase in transactio n revenue  which grew at a higher rate than costs 
as mentioned previously  nyfi x transaction services incurred costs for the entire year  but did not star t generating revenue until july  we expect our gross margin to continue t o improve as a percentage of transaction services segment revenue in this i s attributable to the expected increases revenue and change in customer mix a s described above  which should enable us to spread our fixed costs over a greate r revenue base  and reduced clearing expenses as a result of self clearing ou r trades through nyfix clearing

i n addition  our salaries and benefits increased million  primarily due t o increased staffing to support our operations  annual merit increases for ou r staff and continuing increases to health care costs

our broker dealer subsidiaries may nee d us to fund or commit more of our consolidated cash  cash equivalents an d short term investments in the future to maintain their individual minimum an d minimum excess net capital requirements 
if any or all of these broker deale r subsidiaries were to fall below their minimum or minimum excess net capita l requirements  their operations may be restricted by certain regulatory agencies we believe that we achieve greater synergies by integrating the produc t offerings of javelin and renaissance with our existing product offerings although our broker dealer businesses have incurred losses through thei r development and start up stages  we believe that revenue will continue t o increase as we gain greater acceptance of our product offerings 
although w e provided our unconsolidated affiliate  eurolink  with only million i n cumulative funding  it may need additional working capital funding until i t generates positive cash flow  and is exploring sources of funding  including us we believe that our cash and short term investments of million a t december   together with anticipated cash to be generated fro m operations  will be sufficient to support our capital and operating needs  ou r net capital requirements of our broker dealer operations and the operating need s of eurolink for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may obtain credi t facilities to provide incremental availability of working capital to furthe r support our operating and investment strategy 
the following summarizes our material commitments at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cas h flows in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt   capital lease obligations operating leases    purchase obligations    total    long term debt consists of payments on promissory notes issued i n connection with the renaissance acquisition

operating leases assumptions do not includ e the impact of executing a lease to acquire additional office space at one of ou r wall street offices 
as described in item properties  we expect this leas e will  within the next year  reduce our space by consolidating our offices o n wall street into one building and vacating our other offices 
regardless o f whether we are successful in sub leasing our space  the new lease will not hav e a significant effect on our liquidity in the next twelve months 
should we no t be able to sub lease our space  we plan to vacate  and the resulting additiona l lease payments will have an impact on our working capital 
purchase obligation s include minimum purchase obligations to certain telecommunication providers i n exchange for pricing discounts

a significant power or telecommunications failure could cause us and ou r customers to lose revenue and subject us to liability for customer losses 
our services depend on our ability to store  retrieve  process and manag e significant databases and to electronically receive and process trade orders our systems and data centers could fail due to power failures  caused by a variety of factors  or outages  caused by high demand placed on th e infrastructures of the utilities we use in new york city and elsewhere in th e northeast portion of the united states 
due to the complexity of thes e electrical systems  errors or failures could occur which render an entire sit e to be unusable 
we constantly monitor system loads and performances and as necessar y upgrade our systems to handle estimated increases in power consumption 
however we may not be able to accurately predict future demand 
to mitigate the impac t of power failures  we maintain critical data center facilities at two separat e locations in the northeast portion of the united states 
although these dat a centers are serviced by the same utility  they are serviced via differen t sub stations 
in the event of a power outage at any of our data centers  we us e uninterruptible power supplies ups to provide limited battery backup fo r critical systems 
we also use diesel powered generators to backup the upss 
in the event of loss of power or telecommunications services at either o f these locations  we believe there are sufficient backup facilities in place t o give us the necessary time to access  or switch over to  our redundant dat a center 
it is possible that multiple telecommunications vendors could b e impacted so severely that the multi vendor and multi site strategy would no t insure communications services to our customers 
since it is fairly common for multiple carriers to share the same physica l infrastructure such as central offices  telephone poles and below groun d conduit  instances like major cable cuts or regional natural disasters coul d adversely impact our customers and us 
we rely on multiple telecommunications carriers for data delivery 
an y disruptions to these services could have a material adverse effect on ou r business 
we utilize network services from five major carriers at t  qwest  sprint  mci and verizon 
customers are given the choice of using one or mor e network carriers to provide network services to their location 
a majority o f nyfix customers utilize a dual carrier solution 
our relationship with each of these carriers is that of a vendor providin g us services 
we currently do not provide any services to these carriers 
th e contracts with these carriers have commitment terms that range from two to fiv e years 
we receive discounts based on certain term and volume commitments currently  where applicable  we are exceeding any required monthly minimu m billing amounts 
our use of five major carriers has multiple benefits o diversity of telecommunication infrastructure between the majo r carriers nyfix  inc 
o a competitive environment to help insure aggressive pricing fo r network services o the ability to completely migrate circuits from one carrier t o another due to non competitive pricing or a carrier no longe r providing adequate services 
if a major carrier were to shut down its network without advance warning it would take at least days to replace the circuits of that vendor with thos e of another vendor 
if we moved from one carrier to another  we would incu r substantial expenses because of the need to use two carriers for some period o f time 
exclusivity agreements between carriers and connecting points on th e network could also impact us 
for example  mci is the sole provider of networ k services for nasdaq 
if mci discontinued operations  we would incur cost s transitioning to a new nasdaq network service provider 
the time needed to transfer circuits from one carrier to another would b e approximately four to six weeks 
during the transfer  we would incur overlappin g circuit charges with each carrier for a minimum of thirty days 
we would need t o have the new circuits in place before requesting that the original circuits b e disconnected  and we would have to provide days prior notice for the circuit s to be disconnected 
therefore  the minimum cost for us to move our business fro m one carrier to another would be at least one month of charges from the forme r carrier 
we are subject to human error in our operations  which could cause a disruptio n in our service to our customers and corrupt our data 
our services depend on our operations staff to manage significan t databases  systems  applications and processes that receive and process orders an outage of our systems and service could happen as a result of human error i n our operational procedures 
we believe we have experienced personnel whom w e regularly send for refresher training to hone their skills  we maintain databas e backups and roll back procedures in case a human error is made and we have othe r policies  processes and procedures in place that collectively help us to reduc e the possibility and consequences of human error 
however we can provide n o assurance that human error will not cause a significant disruption to ou r systems or service 
any infiltration of harmful viruses could cause us to lose revenues an d customers and subject us to liability for customer losses 
potential sources of a virus that could affect us include connections t o customer systems  emails received by us or connectivity to the internet although to date  we have not had any incidence of a virus fully penetrating ou r protective layers and infiltrating our production systems  we continue to revie w our protective layers and safeguards as our systems are susceptible to th e growing number of potential viruses 
we utilize multiple methods to combat viruses 
the first method is t o prevent viruses from entering our nyfix network 
this is done by placing rigi d restrictions on our nyfix network  called access controls lists acl 
acl s are used where customers or vendors connect to our nyfix network 
a secon d method of preventing viruses from entering our nyfix network is the use o f firewalls 
a firewall typically guards an internal network against maliciou s access from the outside  however  firewalls may also be configured to limi t access to the outside from internal users 
in spite of the acls and firewalls it may still be possible for viruses to enter our nyfix network 
if a virus is still able to penetrate our nyfix network  we utiliz e centrally managed anti virus scanning software on servers and workstations 
ou r anti virus software actively scans servers and workstations on the network 
i n spite of the active anti virus scanning  it is possible for a virus not to b e detected 
as an additional method to combat viruses  we utilize intrusion detectio n software ids 
ids servers and software are located at key points around th e network and monitor systems for malicious activity 
nyfix  inc 
we rely  in part  on others to supply the materials and supplies  underlyin g software and systems we use to provide our services 
if we are unable to obtai n third party support and delivery on a timely and reliable basis  our ability t o perform services could be hindered and the relationships we have with ou r customers could be harmed 
our manufactured products are based on standard pc components readil y available in the consumer market place 
all electronic  computer relate d components that we use in our products are not manufacturer or supplie r specific 
we can substitute components from a diverse group of manufacturer s with no assembly or delivery delays to our customers 
however  our manufactured products contain several custom parts specifi c to our design 
these parts are limited to sheet metal enclosures and interna l wiring 
we own the designs for these components and can source them fro m multiple vendors in our immediate area or throughout the united states currently we maintain relationships with a minimum of two alternate vendors fo r cabling and sheet metal  either of which can deliver components within standar d delivery cycles 
for both of these components we use vendors such as ctc advantage sheet metal and interface technology 
although we maintai n relationships with numerous vendors for our manufactured products  if we ar e unable to obtain third party delivery and support on a timely and reliabl e basis  our ability to provide our product and services could be hindered 
we rely on a number of third parties to supply software and systems  a s well as equipment and related maintenance 
our systems are built using a numbe r of commonly used technologies 
as an example  we use systems from ibm  hp emc  sun micro systems  oracle  sybase  veritas and microsoft 
our products ar e subject to potential defects in these third party components 
although we a s well as the individual vendors exercise strict testing and verification o f systems and software  defects can cause disruptions of customer service 
we hav e invested in various test systems to make sure supplier s components work as wel l as our developed software 
since we depend on third parties to supply us with underlying software an d systems on a reliable  timely basis  we maintain service and maintenanc e agreements with all our main vendors 
we have standard service agreements a t different levels  depending on how critical the vendor s system is to th e operation of our business 
for most systems we have a high level of redundancy which gives us less time critical dependency on a particular vendor 
we hav e warranty or maintenance agreements with all above mentioned vendors 
because o f the diversity in vendors  there is no dependence on a single vendor 
however  i f we are unable to obtain third party support and delivery on a timely an d reliable basis  our ability to perform services could be hindered and th e relationships we have with our customers could be harmed 
we depend on a limited number of network equipment suppliers and do not hav e supply contracts 
our inability to obtain necessary network equipment o r technical support could harm our business 
some key components we use in our networks are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
we do not have long term supply contracts wit h these or any other limited source vendors  and we purchase data networ k equipment on a purchase order basis 
if we are unable to obtain sufficien t quantities of limited source equipment and required technical support  or t o develop alternate sources as required in the future  our ability to deplo y equipment in our networks could be delayed or reduced  or we may be forced t o pay higher prices for our network components 
delays or reductions in supplie s could lead to slowdowns or failures of our networks 
our reliance on a limited number of telecommunication services providers expose s us to a number of risks over which we have no control  including risks wit h respect to increased prices and termination of essential services 
nyfix  inc 
the operation of our networks depends upon the capacity  reliability an d security of services provided to us by a limited number of telecommunicatio n services providers 
we have no control over the operation  quality o r maintenance of those services or whether the vendors will improve their service s or continue to provide services that are essential to our business 
in addition telecommunication services providers may increase the prices at which the y provide services  which would increase our costs 
if one or more of ou r telecommunication services providers were to cease to provide essential service s or to significantly increase their prices  we could be required to fin d alternative vendors for these services 
with a limited number of vendors  w e could experience significant delays in obtaining new or replacement services which could lead to slowdowns or failures of our networks 
this could harm ou r reputation and could cause us to lose customers and revenues 
a slowdown or failure of our networks could cause us to lose customers an d revenue 
our business is based upon our ability to rapidly and reliably receive an d transmit data through our networks 
one or more of our networks could slow dow n significantly or fail for a variety of reasons  including o undetected defects or errors in our software programs  especiall y when first integrated into a network  o unexpected problems encountered when integrating changes enhancements or upgrades of third party equipment or software wit h our systems  o computer viruses  o natural or man made disasters disrupting power or telecommunication s systems generally  and o damage to  or failure of  our systems due to human error o r intentional disruption 
we may not have sufficient redundant systems or backup telecommunication s facilities to allow us to receive and transmit data in the event of significan t system failures 
any significant degradation or failure of one or more of ou r networks could cause our customers to suffer delays in transaction processing which could damage our reputation  increase our service costs  or cause us t o lose customers and revenues 
our products may suffer from defects or errors  which may harm our reputation o r subject us to product liability claims 
the products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and qualit y control  current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products ma y contain errors 
any errors  slowdown or failure in our products may harm ou r reputation or subject us to product liability claims 
significant technica l challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase an d integrate them with a number of third party computer applications and software such integration may not always be successful 
any defects or errors that ar e discovered after commercial release could result in the loss of revenue or dela y in market acceptance of our products 
moreover  we could face higher developmen t costs if our products contain undetected errors  or if we fail to meet ou r customers expectations 
although we maintain general liability insuranc e coverage  this coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms o r at all 
in addition  a product liability claim  whether or not successful  coul d harm our business by increasing our costs and distracting our management 
we face substantial competition in our individual product areas from companie s that have larger and greater financial  technical and marketing capabilities this could make it more difficult for us to gain or maintain market share an d may hinder our ability to compete successfully 
nyfix  inc 
we operate in a highly competitive market and expect competition t o intensify in the future 
certain of our competitors  including the financia l exchanges  may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketin g resources and more extensive customer bases and knowledge of the industry 
our industry is constantly evolving through technological and regulator y change 
our competition varies widely and we encounter different categories o f competitors for each of our product and service offerings 
we also fac e competition from customers who choose to maintain their own infrastructure an d develop their own in house proprietary order management software systems 
if we do not compete effectively  we may lose market share to competitors an d suffer a decline in revenues 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing an d other resources than us 
as a result  they may be able to support lower pricin g and margins and to devote greater resources to marketing their current and ne w products and services 
we may not be able to adapt to changing technology and our customers technolog y needs 
we face rapidly changing technology and frequent new service offerings b y competitors that can render existing services obsolete or unmarketable 
ou r future success depends on our ability to enhance existing services and t o develop  introduce and market  on a timely and cost effective basis  ne w services that keep pace with technological developments and custome r requirements 
our customers may develop in house networks or use network providers other tha n nyfix and divert part or all of their data communications from our networks t o their networks 
our customers may develop in house networks or use other network provider s because such customers want to connect to destinations not part of our nyfi x network or to only certain  but not all  destinations covered by our nyfi x network 
as a result of any of these events  we could experience lower revenue s or lost revenues from delays in connecting customers to our nyfix networ k indirectly through third party providers rather than directly by us 
we face significant pressure on the prices for our services from our competitor s and customers 
our failure to sustain pricing could impair our ability t o achieve or maintain profitability or positive cash flow 
our competitors and customers may cause us to reduce the prices we charg e for services  the effects of which we may not be able to offset by increasin g the number of customers or transactions 
the primary sources of pricing pressur e include o competitors offering our customers services at reduced prices 
o our customers seeking greater pricing discounts 
o consolidation of existing customers 
a decline in subscription revenue  our largest source of revenue  or transactio n revenue would adversely affect our profitability 
subscription revenue is our most significant source of revenue subscription revenue is fixed based on a contractual period of time  typicall y one to three years  and is not affected by trading volumes 
however  tradin g volumes do affect the revenues of our customers and this could affect thei r future purchases of our technology and services 
pricing pressures due t o competition  failure to sign new agreements with customers because of reduction s in their new technology spending  and observed consolidation in the financia l sector could affect our revenues and profitability 
our costs associated wit h supporting the subscription agreements are generally fixed and thus a loss o f revenue would impact profitability 
nyfix  inc 
transaction revenue has been a growing component of our revenue  however there is no assurance we can continue to grow transaction revenue 
as our cost s to support transaction revenue are generally fixed  a decline in revenue woul d directly impact our profitability 
several risk factors apply to the analysis o f the potential growth of transaction revenue 
there is significant competitive pressure brought on by a proliferation o f electronic execution competitors 
there is the potential for change in th e current united states market structure that may make it difficult for th e transaction business to compete with more traditional broker dealer busines s models 
for example  the nyse could establish limits on electronic access  o r the nyse could create an electronic matching order engine of its own 
customer demands for increased bandwidth and speed could place significan t stress on our infrastructure requiring continued reinvestment in hardware an d software to keep pace with overall business growth 
we have no current plans t o transition from the subscription or transaction based revenue model due t o general acceptance of it in the marketplace and the current trend of recurring predictable revenue recognition and cash flows 
nyse and sec specific regulatory changes may impair our revenue 
we provide our floor broker technology services to major nyse member firm s and a large group of brokers 
the nyse is proposing to update the securitie s trading rules related to the dot system services of nyse direct and nys e institutional express 
both of these services are electronic trade executio n services that nyse has created to compete  mainly with ecns and other full y electronic marketplaces 
if the extended functionality and access to either one or both nyse direc t and nyse institutional express are successful  this may lead to a lesser nee d to utilize floor brokers and clerks to execute trades on the nyse 
thi s situation would proportionally reduce the need for floor booth technology 
thi s situation is a risk to the nyfix subscription revenue that is generated fro m existing operations 
this situation also is a risk to estimating future growt h in the subscription revenue from floor booth technology provided by nyfix 
we would be most impacted if the nyse proposed changes happen in a ver y sudden timeframe and create an immediate consolidation of large nyse membe r firms and independent member firms 
we are aware that both types of firms hav e been operating under sustained financial pressure due to market condition s during to present 
we anticipate that many member firms both large an d small could become insolvent within months if the given changes do make the nys e more electronically accessible and reduce order flow to the floor brokerag e groups 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights  which coul d weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenues and increase our costs 
our success and ability to compete are dependent to a significant degre e on our intellectual property rights  which include our proprietary technology trade secrets and customer base 
however  no one patent  trademark or other for m of intellectual property rights is critical to our business 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorize d parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products o r technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and w e cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use o f our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protec t our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are abl e to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual propert y rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of th e proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement o r invalidity 
litigation  whether or not successful  could result in substantia l costs and diversions of resources 
nyfix  inc 
we may face claims of infringement of proprietary rights  which could harm ou r business and operating results 
third parties may assert claims that we are infringing their proprietar y rights 
if infringement claims are asserted against us  we could incu r significant costs in defending those claims 
we may be required to discontinu e using and selling any infringing technology and services  to expend resources t o develop non infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties fo r other technology 
we may be unable to acquire licenses for the other technolog y on reasonable commercial terms or at all 
as a result  we may find that we ar e unable to continue to offer the services and products upon which our busines s depends 
the securities brokerage industry is subject to extensive government regulation if nyfix millennium  nyfix transaction services or nyfix clearing fail to compl y with these regulations  they may be subject to disciplinary or other action b y regulatory organizations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and may be subject t o disciplinary or other action by regulatory organizations if we fail to compl y with such regulation  which could increase our capital expenditures and decreas e our earnings 
nyfix millennium  nyfix transaction services and nyfix clearing ar e subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
in additio n to these laws  we must comply with rules of the sec  including regulation at s for nyfix millennium  and the nasd  various stock exchanges  state securitie s commissions and other regulatory bodies charged with safeguarding the integrit y of the securities markets and other financial markets and protecting th e interests of investors participating in these markets 
as registere d broker dealers  nyfix millennium  nyfix transaction services and nyfix clearin g are subject to numerous regulations covering the securities business  including o marketing practices  o capital structure  including net capital requirements  o record keeping  and o conduct of directors  officers and employees 
any failure to comply with these regulations could subject nyfi x millennium  nyfix transaction services or nyfix clearing to censure  fines  th e issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension  and or disqualificatio n of its officers  directors or employees 
the fines  if material  could have a n adverse effect on our earnings because it could greatly increase our capita l expenditures 
if any of our employees were suspended or disqualified  we may b e unable to meet the needs of our customers or to solicit new business 
this coul d also have an adverse effect on our earnings 
furthermore  any such penaltie s could materially harm our reputation in the industry  which could have a long term effect on our financial growth 
nyfix millennium s  nyfix transaction services or nyfix clearing s complianc e and risk management methods may not be effective 
nyfix millennium s  nyfix transaction services and nyfix clearing s ability to comply with regulations depends largely on the establishment an d maintenance of an effective compliance system  as well as their ability t o attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 
nyfix millennium  nyfi x transaction services or nyfix clearing could be subject to disciplinary or othe r actions due to claimed noncompliance with regulations in the future 
if a claim nyfix  inc 
of noncompliance is made by a regulatory authority  the efforts of th e management of nyfix millennium  nyfix transaction services or nyfix clearin g could be diverted to responding to such claim and they could be subject to a range of possible consequences  including the payment of fines  civil lawsuit s and the suspension of one or more portions of its business 
in addition  thei r mode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by o additional legislation  o changes in rules promulgated by the sec  the nasd  the board o f governors of the federal reserve system  the various stock exchange s or other self regulatory organizations  or o changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws an d rules 
in addition  nyfix millennium s status as a recognized ats requires tha t its trade execution and communication systems be able to handle anticipate d present and future peak trading volumes 
if any of our systems become disabled the ability to process trades and handle peak trading volumes will b e compromised 
the status of nyfix millennium and nyfix clearing corporation as a n sec registered broker dealers and nasd members is conditioned  in part  on thei r ability to process and settle trades 
our broker dealers subsidiaries may be restricted in their operations shoul d they fail to meet their minimum and minimum excess net capital requirements 
our nyfix millennium  nyfix transaction services and nyfix clearin g broker dealer subsidiaries  individually  have to maintain certain minimum ne t capital and minimum excess net capital requirements as mandated by certai n regulatory agencies 
some of these requirements vary according to th e profitability of the broker dealer and rise as profitability falls 
at decembe r   our broker dealers in the aggregate had minimum net capital an d minimum excess net capital requirements of million 
our broker deale r operations may need additional funds in the future to maintain their minimum an d minimum excess net capital requirements 
at december   we had cash an d short term investments of million that were not subject to ou r broker dealer minimum net capital and minimum excess net capital requirements if our broker dealers fall below their minimum and minimum excess net capita l requirements  their operations would be restricted by their respectiv e regulatory agencies 
our broker dealer subsidiaries are at risk if their customers default on thei r trading obligations 
under applicable regulatory requirements  our broker dealers are require d to cover for their customers if their customers default on their tradin g obligations by improperly failing to deliver cash or securities on the date whe n a trade settles 
the broker dealer can pursue its customer for losses th e broker dealer sustains by delivering the required cash or securities 
ou r broker dealers attempt to manage the risks associated with customer tradin g defaults by conducting a number of background checks on their customers including financial history  credit  regulatory and legal checks 
th e broker dealer decides which background checks to undertake based on th e relationship with the customer and the nature and extent of the business tha t the customer has with the broker dealer 
in addition  our broker dealers monito r trades to check that counterparties know and confirm trades before settlemen t date to minimize market risk to which our broker dealers can be exposed betwee n trade date and settlement date 
despite these measures to reduce the risk to ou r broker dealers from trading defaults by their customers  there can be n o assurance that our broker dealers will avoid such risks entirely or that i f losses do occur they will not have a material impact on the financial conditio n or reputation of the affected broker dealer 
nyfix clearing may not be able to clear trades due to maximum limits imposed b y the dtcc and the need for intra day funding commitments from third parties 
nyfix clearing is restricted to a maximum limit imposed by the dtcc 
i n addition  to be able to clear trades  nyfix clearing may require adde d commitments from unaffiliated institutions to provide funding during a tradin g day intra day funding 
an inability to maintain or raise its maximum limi t or to obtain and maintain third party commitments to support intra day fundin g could have an adverse impact on nyfix clearing s ability to maintain or expan d its business 
nyfix  inc 
the ability of nyfix clearing to maintain or expand its business could b e adversely impacted if it did not continue to have third party assistance t o access exchanges and other important trading venues 
nyfix clearing provides clearing and settlement services with th e assistance of third parties who provide nyfix clearing access to exchanges an d other important trading venues in the execution business 
if such third parties exchanges or regulators determine that nyfix clearing must discontinue suc h indirect access  this could have an adverse impact on nyfix clearing s abilit y to maintain or expand its business 
we may lack the capital required to maintain our competitive position or t o sustain our growth 
we have historically relied on cash flow from operations and proceeds fro m equity and debt to fund our operations  capital expenditures and expansion 
i f we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future  we may face th e following risks o we may not be able to continue to meet customer demand for servic e quality  availability and competitive pricing 
o we may not be able to expand or to acquire complementary businesses o we may not be able to develop new services or otherwise respond t o changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures we may not have adequate resources to meet demands resulting from growth 
growth may strain our management systems and resources 
we may need t o make additional investments in the following areas o recruitment and training  o communications and information systems  o sales and marketing  o facilities and other infrastructure  o treasury and accounting functions  o licensing and acquisition of technology and rights  and o employee and customer relations and management 
if we fail to develop systems  procedures and controls to handle curren t and future growth on a timely basis  we may be less efficient in the managemen t of our business or encounter difficulties implementing our strategy  either o f which could harm our results of operations 
conducting business in international markets subjects us to additional risks also  our strategy to expand our business internationally may fail  which ma y impede our growth and harm our operating results 
for the years ended december   and  approximately and  respectively  of our revenue was derived from our international nyfix  inc 
operations 
we believe international revenue will be an important component fo r our future success 
thus  we are subject to various risks in doing business i n international markets  including o difficulties in recruiting  training and retaining personnel an d managing and implementing existing and new international operations o localizing our products to target the specific needs and preference s of foreign customers  which may differ from our traditional custome r base in the united states  o building our brand name and awareness of our services among foreig n customers  o competition with existing market participants which have a longe r history in and greater familiarity with the foreign markets w e enter  o laws and business practices that can favor local competitors  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates  o imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies int o united states dollars or remittance of dividends and other payment s by foreign subsidiaries  and o changes in a specific country s or region s political or economi c conditions 
if we fail adequately to address the challenges and risks associated wit h our international operations and expansion  we may encounter difficultie s implementing our strategy  which could impede our growth or harm our operatin g results 
our ability to sell our products and services and grow our business could b e significantly impaired if we lose the services of key personnel 
our business is highly dependent on a number of key executive officers including peter k 
hansen  our founder  chief executive officer and president and lars kragh  our chief information officer  who have been with us since ou r inception in the loss of the services of any of our key personnel coul d have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws are likely to increas e our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules subsequentl y implemented by the securities and exchange commission  has required changes i n some of our corporate governance and accounting practices 
in addition  th e nasdaq has promulgated a number of regulations 
we expect these laws  rules an d regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to mak e some activities more difficult  time consuming and costly 
we also expect thes e new rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us t o obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required t o accept reduced coverage or incur significantly higher costs to obtain coverage these new laws  rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for u s to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularl y to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
terrorist threats and attacks and the iraqi situation have created significan t instability and uncertainty in the financial marketplace to which we sell an d may create a more volatile environment 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   th e declaration of war by the united states against terrorism and the curren t situation in iraq have created significant instability and uncertainty in th e financial marketplace  both in the united states and globally

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may be expected t o result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a resul t of fluctuations in credit ratings of the issuer  equity prices  interest rate s or foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financia l instruments for any purpose 
we are exposed to market risk principally through changes in interes t rates and equity prices 
our short term investment portfolio of million an d million at december  and  respectively  consisted of million and million  respectively  of auction rate certificates and million of mutual fund securities at december  we also had millio n of treasury bills at december  risk is limited on the auction rat e certificates portfolio due to the fact that it is invested in insured municipa l bonds 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for the auction rate certificates would not be materia l to operations  cash flows or fair value 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our million of treasury bill s at december  a hypothetical change in interest rates would no t result in a material change in their fair value 
the mutual fund securities portfolio was invested in a quoted fund tha t was managed by an institution which primarily invests in investment grad e securities  with up to a maximum of invested in high yield securities rate d b or higher 
these securities were subject to equity price risk 
we are also subject to interest rate risk on our million and million of notes receivable from unconsolidated affiliates at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would no t result in a material change in their fair value 
foreign currency risk our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the unite d states dollar as compared with foreign currencies  predominately the britis h pound and the euro  due to our operations in the united kingdom and europe 
we manage foreign currency risk through the structure of our business 
i n the substantial majority of our transactions  we receive payments denominated i n the united states dollar or british pounds sterling 
therefore  we do not rel y on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies 
th e foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that th e majority of transactions are paid according to our standard payment terms  whic h are generally short term in nature 
for the year ended december   w e recorded a foreign exchange translation gain of million
