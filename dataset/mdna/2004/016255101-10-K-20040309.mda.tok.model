given these risks and uncertainties  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview since our inception in april  we have been engaged in the design  manufacture and marketing of invisalign  a proprietary system for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
the invisalign product has two components clincheck and aligners 
clincheck is an internet based application that allows dental professionals to simulate treatment  in three dimensions  by modeling two week stages of tooth movement 
aligners are thin  clear plastic  removable dental appliances that are manufactured in a series to correspond to each two week stage of the clincheck simulation 
aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed for an individual patient by dental professionals using clincheck 
two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans  which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of clincheck and are used in conjunction with stereolithography technology to manufacture aligner molds 
a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners from the molds and ships the completed products to our customers 
revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment  provided that no significant obligations remain  transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
the costs of producing the clincheck treatment plan  which are incurred prior to the production of aligners  are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned  ie upon shipment of the aligners 
in cases where the dental professional elects to finish the treatment plan using invisalign  the dental professional orders case refinement 
from june through april  we offered our dental professionals the opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount 
the advance purchase price was non refundable 
revenue  in the amount of the stand alone sales price of the undelivered element  is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration 
in cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinements in advance  case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 
in may  we updated our domestic pricing policy to include the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of each  which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings 
revenue deferrals associated with future case refinement sales 
table of contents are per case 
this revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with the newly adopted rules contained in eitf  which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services 
these revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case expiration  which ever is earliest 
service revenues earned for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed 
service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates  which are intended to approximate a mark up on our anticipated costs 
we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales  if any  in the period such sales occur 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 
we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have achieved profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to expend significant capital to continue to build consumer demand  expand our dental professional channel  automate our manufacturing processes and develop both product and process technology 
in november  we completed a private placement of common stock to a group of investors led by existing shareholders  raising million  net of issuance costs 
in december  we secured an accounts receivable based revolving line of credit of up to million  and in december negotiated more favorable terms and increased the line of credit up to million 
in december  we also secured an equipment based term loan of million  which was fully drawn down in december as of december   we had not utilized the accounts receivable based revolving line of credit 
as of december   the equipment based term loan had an outstanding balance of million 
accessing the accounts receivable based revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with certain loan covenants 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be adequate for us to avoid reducing operating expenses by  among other things  reducing planned capital expenditures relating to enhancing our manufacturing process and reducing worldwide staff 
litigation settlement included in general and administrative expenses 
on april   we exercised our right to terminate an exclusive marketing agreement dated october  with discus dental impressions  inc pursuant to the express terms of the agreement and issued a press release reporting this termination 
on or about may   we received a demand for arbitration submitted by discus dental with the american arbitration association in san jose  california 
on february   the panel issued its final arbitration award which concluded the arbitration proceedings initiated by discus dental 
under the final arbitration award  discus dental is entitled to a judgment in the amount of in damages and attorney fees and costs in the amount of million 
in reaching their decision  the arbitrators found that align s termination of its marketing agreement with discus dental in april of was wrongful 
we included the million charge relating to the final arbitration award in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  in july  we announced a plan to streamline worldwide operations 
the plan included closing our facilities in pakistan and the uae we transitioned the operations performed at these facilities to the united states and costa rica 
for the period ending december   we recorded severance charges of million  facility closure charges of million  a loss on disposal of fixed assets of million and an impairment charge of million related to the land in pakistan 
the land was written down to a zero value to reflect its fair value as estimated by our management 
approximately million of accrued charges related to professional fees were included in accrued liabilities as of december  we discontinued operations at our facilities in pakistan and the uae in october and december  respectively 
we concluded the remainder of indirect operational activities related to the costa rica transition in january we will cease non operational closing activities in pakistan when the land is disposed of and in the uae when the necessary statutory filings have been completed

deferred stock based compensation for options granted to employees is the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date such options were granted and their exercise price 
for stock options granted to non employees  the fair value of the options  estimated using the black scholes valuation model  is initially recorded on the date of grant 
as the non employee options vest  we revalue the remaining unvested options  with the change in fair value from period to period represented as a change in deferred compensation

interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest income decreased in fiscal by million primarily due to the decrease in our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities 
table of contents balances 
interest income for the year ended december  was primarily generated from our cash and cash equivalents balance and investments in short term marketable securities 
other expenses increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  offsetting the overall decreases in interest and other income expense was a charge of million in the first quarter of for non cash interest expense  related to the beneficial conversion feature embedded in convertible subordinated notes 
dividend related to beneficial conversion feature of preferred stock 
in we issued  shares of series d preferred stock which were subject to an antidilution conversion price adjustment feature 
we triggered this antidilution conversion price adjustment feature when we granted options to purchase our common stock beyond the number of options that were authorized under our plan at the time we commenced our series d preferred stock offering in may the conversion feature provided that if  during the period between may  the commitment date for our series d preferred stock offering and the earlier of the closing of an initial public offering or january   we had granted more than an aggregate of  options to purchase our common stock  then the conversion price of our series d preferred stock would be adjusted downward from its original conversion price of per share 
as of the end of january  we had granted an aggregate of  options to purchase shares of our common stock in excess of the  options permitted 
as a result we were required to issue an additional  shares of common stock upon the conversion of the series d preferred stock 
these shares were in addition to the  additional shares of common stock that we were required to issue upon conversion of the series d preferred stock as of december  as a result  we recorded a deemed dividend for the year ended december  based on the fair value of the common stock

the charge for the years ended december  and were recorded as million and million  respectively 
the charge is equal to the intrinsic value difference between the exercise price of the accelerated options and the fair value of the common stock on the date of acceleration 
income taxes we have incurred immaterial amounts of income tax expense to date since we have not been profitable on an annual basis in either our domestic or international operations 
as of december   we have aggregate federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million 
as of december  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our existing net deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we have aggregate federal and state research tax credit carryforwards of million as of december  
table of contents the federal research credit carryforwards expire beginning in the year  if not utilized 
the state research credit carryforward does not expire 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in the year for federal and for state purposes  if not utilized 
utilization of the federal net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be limited by the change of ownership provisions contained in section of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our operations with the proceeds from the sale of our common and preferred stock  an equipment based term loan and bridge loans 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of restricted cash and million of short term marketable securities 
we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from cash collections from customers  increases in accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from operating losses and increases in accounts receivable balances in fiscal over fiscal net cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  and net cash provided by investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities resulted primarily from the purchase of property and equipment for capacity expansion in costa rica

net cash provided by financing activities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for both the years ended december  and  net cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  partially offset by payments on debt obligations 
in november  we completed a private placement of  shares common stock to a group of investors led by existing shareholders  raising million  net of issuance costs 
in december  we accessed a million equipment based term loan  and the balance of the loan as of december  was million 
contractual obligations the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows total payments due by period less than year years years more than years in thousands equipment based term loan  including current portion capital lease obligation  including current portion operating lease obligations computer support services manufacturing services total amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments 

table of contents we expect that our operating expenses will increase commensurate with an overall increase in the level of our business activity  including increased sales and the related costs of products sold  our consumer advertising campaign and dental professional marketing efforts  continuing efforts to automate our manufacturing processes  increases in the size of our sales force and dental professional training staff  continued international sales and marketing efforts  and development and improvements to our product 
in addition  we may use cash to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
our capital requirements depend on market acceptance of our products and our ability to market  sell and support our products on a worldwide basis 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we could be required to delay establishing a national brand  building manufacturing infrastructure and developing our product and process technology  or to reduce our expenditures in general 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  legal contingencies and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and eitf sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered are based on management s judgments based on whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
eitf addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
revenue from the sale of invisalign and ancillary products is recognized upon product shipment  provided that no significant obligations remain  transfer of title has occurred and collection of the receivable is deemed probable 
the costs of producing the clincheck treatment plan  which are incurred prior to the production of aligners  are deferred and recognized as related revenues are earned  ie upon shipment of the aligners 
in cases where the dental professional elects to finish the treatment plan using invisalign  the dental professional orders case refinement 
from june through april  we offered our dental professionals the opportunity to purchase case refinement in advance at a discount 
the advance purchase price was non 
table of contents refundable 
revenue  in the amount of the stand alone sales price of the undelivered element  is deferred until the earlier of shipment of the case refinement or case expiration 
in cases where the dental professional did not purchase case refinement in advance  case refinement revenues are recognized when the new aligners are shipped 
in may  we updated our domestic pricing policy to include the future delivery of one case refinement in the price of each case and to offer additional case refinements at a price of each  which we believe represents its fair value based on competitive product offerings 
revenue deferrals associated with future case refinement after may  are per case 
this revenue deferral amount represents the fair value of a case refinement as determined in accordance with eitf  which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services 
these revenue deferrals will be recognized when the case refinement has been utilized or upon case expiration  which ever is earliest 
service revenues earned for training of dental professionals and staff for invisalign are recorded as the services are performed 
service revenues earned under agreements with third parties are based on negotiated rates  which are intended to approximate a mark up on our anticipated costs 
we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales  if any  in the period such sales occur 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 
warranty expense the company generally warrants its products for a specific period of time against material defects 
the company provides for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in costs of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represents the best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that the company expects to incur to repair or replace product which fails while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience as to product failures as well as current information on repair costs 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews the accrued balances and updates the historical warranty cost trends 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty  which covers defects in materials and workmanship 
our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed 
in the event the aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty  we will replace the aligners at our expense 
our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended 
if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners  and as a result  requests additional invisalign treatment  the dental professional pays for the additional expense 
the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
our warranty policy is effective for shipped products which are considered defective or fail to meet the product specifications 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs is primarily based on our historical experience with product failures as well as current information on replacement costs 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimate amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
we periodically review these estimated allowances  including an analysis of the customers payment history and information regarding the customers creditworthiness 
if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  an additional allowance may be required and would negatively impact our operating results 

table of contents accounting for long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in the stock price for a sustained period and the market capitalization relative to net book value 
if these factors or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact operating results 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
because of uncertainties related to both the potential amount and range of loss from pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome in these legal proceedings 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly 
revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred tax valuation allowance we have established a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
while we have considered potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the full valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and for hedging relationships designated after june  the adoption of fas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents risk factors the statements contained below and elsewhere in this report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including  without limitation  statements regarding our expectations  hopes  beliefs  anticipations  commitments  intentions and strategies regarding the future 
actual results could differ from those projected in any forward looking statements for the reasons  among others  detailed below 
the fact that some of the risk factors may be the same or similar to our past filings means only that the risks are present in multiple periods 
we believe that many of the risks detailed here are part of doing business in the industry in which we compete and will likely be present in all periods reported 
the fact that certain risks are characteristic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk 
the forward looking statements are made as of the date of this annual report on form k  and we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the operating losses and negative cash flows we have experienced in the past may continue throughout fiscal and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by a company in an early stage of operations 
since inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and we have only achieved profitability during the fourth quarter of fiscal from inception through july  we spent significant funds on organizational and start up activities  recruiting key managers and employees  developing invisalign and developing our manufacturing and customer support resources 
we also spent significant funds on clinical trials and training programs to train dental professionals in the use of invisalign 
we continue to incur significant operating expenses to develop new software and increase the automation of our manufacturing processes  execute our consumer advertising campaign and dental professional marketing efforts  increase the size of our sales force and clinical education support staff  execute clinical research and education plans  develop technological improvements to our products  continue our international sales and marketing efforts  and undertake quality assurance and improvement initiatives 
as a result  we will need to increase our revenue significantly  while controlling our expenses  to achieve profitability 
only recently  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  have we generated positive cash flow from operations  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase such positive cash flow from operations  from period to period  in the future 
it is possible that we will not achieve profitability in the future  and even if we do achieve profitability in future periods  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability in future periods 
we have a limited operating history and expect our future financial results to fluctuate which may cause volatility in our stock price 
we were incorporated in april and began sales of invisalign in july thus  we have a limited operating history  which makes an evaluation of our future prospects and your investment in our stock difficult 
in addition  we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we increase our commercial sales 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include changes in the timing of product orders  
table of contents unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity  any disruptions in the manufacturing process or the introduction of new production processes  inaccurate forecasting of revenue  production and other operating costs  and the development and marketing of directly competitive products by potential competitors 
to respond to these and other factors  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if our revenue for a particular period falls below our expectations  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenue growth or any decrease in revenue levels 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
we have limited product offerings  and if demand for invisalign declines or fails to develop as we expect  our revenue will decline 
we expect that revenue from the sale of invisalign will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue 
continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign is critical to our future success 
invisalign may not achieve market acceptance at the rate at which we expect  or at all  which could reduce our revenue and results of operations 
if dental professionals do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate  our operating results will be harmed 
our success depends upon increasing acceptance of invisalign by dental professionals 
invisalign requires dental professionals and their staff to undergo special training and learn to interact with patients in new ways 
in addition  because invisalign has only been in clinical testing since july and commercially available only since july  dental professionals may be reluctant to adopt it until more historical clinical results are available 
also  increasing adoption and cumulative use by dental professionals will depend on factors such as the capability  safety  efficacy  ease of use  price  quality and reliability of our products and our provision of effective sales support  training and service 
in the future  unanticipated poor clinical performance of invisalign could result in significant adverse publicity and  consequently  reduced acceptance by dental professionals 
if invisalign does not achieve growing acceptance in the orthodontic and dental communities  our operating results will be harmed 
if consumers do not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate  our operating results will be harmed 
invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment  and patients may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to conventional treatment 
in addition  patients may not comply with recommended treatment guidelines for invisalign  which could compromise the effectiveness of their treatment 
we have generally received positive feedback from both dental professionals and patients regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion  but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients 
our success will depend upon the acceptance of invisalign by a substantially larger number of dental professionals and potential patients to whom we are now actively marketing 
we have had a limited number of complaints from patients and prospective patients generally related to shipping delays and minor manufacturing irregularities 
market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals  as well 
table of contents as other factors including effectiveness  safety  reliability  improved treatment aesthetics and greater comfort and hygiene compared to conventional orthodontic products 
furthermore  consumers may not respond to our direct marketing campaigns or we may be unsuccessful in reaching our target audience 
adoption by consumers may also be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions  including the economic downturn and increased unemployment levels in the united states of america  levels of consumer confidence and consumer spending  all of which fluctuate and could be affected by unstable global economic  political or other conditions 
if orthodontists and dentists experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services or consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate  our operating results will be harmed 
we are dependent on our international manufacturing operations  which exposes us to foreign operational  political and other risks that may harm our business 
currently  two of our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare electronic treatment plans  which are transmitted electronically back to the us these electronic files form the basis of our clincheck product and are used to manufacture aligner molds 
a third party manufacturer in mexico fabricates aligners and ships the completed products to our customers 
our costs associated with these operations are denominated in costa rican colons  mexican pesos and us dollars 
our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation  including political  social and economic instability  acts of terrorism and acts of war  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  controlling quality of the manufacturing process  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption  burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  import and export license requirements and restrictions  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and potential adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize in the future  our operating results may be harmed 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be harmed 
our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products  both in the us and in other countries 
our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 
we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and numerous foreign issued patents  as well as pending foreign patent applications 
we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
however  our currently 
table of contents pending or future patent filings may not issue as patents 
additionally  any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable  circumvented  or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products 
in addition  any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws 
we also rely on protection of our copyrights  trade secrets  know how and proprietary information 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information  and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents  copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
in particular  a failure of our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology  which could adversely affect pricing and market share 
if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim  our ability to grow our business will be severely limited 
extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry 
we have been sued for infringement of another party s patent in the past and  while that action has been dismissed  we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
on january   ormco corporation filed suit against us in the united states district court for the central district  orange county division  asserting infringement of us patent nos 
  and  the complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
on february   we answered the complaint and asserted counterclaims seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and non infringement of the asserted patents 
in addition  we counterclaimed for infringement of our us patent no 
 seeking unspecified monetary damages and injunctive relief 
ormco filed a reply to our counterclaims on march  and asserted counterclaims against us seeking a declaration by the court of invalidity and non infringement of us patent no 
 we responded to ormco s counterclaims on april  we amended our counterclaim to add allesee orthodontic appliances  inc aoa  a wholly owned subsidiary of ormco  as a counterdefendant in regard to our counterclaim of infringement of us patent no 
 the court then permitted ormco to amend its complaint and permitted us to amend our counterclaim to add an additional patent each 
ormco filed a first amended complaint for infringement of us patent no 
 on october  on october   we filed an answer to ormco s first amended complaint and a counterclaim for invalidity and non infringement of us patent no 
 and for infringement of us patent no 
 at a scheduling conference held on november   the court set a june  discovery cutoff and an october trial date 
three years ago  ormco filed suit against us asserting infringement of us patent nos 
 and  in june  the parties entered into a stipulation of dismissal with ormco 
ormco agreed for a period of at least two years not to pursue litigation with respect to these patents  except as set forth below 
further  ormco agreed that it would not bring any patent action against us for at least a period of one year with respect to any as yet unissued patents 
if ormco were to bring such an action concerning as yet unissued patents after one year  the stipulation of dismissal would allow ormco to include in such an action claims involving us patent nos 
 and  in august  ormco notified us of the issuance of us patent no 
 and offered a license for this patent 
we did not take a license to this patent 
five months after ormco s notification  it filed the lawsuit that is currently pending 
the claims in us patent nos 
 and  relate to methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances 
the relevant claims are limited to computerized methods and 
table of contents algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient 
the claims in us patent nos 
 and  are more generic claims relating to the methods and systems for forming and manufacturing custom orthodontic appliances 
based on the disclosure in the patent  however  the relevant claims also appear to be limited to computerized methods and algorithms for determining the final positioning of a patient s teeth based upon a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient 
the treatment plan simulation developed in our facilities determines the final positioning of a patient s teeth but is not based on a derived or ideal dental archform of the patient 
the claims in our us patent nos 
 and  relate to methods and systems for incrementally moving teeth using a series of appliances designed to be placed successively on the patient s teeth 
we strongly believe that ormco s claims of infringement lack merit and that our counterclaim of infringement will be successful 
however  the outcome of a lawsuit is inherently unpredictable 
should our technology be found to infringe any one of ormco s asserted patents  we would have to seek a license from ormco  which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in that event  we could be subject to damages or an injunction  which could materially adversely affect our business 
from time to time  we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights 
while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention  there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in a patent suit by ormco or in any other litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  in which event  our business would be materially adversely affected 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation and financial condition 
we are currently a party to various legal proceedings and claims 
management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
however  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or  in cases where injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any specific period  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of that period or future periods 
we currently rely on third parties to provide key inputs to our manufacturing process  and if our access to these inputs is diminished  our business may be harmed 
we currently outsource key portions of our manufacturing process 
we rely on a third party manufacturer in mexico to fabricate aligners and to ship the completed product to customers 
as a result  if this third party manufacturer fails to deliver its components or if we lose its services  we may be unable to deliver our products in a timely manner and our business may be harmed 
this third party manufacturer was recently acquired by a larger company in its industry 
any difficulties encountered by the acquiring company with respect to assimilating personnel and operations  and maintaining acceptable manufacturing standards  controls  procedures and policies could disrupt our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner 
finding a substitute manufacturer may be expensive  time consuming or impossible 

table of contents in addition  we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment  rapid prototyping machines  resin and other advanced materials 
we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies 
our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth 
in the event of delivery delays or shortages of these items  our business and growth prospects may be harmed 
we have experienced rapid growth  and our failure to manage this growth could harm our business 
we have expanded rapidly since we commenced commercial sales in our headcount increased from approximately employees as of september  to approximately employees as of december  this expansion will continue to place significant demands on our management and other resources and will require us to continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls  both in the us and internationally 
in particular  rapid growth increases the challenges involved in a number of areas  including recruiting and retaining sufficient skilled personnel  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain our high quality standards  and preserving our culture and values 
our inability to effectively manage this level of growth could harm our business 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 
we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering  technology development and management teams 
the loss of the services of those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit  train and retain additional qualified personnel 
in addition  few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices  universities and other research institutions 
thus  we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business 
furthermore  we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition in the future 
currently  our invisalign product competes directly against a product called red  white and blue  which is manufactured and distributed by ormco  a subsidiary of sybron dental specialties 
in addition  manufacturers of traditional braces  such as m company  sybron dental specialties and dentsply international have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may  in the future  attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours 
large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market 
furthermore  we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies 
we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by our competitors  our business could be harmed 
we may be unable to raise additional capital if it should be necessary  which could harm our ability to compete 
we have incurred significant operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception and have achieved profitability for the first time in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 

table of contents we expect to expend significant capital to continue to build our national brand  expand our dental professional channels  automate our manufacturing processes and develop both product and process technology 
in november  we completed a private placement of common stock to a group of investors led by existing stockholders  raising million  net of issuance costs 
in december  we secured an accounts receivable based revolving line of credit of up to million  and in december negotiated more favorable terms and increased the line of credit up to million 
in december  we also secured an equipment based term loan of million  which was fully drawn down in december as of december   we had not utilized the accounts receivable based revolving line of credit 
accessing the accounts receivable based revolving line of credit is restricted based on qualifying accounts receivable and compliance with customary loan covenants 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be adequate for us to avoid reducing operating expenses by  among other things  reducing planned capital expenditures relating to enhancing our manufacturing process and reducing worldwide staff 
complying with the food and drug administration fda and other regulations is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally 
fda regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things product design  development  manufacture and testing  product labeling  product storage  pre market clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action which may include recalling products  ceasing product marketing  and paying significant fines and penalties 
one or more of these enforcement actions could limit product sales  delay product shipment and adversely affect our profitability 
we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections  which we have yet to undergo 
if we or any third party manufacturer of our products do not conform to applicable quality system regulations  we may be required to find alternative manufacturers  which could be a long and costly process 
before we can sell a new medical device in the us  we must obtain fda clearance or approval  which can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda through the pre market notification provisions of section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  we may be unable to maintain the necessary clearances in the future 
furthermore  we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we market in the future 
our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 
if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised  patient care could suffer  we could be liable for related damages  and our reputation could be impaired 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or 
table of contents similar disruptive problems 
if we fail to meet our clients expectations  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired 
in addition  patient care could suffer and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner 
our insurance may not protect us from this risk 
if compliance with government regulations of healthcare becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us  we may not be able to grow our business 
participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
furthermore  our healthcare service provider  payor and plan customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa may require us to make unplanned enhancements of software applications or services  result in delays or cancellations of orders  or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants 
the affect of hipaa on our business is difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 
in addition to medical device laws and regulations  numerous state and federal healthcare related laws regulate our business  covering areas such as storage  transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer  payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods  and the marketing and advertising of our products 
complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time consuming  and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 
we face risks related to our international sales  including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 
sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval  and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements 
we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future 
we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals 
if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us  or if we fail to receive these approvals  we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner  if at all 
we currently sell our products in europe  canada  the united kingdom  mexico  brazil  australia and hong kong  and may expand into other countries from time to time 
we do not know whether orthodontists  dentists and consumers outside our domestic market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 

table of contents our business exposes us to potential product liability claims  and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 
medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable 
although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance  adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management s attention away from the operation of our business  and could harm our business 
in fiscal  the market price for our common stock was highly volatile 
although the market price for our common stock has increased during fiscal  the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors include quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity  changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  strategic actions by our competitors  such as product announcements or acquisitions  and announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  class action litigation has often been brought against the issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
if a securities class action suit is filed against us in the future  we would incur substantial legal fees  and our management s attention and resources would be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 
future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 
a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders 
these stockholders have sold in the past  and may sell in the future  large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business 
in addition  certain of our current stockholders have registration rights in connection with a private placement sale of approximately million shares of our common stock that occurred in november as a result of these registration rights  we were required to file a registration statement under the securities act at our expense to register the securities sold in the november private placement 
we filed this registration statement with the sec on october  and it was declared effective by the sec on november  our stock price could fluctuate significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them 
these sales may also make it more difficult for us to sell securities in the future at a time and at a price we deem appropriate 

table of contents concentrations of ownership and agreements among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate transactions 
the interests of our management could conflict with those of our other stockholders 
as of december   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us  which in turn could reduce the market price of our stock 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations  primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk 
these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business 
we do not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of our marketable securities or our debt instruments 
we have no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risks on cash and cash equivalents  available for sale marketable securities  existing long term debts and any future financing requirements 
interest rate risks related to marketable securities are managed by monitoring maturities in our marketable securities portfolio 
our long term debt at december  consists of outstanding balances on capital lease obligations of million and a million equipment based term loan 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the marketable securities maturities do not exceed fiscal year and the interest rates are primarily fixed 
our capital lease obligations of million at december  carry fixed interest rates of and per annum  with principal payments due in and monthly installments  respectively  which began in in december  we obtained a million equipment based term loan which accrues interest at a rate of above prime 
in december we had drawn down million from the equipment based term loan 
principal payments are due in monthly installments which began in january the following table presents the future principal cash flows or amounts and related weighted average interest rates expected by year for our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term debt instruments expected maturity date as of december  total fair value in thousands assets cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities weighted average interest rate liabilities equipment based term loan fixed rate debt lease obligation weighted average interest rate qualitative disclosures interest rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to a decrease in the value of available for sale securities if market interest rates increase  our ability to pay long term debts at maturity  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations 
we have the ability to hold at least a portion of the fixed income investments until maturity 
as a result  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our short and long term marketable securities portfolio 

table of contents we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding long term debts through the use of fixed rate debt 
management evaluates our financial position on an ongoing basis 
currency rate risk 
our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to our decentralized or outsourced operations  whereby approximately million of our annual expenses are related to operations outside the united states  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not hedge any balance sheet exposures or intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the exposure related to currency rate movements would not likely have a material impact on future net income or cash flows for the foreseeable future
