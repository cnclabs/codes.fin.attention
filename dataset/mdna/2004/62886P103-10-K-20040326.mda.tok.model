item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the financial statements and data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap unless otherwise noted 
gaap differs from statutory accounting practices used by regulatory authorities in their oversight responsibilities of insurance companies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our net income and equity between gaap and statutory accounting bases 
critical accounting policies following is a discussion of key financial concepts and of those accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
that is  these are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most complex judgments  including the need to make estimates about the effect of insurance losses and other matters that are inherently uncertain 
premium income 
gross premiums written represent the amounts billed to policyholders 
gross premiums written are reduced by premiums ceded to reinsurers and renewal credits in determining net premiums written 
premiums ceded to reinsurers represent the cost to us of reducing our exposure to medical professional liability losses by transferring agreed upon insurance risks to reinsurers through a reinsurance contract or treaty 
renewal credits are reductions in premium billings to renewing policyholders 
net premiums written are adjusted by any amount which has been billed but not yet earned during the period in arriving at earned premiums 
extended reporting endorsements premium is earned in the same period it is written 
for several large groups of policyholders  we have insurance programs where the premiums are retrospectively determined based on losses during the period 
under all of the current programs  the full premium level is determined and billed at the inception of the policy term 
the premium level could potentially be reduced and a premium refund made if the program loss experience is favorable 
premiums billed under retrospective programs are recorded as premiums written  while premium refunds accrued under retrospective programs are recorded as unearned premiums 
under retrospective programs  premiums earned are premiums written reduced by premium refunds accrued 
premium refunds are accrued to reflect the risk sharing program results on a basis consistent with the underlying loss experience 
the program loss experience is that which is included in the determination of our losses and loss adjustment expenses lae 
as described more fully below  one component of the expense for losses and lae is the estimate of future payments for claims and related expenses of adjudicating claims 
unearned premiums represent premiums billed but not yet fully earned at the end of the reporting period 
premiums receivable represent annual billed and unbilled premiums which have not yet been collected 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we write one line of business  medical professional liability 
losses and lae reserves are estimates of future payments for reported claims and related expenses of adjudicating claims with respect to insured events that have occurred in the past 
the change in these reserves from year to year is reflected as an increase or decrease to our losses and lae expense incurred 
medical professional liability losses and lae reserves are established based on an estimate of these future payments as reflected in our past experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns 
other factors that modify past experience are also considered in setting reserves  including court decisions  economic conditions  current trends in losses  and inflation 
reserving for medical professional liability claims is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
although we intend to estimate conservatively our future payments relating to losses incurred  there can be no assurance that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
the estimation process is an extensive effort 
it begins in our claims department with the initial report of a claim 
for each claim reported  a case reserve is established by the claims department based on analysis of the facts of the particular case and the judgment of claims management 
this estimation process is not by formula but is driven by the investigation of facts combined with the experience and insight of claims management applied to each individual case 
the timing of establishing case reserves follows established protocols based on the underlying facts and circumstances on a case by case basis 
specific factors considered include the claimants assertion of loss  the amount of documented damages asserted  an expert medical assessment  the jurisdiction where the incident occurred  our experience with any similar cases in the past  as well as any other factors pertinent to the specific case 
each quarter  the aggregate of case reserves by report year is compiled and subjected to extensive analysis 
semiannually  our independent actuary performs an actuarial valuation of reserves based on the data comprising our detailed claims experience since inception 
the actuarial valuation entails application of various statistically based actuarial formulae  an analysis of trends  and a series of judgments to produce an aggregate estimate of our liability at the balance sheet date 
specific factors included in the estimation process include the level of case reserves by jurisdiction by report year  the change in case reserves between each evaluation date  historical trends in the development of our initial case reserves to final conclusion  expected losses and lae levels based on past experience relative to the level of premium earned  reinsurance treaty terms  and any other pertinent factors that may arise 
in consultation with our independent actuary  we utilize several methods in order to estimate losses and lae reserves by projecting ultimate losses 
by utilizing and comparing the results of these methods  we are better able to analyze loss data and establish an appropriate reserve 
our independent actuary provides a point estimate for loss reserves rather than a range of estimates 
the statistical accuracy of the actuarial estimate indicates that the actual ultimate value of reserved losses will be in the range of approximately plus or minus of the calculated point estimate 
the actuarial valuation of reserves is a critical component of the financial reporting process and provides the foundation for the determination of reserve levels 
in addition to reporting under gaap  we file financial statements with state regulatory authorities based on statutory accounting requirements 
these requirements include a certification of reserves by an appointed actuary 
the reserves in our statutory filings have been certified by an independent medical professional liability insurance actuary 
our ultimate liability will be known after all claims are closed  which is likely to be several years into the future 
for example  as of december   the oldest report date of an open claim is incurred losses for each report year will develop with a change in estimate in each subsequent calendar year until all claims are closed for that report year 
loss development could potentially have a significant impact on our results of operations 
developments changing the ultimate aggregate liability as little as could have a material impact on our reported operating results 
the inherent uncertainty in establishing reserves is relatively greater for companies writing long tail medical professional liability business 
each claim reported has the potential to be significant in amount 
for the three year period ended december   the average indemnity payment per paid closed claim was  with total indemnity payments of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cost of individual indemnity payments over this three year period ranged from  to million 
due to the extended nature of the claim resolution process and the wide range of potential outcomes of professional liability claims  established reserve estimates may be adversely impacted by judicial expansion of liability standards  unfavorable legislative actions  expansive interpretations of contracts  inflation associated with medical claims  lack of a legislated cap on non economic damages  and the propensity of individuals to file claims 
these risk factors are amplified given the increase in new business written in new markets because there is limited historical data available which can be used to estimate current loss levels 
we refine reserve estimates as experience develops and additional claims are reported or existing claims are closed  adjustments to losses reserved in prior periods are reflected in the results of the periods in which the adjustments are made 
losses and lae reserve liabilities as stated on the balance sheet are reported gross before recovery from reinsurers for the portion of the claims covered under the reinsurance program 
losses and lae expenses as reported in the statement of operations are reported net of reinsurance recoveries 
reinsurance 
we manage our exposure to individual claim losses  annual aggregate losses  and lae through our reinsurance program 
reinsurance is a customary practice in the industry 
it allows us to obtain indemnification against a specified portion of losses associated with insurance policies we have underwritten by entering into a reinsurance agreement with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
we pay or cede part of our policyholder premium to reinsurers 
the reinsurers in return agree to reimburse us for a specified portion of any claims covered under the reinsurance contract 
while reinsurance arrangements are designed to limit losses from large exposures and to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses  reinsurance does not relieve us of liability to our insureds 
under our current primary reinsurance contract  the premium ceded to the reinsurers is based on a fixed rate applied to policy premium for that coverage layer 
during the year  estimated payments are made to the reinsurers  and a final adjustment is made at the end of the year to reflect actual premium earned in accordance with the treaty 
for the years through  we retained risk exposure up to  for each and every claim 
beginning january   the retention level increased to  for each and every claim 
for and prior years  in accordance with one of our primary reinsurance contracts  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers was swing rated or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated cession program is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
a deposit premium is paid by us during the initial policy year 
an additional liability  retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties is recorded by us to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
like loss and lae reserves  adjustments to prior year ceded premiums payable to the reinsurers are reflected in the results of the periods in which the adjustments are made 
the swing rated reinsurance premiums are estimated in a manner consistent with the estimation of our loss reserves  and therefore contain uncertainties like those inherent in the loss reserve estimate 
our practice for accounting for the liability for retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties is to record the current year swing rated reinsurance premium at management s best estimate of the ultimate liability  which was generally the maximum rate payable under terms of the treaty 
due to the long tail nature of the medical professional liability insurance business  it takes several years for the losses for any given report year to fully develop 
since the ultimate liability for reinsurance premiums depends on the ultimate losses  among other things  it is several years after the initial reinsurance premium accrual before the amount becomes known 
during the intervening periods  reevaluations are made and adjustments to the accrued retrospective premiums are made as considered appropriate by management 
exposure to individual losses in excess of million is known as excess layer coverage 
excess layer premiums are recorded as current year reinsurance ceded costs 
under the excess layer treaties  prior to we ceded to our reinsurers over of our exposure 
effective since january   we cede of our risks and premiums related to these coverage layers 
investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is composed principally of fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale 
all securities with gross unrealized losses at the balance sheet date are evaluated for evidence of other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
we write down to fair value any security with an impairment that is deemed to be other than temporary in the period the determination is made 
the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
factors considered in the evaluation include but are not limited to interest rates  market related factors other than interest rates  and financial conditions  business prospects and other fundamental factors specific to the securities issuer 
declines attributable to issuer fundamentals are reviewed in further detail 
we have a security monitoring process which includes quarterly review by an investment committee comprised of members of our board of directors and representatives of policyholders 
our ceo and cfo also participate in the committee meetings in which our professional investment advisors review with the committee and management the analysis prepared by our investment manager of each security that has certain characteristics  reviewing deterioration of the financial condition of the issuer  the magnitude and duration of unrealized losses  and the credit rating and industry of the issuer 
the primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process involving judgments which is subject to risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition and the effects of changes in interest rates 
goodwill 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill ceased upon adoption of sfas on january  our goodwill asset  million as of december   resulted from the acquisition of three businesses which now operate as divisions of the practice management services segment 
we completed our initial goodwill impairment testing under sfas and concluded that the goodwill asset was not impaired as of the date of implementation of sfas  nor was it impaired as of december  the basic steps involved in the goodwill impairment test are identification of the reporting unit to be tested  and calculation of the current fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value 
if the current fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired 
because the acquired divisions are not publicly traded  a discounted cash value calculation is used to determine the current fair value of the unit 
estimates as to future performance of the divisions along with current market value indicators provide the basis for determination of the current fair value of the unit 
there is no guarantee of either the accuracy of the estimate of future performance of the divisions or of the accuracy of current market value indicators  since the real test of market value is what a potential acquirer is willing to pay 
recent industry performance our results of operations have historically been influenced by factors affecting the medical professional liability industry in general 
the operating results of the us medical professional liability industry have been subject to significant variations over time due to competition  general economic conditions  judicial trends and fluctuations in interest rates 
we actively monitor industry trends and consider them in relation to our circumstances when setting rates or establishing reserves 
the industry trends noted in the prior two years continued through and into the november december issue of contingencies  published by the american academy of actuaries  reported that the industry is now entrenched in the third medical malpractice crisis since the mid s  noting that the current crisis may be defined by st 
paul s decision to exit the market  followed by phico  reliance  frontier  and miix 
this articles concludes  among other things  that the driver of the crisis is a sustained jump in claims payments over a two year period  and that the data supports the premise that caps on noneconomic damages are an effective means of reducing malpractice costs 
according to the january best s review  published by am best  in  physicians across the country were faced with higher medical professional liability insurance premiums and fewer companies offering the coverage 
the escalation in premium rates in recent years is a reflection of rising frequency and severity of claims at a time when premium rates were depressed thereby exacerbating insurers poor operating performance 
the medical professional liability insurance marketplace is adjusting to the departure of the st 
paul companies  the largest medical professional liability insurer at that time  from the sector  while other companies have scaled back their market share or left some states entirely 
of the states identified by am best as having a crisis in medical care stemming from the lack of availability of medical professional liability insurance  only one west virginia falls into our market territory 
two of our other market jurisdictions  virginia and delaware  have been significantly impacted by the changes in market profile described by best s review 
in the january issue of best s review  am best predicted trends to include sustained price increases and worsening claims severity 
the realization of this prediction throughout and ultimately resulted in the change in the entire medical professional liability insurance market as a number of the insurance providers experienced adverse financial results and subsequently withdrew from the market 
medical professional liability lawsuits have been identified as a key factor in the rising cost of the us tort system according to an article in the february   issue of bestweek  a publication of am best 
the article further states that since  medical professional liability tort costs rose an average of a year  outpacing the average overall growth in tort costs of over the same period 
the february  issue of best s review reports that between and  median professional liability jury awards increased  causing a rise in medical professional liability insurance rates 
several of the jurisdictions in which we operate have not adopted tort reform  most notably the district of columbia which had the highest cumulative mean medical professional liability indemnity payment level for the ten year period ending december   according to the latest data available from the national practitioner data bank 
overview while financial results for were disappointing  we achieved significant accomplishments in we successfully deployed a significant amount of capital in our growth territories of delaware and virginia  with written premium increasing 
cash flow from operations was million in  a record level for ncric 
our business model is intact and we anticipate continued progress in and toward achieving our return on equity target 
the insurance premium rate structure for policies with effective dates is designed to produce a combined ratio of and a return on equity of deployed capital 
we restructured our investment portfolio to strengthen the overall credit quality of the fixed income portfolio and we diversified the portfolio to add a common stock equity component 
we merged the two companies writing insurance into one to achieve efficiencies within administrative operations 
a key aspect of the mission of our insurance business is to provide financial protection for our policyholders at rates that produce a fair return on capital invested by our shareholders 
a fundamental of profitable insurance business is appropriate pricing of our insurance policies 
two of the most important elements of premium rates are assumptions about costs of losses which will be sustained under the insurance contracts we issue and the investment income that will be generated by funds between the time of premium collection and claim payment 
both of these elements require us to make estimates of what will happen in the future 
we take a disciplined approach to develop the prices for our insurance policies  however  there is no assurance that we will accurately predict future developments of loss costs or investment returns 
as described in recent industry performance above  the tort environment continues to drive loss costs upward 
we believe that our many years of successful operation in the district of columbia  which over the past ten years has the highest mean indemnity payments of any jurisdiction  prepares us to successfully meet the challenges presented by the pressures in the judicial environment 
the adverse verdict in the hospital premium collection litigation is unfortunate 
we believe that the verdict was wrong 
since we believe the verdict was unfounded  we have not accrued any potential loss from this litigation 
consolidated net income years ended december   and year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income was a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to income of  for the year ended december  results were negatively impacted by adverse development of claims originally reported in earlier years 
the operating results of our insurance segment for the year ended december  were primarily driven by growth in new business written and the increase in the estimate of loss reserves for claims reported in prior years 
for the year  new business premium written was million compared to million for the new business written coupled with the increased premium rates resulted in a increase in net premiums earned 
the strain on current period earnings as a result of the large increase in new business written  combined with investment yield declines  resulted in pressure on short term profitability 
while the cost for claims reported in increased due to the rise in exposures  the development of losses for claims originally reported in and reduced pre tax earnings for the re estimation of losses was driven by two primary factors increases in the estimate of direct losses  primarily in virginia for the and report years  and a change in estimate of the level of reinsurance to be recovered for the losses reported in the years  and our practice management segment earnings in decreased compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in client revenue combined with a decrease in expenses 
client revenue decreases stem from a reduction in non recurring consulting assignments  as medical practice income comes under increasing pressure due to reductions in the payer system  physicians have less discretionary funds available for consultant engagements 
expense decreases are due to reductions in operating expense consistent with the changes in revenue levels 
since the size of our practice management business relative to our entire business has decreased as the insurance segment has increased  this business no longer meets the requirements for separate segment reporting 
therefore  we intend to not report this business as a separate segment in future periods 
three months ended december  compared to three months ended december  net income for the fourth quarter of was a loss of million compared to income of  in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter result was driven by adverse development of million on prior year losses in addition to an increased reserving level on losses 
the loss reserve development was estimated based on new information on specific losses and related revision of estimates of loss trends  primarily in report years and  combined with a re estimation of reinsurance to be recovered on losses in the  and report years based on actual development as those years mature 
related to the change in estimate of losses  the reinsurance premium on prior year losses covered by the swing rated reinsurance program was a charge of  in the fourth quarter of compared to a credit of  in the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  year to date results were negatively impacted by the increase in allowance for uncollectible premium receivable and unfavorable development of losses on claims reported in prior years 
net realized investment losses  after tax  for the year ended december  totaled  compared to net realized investment losses of  for the year ended december  the operating results of our insurance segment for the year ended december  were primarily driven by the following factors 
we continued to experience a significant increase in new business written in for the year  new business written excluding the ceded hca program  was million  up million or  from million for the rise in new business written coupled with the increased premium rates resulted in a increase in net premiums earned 
the strain on current period earnings as a result of the large increase in new business written  combined with investment yield declines  resulted in pressure on short term profitability 
while the cost for claims reported in increased due to the rise in exposure  the development of losses for claims originally reported in and reduced pre tax earnings for our practice management segment earnings in decreased compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in client revenue combined with an increase in expenses 
client revenue decreases stem from a reduction in non recurring consulting assignments  as medical practice income comes under increasing pressure due to reductions in the payer system  physicians have less discretionary funds available for consultant engagements 
expense decreases are due to the cessation of goodwill amortization due to the implementation of sfas beginning january   offset by expenses associated with the transition of client service for two of the former owners as they moved towards the expiration of their employment contracts at the end of and other transitional costs associated with the continued integration of the purchased companies

gross premiums written on excess layer coverage increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the change in unearned premiums for the period increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from net new business written throughout the year combined with premium rate increases 
gross premiums earned increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million for premiums earned under basic medical professional liability insurance and million for excess limits coverage 
extended reporting endorsements premium is earned in the same period as it is written 
reinsurance premiums ceded decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was the result lower reinsurance premium rates  partially offset by higher gross earned premiums and additional premium ceded related to prior years 
reinsurance premiums are affected by current year premiums payable to the reinsurers  as well as the retrospective adjustments to accruals for prior year premiums 
current year reinsurance premiums ceded decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to lower reinsurance premium rates charged by reinsurers as a result of the increase in ncric s retention level to million from  partially offset by the increase in gross earned premiums

loss development results from the re estimation and settlement of individual losses 
the change is due to an increase in the estimate of losses covered by the swing rated treaty in the and years 
the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development in the  and coverage years 
as claims are brought to conclusion  each year there are fewer outstanding claims in the years covered by this reinsurance treaty 
while the potential for loss development impacting this reinsurance coverage is reduced each year as the inventory of open claims is reduced  until all claims covered by the treaty are closed the potential remains for changes from current estimates 
as of december   there are open claims in the years covered by swing rated reinsurance compared to open claims as of december  the liability retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties increased to million at december  from million at december  renewal credits for the years ended december  and  reflect our decision to not provide a renewal premium credit for or renewals

new securities acquired brought current market rate yields into the portfolio  thereby reducing the overall portfolio yield 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net investment income decreased by  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year reflecting a decrease in yields partially offset by a higher base of average invested assets 
net investment income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  average invested assets  which include cash equivalents  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  new investments were primarily directed to corporate bonds  and tax exempt securities with the strategy of maximizing after tax returns with investment grade securities 
the average effective yield was approximately for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the tax equivalent yield was approximately at december  and at december  the change in investment yields is reflective of the market change in interest rates in compared to net realized investment gains losses year ended december  compared to year ended december  net realized investment gains were million for the year ended december  compared to net realized investment losses of  for the year ended december  the gains resulted from portfolio restructuring implemented by our new fixed income investment portfolio manager to replace weak credits with stronger rated bonds as well as from routine portfolio management activity  partially offset by the recognition of an other than temporary impairment loss of  on an investment in common stock 
the circumstance giving rise to the other than temporary impairment charge was a sharp decline in the value of the stock in  which we do not expect to be temporary based on available financial information of the issuer 
realized losses included an other than temporary impairment charge of  for a fixed maturity security issued by worldcom 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net realized investment losses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we repositioned our portfolio to replace weak credits with stronger rated bonds  realizing a net gain of  this partially offset the losses realized in prior quarters of in  we determined that one fixed maturity security  issued by worldcom  had experienced an other than temporary impairment  and recorded a pre tax investment loss of  reducing the carrying value to fair value during the second quarter when the determination was made 
additionally  in  we determined that an equity security consisting of common stock experienced an other than temporary impairment 
accordingly  we recorded a pre tax impairment loss of  in relating to that investment 
for securities sold during at a loss  the following is a summary of facts and circumstances related to the securities five securities  all corporate fixed maturities  were sold for consideration totaling million resulting in realized pre tax losses totaling million 
in  prior to the sale  these securities experienced a decline in fair value of million from december  three additional securities  all corporate fixed maturities  were sold for consideration totaling million  resulting in pre tax realized losses of approximately  the fair value of these securities had not changed significantly in compared to december  all of these securities were sold upon the recommendation of the outside investment manager  based upon the desire to maintain the overall credit quality of the portfolio or in response to the underlying business fundamentals relating to the securities 
finally  upon exercise of an issuer call option  one preferred stock produced consideration of million and a pre tax realized loss of  practice management and related income revenue for practice management and related services is comprised of fees for the following categories of services provided practice management  accounting  tax and personal financial planning  retirement plan accounting and administration  and other services 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this revenue consists of fees generated by ncric mso through its healthcare consulting and employee benefits services divisions 
the decreased revenue was primarily a result of a reduced level of non recurring and recurring assignments in the healthcare consulting division compared to additionally  in the later part of there was some loss of clients and revenue resulting from the departure from ncric of two consultants 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related revenues decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this revenue consists of fees generated by ncric mso through its healthcare consulting and employee benefits services divisions 
the decreased revenue was a result of a reduced level of non recurring consulting assignments in the healthcare consulting division compared to other income other income includes revenues from insurance brokerage  insurance agency and physician services  as well as service charge income from installment payments for our insurance premium billings 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increased revenue resulted primarily from service charge income from installment payments for our insurance premium billings 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increased revenue resulted primarily from increased brokerage reinsurance treaty commission income generated by the increased current year reinsurance ceded premiums and from services fees generated by premium installment payments 
in late we began offering an installment payment option to our insureds 
as a result  the revenue generated by service fees on installment payments grew throughout compared to losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and combined ratio results the expense for incurred losses and lae for each year is summarized as follows 
all loss expense amounts incurred are reported net of reinsurance amounts recoverable 
year ended december  in thousands incurred losses and lae related to current year losses    prior years loss development    total incurred for the year    traditionally  property and casualty insurer results are judged using ratios of losses and underwriting expenses compared to net premiums earned 
following is a summary of these ratios for each period 
year ended december  losses and lae ratio current year losses prior years loss development total losses and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the combined ratio and its component loss and underwriting expense ratios are profitability measures used throughout the insurance industry as a relative measure of underwriting performance 
insurance premium rates are designed to cover the costs of providing insurance coverage 
these costs include loss expenses arising from indemnity claims  costs required to adjudicate claims  and costs to issue and service insurance policies 
the calculations show the cost of each expense component as a percentage of earned premium income 
a general guide for interpreting the combined ratio is a lower ratio indicates greater profitability than does a higher ratio 
the resolution of some of the claims reported to us is determined through a trial 
following is a summary of the trial results for each period 
year ended december  plaintiff verdicts defense verdicts mistrials or hung juries total trials of the plaintiff verdicts in  four verdicts were awarded in excess of our  retention  and one verdict was in excess of our million retention limit 
under the clash protection provided by our reinsurance program  our exposure to the retention limit was limited to three of the five verdicts 
of the five plaintiff verdicts in  three verdicts were awarded in excess of our  retention 
of the five plaintiff verdicts in  one verdict was awarded in excess of our  retention 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total incurred losses and lae expense of million for year ended december  represents an increase of million compared to million incurred for the year ended december  the total incurred losses are broken into two components incurred losses related to the current coverage year and development on prior coverage year losses 
current year incurred losses increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting an increase in severity of reported claims  the rise in the level of liability exposure as a result of expanding business  and the increase in retention under our reinsurance program to million for each and every loss from  for each and every loss in prior year development results from the re estimation and resolution of individual losses not covered by reinsurance  which are generally losses under  in we experienced unfavorable development of million on estimated losses for prior years claims 
the re estimation of loss cost takes into consideration a variety of factors including recent claims settlement experience  new information on open claims  and changes in the judicial environment 
the primary factors driving our development  which is comprised of favorable development in the report year offset by adverse development in the  and report years  include additional information on claims originally reported in prior years and interpretation of emerging settlement trends in our expansion market areas 
the primary market territory driving the adverse loss development experience is virginia claims reported in and additionally  one claim in west virginia and maryland claims contributed to the adverse development 
in addition  the estimate of reinsurance recoverable  primarily on  and losses across all our market territories  declined 
an increase in severity was first noted in and continued through for claims reported in the district of columbia 
the increase in severity reflects the growing size of plaintiff verdicts and settlements 
our escalation in this adverse claims trend is similar to the conditions faced by many medical professional liability insurance carriers across the nation 
while an increase in severity would tend to cause loss ratios to deteriorate  our reinsurance program provides a layer of protection against the increase in severity of losses 
in the market territories outside of the district of columbia  or our expansion market areas  our experience covers a time period insufficient to make a complete determination on severity trends 
in these new market areas  we carefully evaluate developing data to identify and recognize emerging trends as soon as possible 
the total losses and lae ratio was increased by points for the year ended december  and was increased by points for the year ended december  as a result of prior years loss development 
the change is primarily reflective of favorable loss development for the report years  more than offset by adverse development in the  and loss years  whereas  the change is primarily reflective of favorable loss development for the and loss years  more than offset by adverse development in the  and loss years 
the underwriting expense ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  in underwriting expenses included million for a reserve against the hospital sponsored program receivable  as previously discussed 
a similar charge was unnecessary in  contributing points of improvement to the underwriting expense ratio 
underwriting expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in underwriting expenses was primarily attributable to the growth in expenses  consisting primarily of commissions  directly related to the expansion in business  consistent with the growth in premium 
the combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the primary factor driving the increased combined ratio was the adverse development of losses reported in prior years 
while adverse development directly contributed points of the increase  the experience on and adverse development was factored into the estimate of incurred losses  resulting in an increase in the current year component of the combined ratio 
the statutory combined ratio was for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  this increase stems from the same factors noted previously 
three months ended december  compared to three months ended december  three months ended december  in thousands incurred losses and lae related to current year losses   prior years loss development  total incurred for the quarter   current year losses prior years loss development total losses and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio current year losses in the fourth quarter of totaled  million increasing over the level of the fourth quarter of and over the level of the prior quarters of while the number of new claims reported in the fourth quarter was the lowest experienced in  the higher level of current year losses was established to take into consideration the prior year loss development trends that emerged during the year end actuarial valuation 
the loss ratio on current year losses at  higher than previous quarters in  reflects this recognition of higher severity 
additionally  the level of current year losses in was higher than in due to the increase in retention to million in from  in development on losses reported in prior years totaled million in the fourth quarter of this adverse loss development emerged during the fourth quarter from two primary sources o upward development on claims  primarily in virginia and maryland in and  and o lower estimate of reinsurance to be recovered on losses in the  and report years across all territories 
evaluations of individual claims are updated when additional information on each case is determined  often as a part of the preparation for trial 
case reserves on individual claims are raised when new information indicates a greater loss exposure 
actuarial reserves are established based on case reserves combined with historical loss development trends 
the upward development in the fourth quarter on case reserves of individual claims was not consistent with trends experienced previously 
therefore  in addition to the recognition of the upward development on individual claims  the actuarial estimates of losses were increased 
ncric s retention of losses in the  and report years is  for each and every loss 
the estimate of reinsurance amounts to be recovered from reinsurers is based primarily on historical trends  combined with information on individual claims 
in the first three quarters of ncric recognized in its losses a lesser estimate of reinsurance recoveries 
the revised estimate prepared as of year end further reduced the amount of estimated reinsurance recoveries on losses initially reported in prior years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total incurred losses and lae expense of million for year ended december  represented an increase of million  or  compared to million incurred for the year ended december  the total incurred losses are broken into two components incurred losses related to the current coverage year and development on prior coverage year losses 
current year incurred losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting the rise in the level of liability exposure as a result of expanding business  combined with a moderation of claims frequency 
prior year development results from the re estimation and resolution of individual losses not covered by reinsurance  which are generally losses under  in we experienced unfavorable development of million on estimated losses for prior years claims

the total losses and lae ratio was increased by points for the year ended december  and was decreased by points for the year ended december  as a result of prior years loss development 
the change is primarily reflective of favorable loss development for the and loss years  more than offset by adverse development in the  and loss years  whereas  the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development for the   and loss years  partially offset by adverse development in the loss year 
the underwriting expense ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is reflective of the reserve against the hospital sponsored program receivable of million  as previously discussed 
underwriting expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the increase in underwriting expenses  was attributed to the receivable allowance  this translates into an addition of to the underwriting expense ratio 
see underwriting expenses 
the combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the primary factor driving the increased combined ratio was the increase in underwriting expenses offset by a lower incurred loss ratio 
the statutory combined ratio was for the year ended december   and the same for the year ended december  this includes a slight decrease in the loss ratio offset by a slight increase in the expense ratio  reflecting the same premium  loss and expense factors noted previously 
losses and loss adjustment expenses liability the losses and lae reserve liabilities for unpaid claims as of each period are as follows at december  in thousands liability for loss   loss adjustment expense   total liability   reinsurance recoverable on losses 
  number of cases pending each case represents claims against one or more policyholders relating to a single incident 
losses in the medical professional liability industry can take up to eight to ten years  or occasionally more  to fully resolve 
amounts are not due from the reinsurers until we pay a claim 
we believe that all of our reinsurance recoverables are collectible 
see business reinsurance for a discussion on the reinsurance program 
underwriting expenses for  salaries and benefits accounted for approximately of other underwriting expenses  bad debt expense  with professional fees  including legal  auditing and director s fees  accounting for approximately of the underwriting expenditures 
premium taxes  guaranty assessments and commissions comprise the balance 
guaranty fund assessments are based on industry loss experience in the jurisdictions where we do business  and are not predictable 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  underwriting expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses primarily stems from the increase in new business  particularly agent produced business  through increases in commissions  travel  and other underwriting costs 
in addition  expenses increased for ceding allowances as a result of the change in the primary reinsurance treaty effective for  legal fees incurred for the collection litigation initiated by us as more fully discussed in the section net premiums earned  and  of expense resulting from a fraudulent act of a former sales agent 
although we believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional expense as a result of the fraudulent act  the amount or timing of any expense is not reasonably estimable at this time 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  underwriting expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses primarily stems from the increase in new business  particularly agent produced business  through increases in commissions  travel  and other underwriting costs 
these expenses were partially offset by an increase in ceding allowances as a result of the increase in premiums earned 
underwriting expenses also increased due to legal fees incurred for the collection litigation initiated by us and for the million addition to the allowance for uncollectible premiums  as more fully discussed in the section net premiums earned 
in addition  we received guaranty fund assessments totaling  stemming from the insolvency of phico insurance company 
there is the possibility we could be assessed additional amounts in the future 
however  since the amount of any potential future assessment is not reasonably estimable at this time  no additional expense accrual has been recorded 
practice management and related expenses practice management and related expenses consist primarily of expenses  such as salaries  general office expenses and interest on debt  related to ncric mso operations of the businesses acquired january  the management services organization was established in to provide physicians with a variety of administrative support and other services but did not have substantive operations until year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related expenses decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  expense decreased primarily due to reductions in staffing commensurate with the reductions in revenue 
a portion of this decrease stemmed from the elimination of costs associated with the transition of client service for two of the former owners as their employment contracts expired 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related expenses decreased  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  expense decreased due to the cessation of goodwill amortization with the implementation of sfas effective january  partially offset by additional expenses associated with the transition of client service for two of the former owners as they moved towards the expiration of their employment contracts at the end of and other transitional costs associated with the continued integration of the purchased companies 
interest expense interest expense was incurred for the debt service on the trust preferred securities issued in december  interest expense for the year ended december  totaled  a full year of interest  compared to  a partial month of interest in the prior year 
the interest rate in averaged and the interest rate in was 
other expenses other expenses include expenditures for holding company and subsidiary operations which are not directly related to the issuance of medical professional liability insurance or practice management and related operations  including insurance brokerage  insurance agency  and captive development 
in april  we announced the formation of acc  a wholly owned subsidiary and the first captive insurance company to be licensed in the district of columbia under the captive insurance act of as a captive insurance company  acc was established to provide an alternative risk financing vehicle for affinity groups 
the captive program is marketed to organizations and groups wishing to finance and manage their own risk

year ended december  compared to year ended december  other expenses of million for the year ended december  increased  or compared to the year ended december  expense increases are for captive business development costs and holding company operations 
income taxes our effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate principally due to nontaxable investment income 
year ended december  federal income tax at statutory rates 
tax exempt income dividends received goodwill amortization other  net income tax at effective rates our net deferred tax assets are created by temporary differences that will result in tax benefits in future years due to the differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
the primary difference is the requirement to discount or reduce loss reserves for tax purposes because of their long term nature 
at december  deferred income tax asset   year ended december  compared to year ended december  the tax benefit for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  a federal tax benefit was incurred in due primarily to the pre tax loss 
in addition  the effective tax benefit rate improved by due to tax exempt income 
the increase in the deferred income tax asset to a balance of million as of december  resulted primarily from the growth of the insurance business  particularly in unearned premiums and loss reserves where the timing of recognition for financial statement and tax return reporting differ 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the tax benefit for the year ended december  was  compared to tax expense of  for the year ended december  the federal corporate income tax rate of was adjusted to an effective tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  due to tax exempt income and nontaxable dividends 
the increase in the deferred income tax asset to a balance of million as of december  resulted primarily from the growth of the insurance business  particularly in unearned premiums and loss reserves where the timing of recognition for financial statement and tax return reporting differ  in addition to completion of the amortization of the deferred tax liability that had arisen from a change in tax accounting method four years ago 
the increase in the deferred income tax asset was partially reduced by the deferred tax liability on unrealized investment gains 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources ncric group  parent company financial condition and capital resources 
we are a stock holding company whose operations and assets primarily consist of our ownership of ncric  inc and ncric mso  inc we assist our subsidiaries in their efforts to compete effectively and create long term growth 
as a part of this strategy  we may seek to take advantage of acquisition opportunities and alternative financing 
second step conversion and public offering 
on june   a plan of conversion and reorganization was approved by the members of ncric  a mutual holding company and by the shareholders of ncric group  inc in the conversion and related stock offering  the mutual holding company offered for sale its ownership interest in ncric group 
as a result of the conversion and stock offering  the mutual holding company ceased to exist  and ncric group became a fully public company 
in the conversion and stock offering   shares of the common stock of ncric group were sold to eligible members  employee benefit plans  directors  officers and employees and to members of the general public in a subscription and community offering at per share 
the subscription stock offering period expired on june  all stock purchase orders received in the offering were satisfied 
as part of the conversion   shares were issued to the former public stockholders of ncric group 
the exchange ratio was new shares for each share of ncric group held by public stockholders as of the close of business on june  accordingly  after the conversion  ncric group had  shares outstanding 
in december  we completed the private placement sale of million of year floating rate trust preferred securities 
the securities are callable at par five years from the date of issuance 
the interest rate on the securities is floating at the month london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points 
the initial rate is 
we contributed million of the funds raised to the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries 
liquidity 
liquidity is a measure of an entity s ability to secure enough cash to meet its contractual obligations and operating needs 
our cash flow from operations consists of dividends from our subsidiaries  if declared and paid  and other permissible payments from our subsidiaries  offset by holding company expenses  which consist of costs for corporate management and interest on the trust preferred securities 
the amount of the future cash flow available to us may be influenced by a variety of factors  including ncric  inc s financial results and regulation by the district of columbia department of insurance  securities and banking 
the payment of dividends to us by ncric  inc is subject to limitations imposed by the district of columbia holding company system act of under the dc holding company act  ncric  inc must seek prior approval from the commissioner to pay any dividend which  combined with other dividends made within the preceding months  exceeds the lesser of a of the surplus at the end of the prior year or b the prior year s net income excluding realized capital gains 
net income  excluding realized capital gains  for the two years preceding the current year is carried forward for purposes of the calculation to the extent not paid in dividends 
the law also requires that an insurer s statutory surplus following a dividend or other distribution be reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
the district of columbia permits the payment of dividends only out of unassigned statutory surplus 
as of december   ncric  inc had approximately million of unassigned statutory surplus 
any dividend payment by ncric  inc would require the approval of the commissioner 
ncric group and subsidiaries  consolidated liquidity 
the primary sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums  net investment income  practice management and financial services fees  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
funds are used to pay losses and lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums  taxes  and to purchase investments 
we had cash flows provided by operations for the years ended december  as follows million million million comprehensive income was a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to income million for the year ended december  the decrease in comprehensive income results from the million decrease in net unrealized investment gains  combined with the million net loss for the year ended december  compared to the net income of million for the year ended december  financial condition and capital resources 
we invest our positive cash flow from operations primarily in investment grade  fixed maturity securities 
as of december   the carrying value of the securities portfolio was million  compared to a carrying value of million at december  the portfolios were invested as follows at december  us government and agencies us asset and mortgage backed securities 
tax exempt securities corporate bonds equity securities over of the bond portfolio at december  was invested in us government and agency securities or had a rating of aaa or aa 
the entire bond portfolio as of december  was held in investment grade bbb or better securities as rated by standard poor s 
for regulatory purposes  as of december   of the portfolio is rated class which is the highest quality rated group as classified by the naic 
the accumulated other comprehensive income totaled million at december  compared to million at december  this reduction in asset values resulted primarily from the portfolio restructuring undertaken in while the restructuring improved the overall asset quality of the bond portfolio  in general  securities with higher coupon interest rates were sold and securities with lower  market level  coupon rates were purchased 
the securities with higher coupon rates generally carry higher unrealized gains than do securities with lower coupon rates of interest 
at december   our portfolio included total gross unrealized gains of million  or of the million carrying value of the portfolio  and total unrealized losses of million  or less than of the carrying value of the portfolio 
the total unrealized losses are comprised of different securities  including nine treasury note issues  corporate debt and municipal bonds all of which are investment grade  with lengths of time to maturity ranging from two to years  and ten equity issues 
all of the fixed maturity securities are meeting and are expected to continue to meet all contractual obligations for interest payments 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the securities with unrealized losses was million  or of the aggregate carrying value of those securities of million 
the largest single security with an unrealized loss at december  relates to a fnma pool which matures in and carries a coupon rate of 
the unrealized pre tax loss relating to this security is approximately  based on the fair value of million at december  unrealized losses related to other securities are not individually significant  nor is there any concentration of unrealized losses with respect to the type of security or industry 
the following table displays characteristics of the securities with an unrealized loss in value as of december  no concentrations of industries exist in these securities 
total securities equity securities length of time in amortized fair unrealized amortized fair unrealized unrealized loss position cost value loss cost value loss in thousands less than year    over year total    the following table displays the maturity distribution of those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss in value as of december  fixed maturity securities amortized unrealized cost fair value loss in thousands during one year or less due after one year through five years   due after five years through ten years   due after twenty years   due after ten through twenty years   we believe that all of our fixed maturity securities are readily marketable 
investment duration is closely monitored to provide adequate cash flow to meet operational and maturing liability needs 
asset and liability modeling  including sensitivity analyses and cash flow testing  are performed on a regular basis 
we are required to pay aggregate annual salaries in the amount of  to four persons under employment agreements 
under terms of the purchase agreement between the previous owners of healthcare consulting  inc  hci ventures  llc  employee benefits services  inc 
and us  contingency payments totaling million could be paid in cash if the acquired companies achieved earnings targets in   and during june  ncric mso  inc borrowed  from suntrust bank to finance these payments 
the term of the loan is years at a floating rate of libor plus one and one half percent 
the interest rate was and at december  and december   respectively 
principal and interest payments are due on a monthly basis 
the unpaid balance as of december  was  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   in thousands over over three more one one year years to than year or to three five five total less years years years long term debt   operating leases    operating leases consist of office rental commitments 
the table excludes purchase obligations which consist of routine acquisitions of office supplies which represent minimal commitments generally spanning one month or less 
as an insurance company  we have liabilities for losses and related loss adjustment expenses in the normal course of business 
while these liabilities arise due to contractual obligations under the insurance policies we issue  the liabilities are estimates of amounts to be paid at undetermined future dates and are not included in this table 
our stockholders equity totaled million at december  and million at december  the million increase for the year ended december  was due primarily to million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock  partially reduced by the net loss of million and the reduction of million in net unrealized investment gains 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes the primary effect of inflation on us is in estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae for medical professional liability claims in which there is a long period between reporting and settlement 
the rate of inflation for malpractice claim settlements can substantially exceed the general rate of inflation 
the actual effect of inflation on our results cannot be conclusively known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  we believe that loss and lae reserve levels and our ratemaking process adequately incorporate the effects of inflation 
interest rate changes expose us to market risk on our investment portfolio 
this market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the decrease in the value or price of an asset resulting from broad movements in prices  such as interest rates 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuation in interest rates 
in addition  our net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes on monies re invested from maturing securities and investments of positive cash flow from operating activities 
federal income tax matters ncric group and its subsidiaries file a consolidated income tax return with the internal revenue service 
tax years  and are open but not currently under audit 
in the internal revenue service approved a change in accounting method for us relative to the timing of revenue recognition for tax purposes 
regulatory matters naic statutory accounting codification 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic is an association of the insurance regulators of all states and the district of columbia 
the naic has codified the statutory accounting practices  which are the accounting rules and guidelines prescribed by the state insurance regulators 
the project was intended to re examine current statutory accounting practices and to ensure uniform accounting treatment from a regulatory standpoint 
many of the changes to statutory accounting are based on generally accepted accounting principles with modifications that emphasize the concept of conservatism and solvency inherent in statutory accounting 
the accounting mandated by the codification applied commencing january  statutory accounting changes resulting from this codification do not have an effect on the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  which have been included in this document and filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the effect on our statutory surplus on january  was an increase of million 
this increase is mainly due to the effect of accounting changes related to the implementation of deferred taxes and the removal of the excess of statutory reserves over statement reserves penalty  offset by charges to surplus for overdue receivables 
naic iris ratios 
the naic insurance regulatory information system iris is an early warning system that is primarily intended to be utilized by state and district of columbia insurance department regulators to assist in their review and oversight of the financial condition and results of operations of insurance companies operating in their respective jurisdictions 
iris is a ratio analysis system that is administered by the naic 
the naic provides state and district of columbia insurance department regulators with ratio reports for each insurer within their jurisdiction based on standardized annual financial statements submitted by the insurers 
iris identifies ratios to be analyzed for a property casualty insurer  and specifies a range of values for each of these ratios 
the ratios address various aspects of each insurer s financial condition and stability including profitability  liquidity  reserve adequacy and overall analytical ratios 
departure from the usual range of a ratio may require the submission of an explanation to the state or district of columbia insurance regulator 
for our subsidiary cml was outside the usual range on three ratios 
the ratio results were impacted by two primary factors the rapid increase in new premium written in cml and the increase in severity of losses  particularly the adverse development in losses of one prior year 
for and  ncric  inc was outside the usual range for two ratios as the result of the rapid increase in premiums 
for ncric  inc was outside the usual range for five ratios as the result of the rapid increase in premiums  the adverse development of prior year losses  the decrease in yield on the investment portfolio  and the capital contribution from ncric group 
naic risk based capital 
the naic has established a methodology for assessing the adequacy of each insurer s capital position based on the level of statutory surplus and an evaluation of the risks in the insurer s product mix and investment portfolio profile 
this risk based capital rbc formula is designed to allow state and district of columbia insurance regulators to identify potentially under capitalized companies

the rbc rules provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the insurer s total adjusted capital to the authorized control level of rbc 
the first level of regulatory action  a review by the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a company prepared rbc plan  is instituted at the point a company s total adjusted capital is at a level equal to or less than two times greater than the authorized control level risk based capital 
for all periods presented  the total adjusted capital levels for ncric  inc and cml were significantly in excess of the authorized control level of rbc 
as a result  the rbc requirements are not expected to have an impact on our operations 
following is a presentation of the total adjusted capital for ncric  inc and cml compared to the authorized control level of rbc

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market price our investment portfolio is exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and equity price risk 
market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the decrease in the value or price of an asset resulting from broad movements in prices 
at december   fixed maturity securities comprised of total investments at fair value 
us government and agencies and tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity securities 
equity securities  consisting of common stocks  account for the remainder of the investment portfolio 
we have classified our investments as available for sale 
because of the high percentage of fixed maturity securities  interest rate risk represents the greatest exposure we have on our investment portfolio 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuation in interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  the fair value of our investment portfolio will generally decline resulting in decreases in our stockholders equity 
conversely  during periods of falling interest rates  the fair value of our investment portfolio will generally increase resulting in increases in our stockholders equity 
in addition  our net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes on monies reinvested from maturing securities and investments of positive cash flow from operating activities 
generally  the longer the duration of the security  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
to control the adverse effects of the changes in interest rates  our investment portfolio of fixed maturity securities consists primarily of intermediate term  investment grade securities 
our fixed income portfolio at december  reflected an average effective maturity of years and an average modified duration of years 
our investment policy also provides that all security purchases be limited to rated securities or unrated securities approved by management on the recommendation of our investment advisor 
all of our bond portfolio as of december  was held in investment grade securities 
one common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity securities is effective duration 
effective duration utilizes maturities  yields  and call terms to calculate an average age of expected cash flows 
the following table shows the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio based on fluctuations in the market interest rates 
projected market yield change value bp market yield in millions current yield current yield is as of december  the actual impact of the market interest rate changes on the securities may differ from those shown in the sensitivity analysis above
