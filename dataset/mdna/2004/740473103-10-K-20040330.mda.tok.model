table of contents caution about forward looking statements we make forward looking statements in this annual report that are subject to risks and uncertainties

the words believes  expects  may  will  should  projects  contemplates  anticipates  forecasts  intends  or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to significant uncertainties because they are based upon or are affected by factors including the ability to successfully manage our growth or implement our growth strategies if we are unable to identify attractive markets  locations or opportunities to expand in the future  maintaining capital levels adequate to support our growth  maintaining cost controls and asset qualities as we open or acquire new branches  reliance on our management team  including our ability to attract and retain key personnel  the successful management of interest rate risk  changes in general economic and business conditions in our market area  changes in interest rates and interest rate policies  risks inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values  competition with other banks and financial institutions  and companies outside of the banking industry  including those companies that have substantially greater access to capital and other resources  demand  development and acceptance of new products and services  problems with technology utilized by us  changing trends in customer profiles and behavior  and changes in banking and other laws and regulations applicable to us 
because of these uncertainties  our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking statements 
in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
financial overview at december  we had total assets of million  net loans of million  deposits of million and shareholders equity of million 
the increase in assets was over the amount at december   while net loans and deposits increased and  respectively  for the same period 
our earnings per share  on a fully diluted basis  for the year ended december  was  which represented an increase of  or  over earnings per share  on a fully diluted basis  of for the same period the increase is partially attributable to a increase in net interest income over the same periods  due to strong growth in our earning assets 
the increase is also attributable to a increase in non interest income  as service charge income and other fees provided recurring sources of income 
our return on average equity was for the period ended december  and has increased every year since we have been able to achieve this level without relying on a disproportionate share of income from mortgage banking operations 
our improvement has occurred as we have continued to grow through the opening of new branches 
our efficiency ratio has also increased during this growth in the past year  rising from at december  to for year end critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon 
table of contents our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
we discuss below those accounting policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimatable and sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses is determined by evaluating our loan portfolio on at least a quarterly basis 
particular attention is paid to individual loan performance  collateral values  borrower financial condition and overall economic conditions 
the evaluation includes a close review of the internal watch list and other non performing loans 
management uses three steps in calculating the balance of the allowance 
the first step is the specific classification which examines problem loans and applies a weight factor to each category 
the weight factor is based upon historical data and the loans within each category are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine changes in their status 
the second step applies a predetermined rate against total loans with unspecified reserves 
again  this rate is based upon experience and can change over time 
the third step is an unallocated allowance which is determined by economic events and conditions that may have a real  but as yet undetermined  impact upon the portfolio 
each of these steps is based on data that can be subjective and the actual losses may be greater or less than the amount of the allowance 
however  management feels that the allowance represents a reasonable assessment of the risk imbedded in the portfolio 
financial condition total assets the corporation s assets grew at a pace  ending the year at million 
total loans at year end  were million of which million were loans secured by real estate 
the remaining loans consisted of million in commercial loans  million in consumer installment loans and million in all other loans 
net loans for  were million  an increase of million or from the december  balance of million 
the loan to deposit ratio was for and as of december  steady loan demand in an expanding market  combined with continued low interest rates  generated the loan growth experienced for these conditions  along with the strong valley economy  combined with the anticipated growth from the new loan production office in martinsburg  west virginia  gives management the belief that the corporation will continue to see strong and increased loan demand for the immediate future 
the investment portfolio decreased to million at year end compared to million at december  given the anticipated demands on the corporation s capital to fund new loans and the loan production office in martinsburg  management has chosen not to replace all matured or called securities in the portfolio 
federal funds sold decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in federal funds sold was used to help fund the loan growth mentioned above 
total interest earning assets increased million or from december  to december  this increase was primarily the result of the increase in outstanding loan balances

the net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average earning assets

net interest margin is affected by changes in both average interest rates and average volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for the year ending december  was million  million or higher than the year ending this increase is the result of the growth in average earning assets of million in the combination of growth and rate changes had the effect of decreasing the net interest margin from at year end to for the same period of net interest income for the year ended december  was million  million or higher than the year ended december  this increase is the result of the growth in average earning assets of million in the combination of growth and rate changes had the effect of increasing the net interest margin from at year end to for the same period of as is the case with most financial institutions  premier is liability sensitive for interest bearing balances re pricing or maturing within one year

the average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and enforcement of due on sale clauses  which gives us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
in addition  certain borrowers increase their equity in the security property by making payments in excess of those required under the terms of the mortgage

table of contents asset quality asset quality is an important factor in the successful operation of a financial institution 
banking regulations require institutions to classify their own assets and to establish prudent general allowances for losses for assets classified as substandard or doubtful 
for the portion of assets classified as loss  an institution is required to either establish specific allowances of of the amount classified or charge such amounts off its books 
the accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is days delinquent unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
we place loans on non accrual status at an earlier date  or we charge them off  if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on non accrual or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until they qualify for a return to accrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
allowance for loan losses we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a sufficient level to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
loan losses are charged directly to the allowance when they occur  while recoveries are credited to the allowance 
specific reserves by loan type are established based on overall historical losses  anticipated losses  and inherit risk 
additionally  specific reserves for individual loans are established depending on the severity of the potential loss 
loans are individually reserved once classified as a watch item by management 
a higher percentage of the loan is reserved for individual loans with a more severe classification 
the adequacy of the provision for loan losses is reviewed regularly by management through consideration of several factors including changes in character and size of the loan portfolio and related loan loss experience  a review and examination of overall loan quality which includes the identification and assessment of problem loans and an analysis of anticipated economic conditions in the market area 
the allowance for loan losses  at december   was million 
this is an increase of thousand or from december  the increases in our allowance for loan losses are the result of adjustments that management has made in response to the growth of our loan portfolio

the corporation s management and board of directors have reviewed the asset quality of marathon s and rockingham heritage s loan portfolios and both loan loss allowances and have found them to be adequate 
the following table details information concerning non accrual loans  foreclosed properties and past due loans as of december for each of the years indicated december  in s non accrual loans foreclosed properties loans past due days or more and still accruing interest sources of funds deposits we primarily use deposits to fund our loans and investment securities 
we offer individuals and small to medium size businesses a variety of deposit accounts 
deposit accounts  including checking  savings  money markets and certificates of deposit  are obtained primarily from the communities which we serve 
we attract both short term and 
table of contents long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide assortment of accounts and rates 
we offer statement savings accounts  various checking accounts  various money market accounts  fixed rate certificates with varying maturities and individual retirement accounts 
at december   deposits were million  an increase of from million at december  the deposit growth is a reflection of branch office growth  aggressive pricing  increased marketing and bank consolidation in our principal market 
in order to reduce the overall cost of funds and reduce our reliance on high cost time deposits and short term borrowings as a funding source  we continue to direct marketing efforts towards attracting lower cost transaction accounts 
however  there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful  or if successful  will reduce our reliance on time deposits and short term borrowings

further  the corporation does bid for selected public funds deposits in large denominations  and such deposits may require a pledging of investment securities 
the corporation competes with the major regional financial institutions for money market accounts and certificates of deposits less than  while the corporation is competitive with its interest rates  using a tiered rate system to increase individual account balances  the corporation has found that it can continue to maintain a higher interest margin than its peers by matching loan maturities with certificate maturities and setting loan rates based on the corporation s cost of funds 

table of contents borrowings the corporation had no short term borrowings with an average balance outstanding of more than of stockholders equity for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital reserves liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future obligations in a timely manner

in addition  our banks have the ability to borrow additional funds from various sources 
short term borrowings are available from federal funds facilities at correspondent banks and from the discount window of the federal reserve bank

the provisions of the statement were effective december  management currently intends to continue to account for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value method set forth in accounting principles board apb opinion and related interpretations 
for this reason  the transition guidance of sfas no 
does not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations

in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of the interpretation were effective beginning january  the initial adoption of the interpretation did not materially affect the company  and management does not anticipate that the recognition requirements of this interpretation will have a materially adverse impact on either the company s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations in the future

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation provides guidance with respect to the identification of variable interest entities and when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a variable interest entity need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
the interpretation requires consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities in cases where a the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  or b in cases where the equity investors lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  which include the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights  the obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
management has evaluated the corporation s investments in variable interest entities and potential variable interest entities or transactions  particularly in limited liability partnerships involved in low income housing development and trust preferred securities structures 
the implementation of fin did not have a significant impact on either the corporation s consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
interpretive guidance relating to fin is continuing to evolve and the corporation s management will continue to assess various aspects of consolidations and variable interest entity accounting as additional guidance becomes available

many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities 
adoption of the statement did not result in an impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on a new disclosure requirement related to unrealized losses on investment securities 
the new disclosure requires a table of securities which have unrealized losses as of the reporting date 
the table must distinguish between those securities which have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more and those securities which have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
the table is to include the aggregate unrealized losses of securities whose fair values are below book values as of the reporting date  and the aggregate fair value of securities whose fair values are below book values as of the reporting date 
in addition to the quantitative disclosure  fasb requires a narrative discussion that provides sufficient information to allow financial statement users to understand the quantitative disclosures and the information that was considered in determining whether impairment was not other than temporary 
the new disclosure requirements apply to fiscal years ending after december  the corporation has included the required disclosures in their consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued a revised version of sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
 and this statement revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
it does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by fasb statements no 
 no 
 and no 
this statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in the original fasb statement no 
 which it replaces 
however  it requires additional disclosures to those in the original statement about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit costs of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans 
the disclosures for earlier annual periods presented for comparative purposes are required to be restated for a the percentages of each major category of plan assets held  b the accumulated benefit obligation  and c the assumptions used in the accounting for the plans 
this statement is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after december  the interim period disclosures required by this statement are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the corporation has included the required disclosures in its consolidated financial statements 
the corporation does not have any plans that meet the criteria of sfas no 
and therefore does not have any disclosure requirements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general an important element of both earnings performance and liquidity is the management of our interest sensitive assets and our interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within specific time intervals and the risks involved with them 
market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
our market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the asset and liability management committee at each bank is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk 
our board of directors reviews the guidelines established by each committee 

table of contents interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complimentary modeling tools static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and economic value simulation net present value estimation 
each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios 
while each of the interest rate risk measures has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of our interest rate risk  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap  which measures aggregate repricing values  is less utilized since it does not effectively measure the earnings impact on us 
earnings simulation and economic value models  however  which more effectively reflect the earnings impact  are utilized by management on a regular basis 
earnings simulation analysis we use simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net income to changes in interest rates 
the model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process  but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other analysis such as the static gap analysis 
assumptions used in the model  including loan and deposit growth rates  are derived from seasonal trends and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project the yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are accounted for in the different rate scenarios 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on our net income using different rate scenarios as of december  there have been no material changes in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk since this information was developed using december  data 
change in prime rate change in net income basis points basis points basis points most likely basis points basis points basis points economic value simulation we use economic value simulation to calculate the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities over different interest rate environments 
economic values are calculated based on discounted cash flow analysis 
the economic value of equity is the economic value of all assets minus the economic value of all liabilities 
the change in economic value of equity over different rate environments is an indication of the longer term repricing risk in the balance sheet 
the same assumptions are used in the economic value simulation as in the earnings simulation 

table of contents the following chart reflects the change in net market value by using december  data  over different rate environments with a one year horizon 
change in prime rate change in economic value of equity dollars in thousands basis points basis points basis points most likely basis points basis points basis points management of the interest sensitivity gap the interest sensitivity gap is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time interval 
the gap can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  by selling investments  by replacing an asset or liability prior to maturity  or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
matching the amounts of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net income due to changes in market interest rates 
we evaluate interest rate risk and then formulate guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease sensitivity risk 
these guidelines are based upon management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
our asset and liability committees review deposit pricing  changes in borrowed money  investment and trading activity  loan sale activities  liquidity levels and the overall interest sensitivity 
the actions of the committees are reported to the boards of directors regularly monthly by marathon and quarterly by rockingham heritage 
the daily monitoring of interest rate risk  investment and trading activity  along with any other significant transactions are managed by the presidents of each bank with input from other committee members
