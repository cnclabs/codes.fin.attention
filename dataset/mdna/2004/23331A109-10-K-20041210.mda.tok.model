item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies general a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton  inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september  and  and for the years ended september   and each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises generally accepted accounting principles gaap for public companies operating in the united states of america 
in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap  we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business  the results of our operations and our financial condition  and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements 
the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 
basis of presentation our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton  inc and all of its wholly owned  majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts  transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts  under the requirements of interpretation no 
issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
segment information our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services 
our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling single family housing in states and markets throughout the united states 
the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets 
we have no foreign subsidiaries or operations 
revenue recognition we recognize homebuilding revenues when a home closes and title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer 
virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing 
we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash 
when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers  or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes  upgrades or options related to their homes  we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled 
we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts  depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract 
we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
we transfer all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third party insurers 
we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
origination fees  net of direct origination costs  are deferred and recognized as revenues  along with the associated gains and losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold 
we sell all mortgage loans and related servicing rights to third party investors 
inventories and cost of sales we state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and home construction  inventory costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction 
applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete  such as utilities  maintenance  and cleaning  are charged to selling  general and administrative sg a expense as incurred 
all indirect overhead costs  such as compensation of construction superintendents  sales personnel and division and region management  advertising and builder s risk insurance are charged to sg a expense as incurred 

table of contents we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs 
cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project 
any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project 
when a home is closed  we generally have not yet paid and recorded all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month 
we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home 
we monitor the accuracy of each month s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued 
although actual costs to be paid on closed homes in the future could differ from our current estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
each quarter  we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable 
if our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the sfas no 
guidelines  we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter 
to date  such impairment losses have been insignificant in the aggregate 
fair value estimation under sfas no 
involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and  due to uncertainties in the estimation process  actual results could differ from such estimates 
consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities as amended fin 
fin provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities  which fin defines as certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities 
fin requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities residual returns or both  defined as the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
under such option purchase contracts  we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right  but not the obligation  to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms 
under the terms of the option purchase contracts  many of our option deposits are non refundable 
certain non refundable deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity under the requirements of fin as such  certain of our option purchase contracts result in the acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option 
in applying the provisions of fin  we evaluate those land and lot option purchase contracts with variable interest entities to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary based upon analysis of the variability of the expected gains and losses of the entity 
based on this evaluation  if we are the primary beneficiary of an entity with which we have entered into a land or lot option purchase contract  the variable interest entity is consolidated 
since we own no equity interest in any of the unaffiliated variable interest entities that we must consolidate pursuant to fin  we generally have little or no control or influence over the operations of these entities or their owners 
when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers  certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities of such entities are required 
in most cases  the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been assumed to be the remaining contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are purchasing 
in these cases  it is assumed that the entities have no debt obligations and the only asset recorded is the land or lots we have the option to buy with a related offset to minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity 
creditors  if any  of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 

table of contents warranty costs we have established warranty reserves by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed 
we estimate the amounts charged to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods 
the one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor  the ten year period is for major construction defects 
our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
insurance claim costs we have  and require the majority of our subcontractors to have  general liability and workers compensation insurance 
these insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims  subject to certain self insured retentions  deductibles and other coverage limits 
we reserve for costs to cover our self insured and deductible amounts under those policies and for any estimated costs of claims and lawsuits in excess of our coverage limits or not covered by our policies  based on an analysis of our historical claims  which includes an estimate of construction defect claims incurred but not yet reported 
projection of losses related to these liabilities is subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products we build  claim settlement patterns  insurance industry practices  and legal interpretations  among others 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated reserve amounts  actual future costs could differ significantly from our currently estimated amounts 
interest rate swaps we have two interest rate swap agreements with a major united states bank under which we receive each quarter the london inter bank offered rate libor and pay a fixed amount that averages on a total notional amount of million 
we entered into both of the ten year swap contracts in because we were unwilling to buy out the bank s current right to cancel each swap during any quarter in which libor exceeds  we chose not to designate the swaps as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
as a result  even though they still protect us to some extent from increases in variable interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility  we are required to record the changes in their market value in our income statement each quarter 
at the end of each quarter  the swaps market value will have changed depending upon the market s current anticipation of quarterly libor rate levels from the present until the swaps maturity in the swaps market values generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future libor rates 
any future reductions in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future reductions in their market value and charges to our income statements 
similarly  any future increases in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future increases in their market value and increases in our reported earnings 
we cannot predict the changes in either future libor rates or the market values of our swaps 
goodwill we adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal under its provisions  we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings 
such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption goodwill 
sfas no 
requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded 
we have measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units is greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill exists 
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 
require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs 
due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates  actual results could differ from such estimates 
stock based compensation with the approval of a committee consisting of independent members of our board of directors  we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock 
the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders 
we grant approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant 
the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period 
we account for options under the provisions of accounting principles board 
table of contents apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  recognize no compensation expense for the grants 
sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
require us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
the sfas no 
requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date 
in march  the fasb issued a proposed statement of financial accounting standard which would amend sfas no 
and require companies that issue share based payments to record compensation expense based on the fair value of the share based payment 
we will adopt the proposed statement when it becomes effective  and we do not expect this change in accounting principle to materially affect our results of operations in future periods 
results of operations overview we experienced significant increases in revenues and earnings during the fiscal years ended september  and  driven primarily by the continued growth of our homebuilding operations and by significant improvements in homebuilding profit margins 
the demand from first time and move up homebuyers has remained favorable 
population growth  demographics  immigration  household formations and changes in home ownership rates were the primary long term factors driving this housing demand  with particular strength in our southeast  southwest and west regions 
low mortgage rates were a positive influence on housing demand during and  during a period of generally weak employment levels 
in addition  because the homebuilding industry in the united states is highly fragmented  we have been able to capitalize on the benefits of our size  such as our capital strength and access to lower material  labor and capital costs  to generate continued growth by increasing market share 
the mortgage industry was negatively impacted by a decline in loan refinancing activity during this resulted in increased competitive conditions and lower margins in the mortgage markets  including the market for mortgage loans for new home construction 
key financial highlights for our fiscal years ended september  and were as follows homebuilding operations our homebuilding operations generated year over year increases in the value of net new sales orders  homes closed and revenues exceeding in both fiscal and homebuilding operating margins increased by and percentage points during fiscal and  respectively  due to improvements in homebuilding gross margins and control of overhead costs 
homebuilding pre tax income increased and in fiscal and  respectively 
our sales backlog at september  was billion  a fiscal year end record and higher than our backlog at september  homebuilding debt to total capitalization net of cash  which is calculated as homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus stockholders equity  was at september   an improvement of percentage points from the prior year  and an all time low for the company 
financial services operations total financial services revenues increased and in fiscal and  respectively  reflecting the focus of our mortgage and title operations on supporting our growing homebuilding 
table of contents business  offset by the effects of increased competition in the mortgage industry for new home loans in fiscal financial services pre tax income declined by in fiscal after having increased by in fiscal  due to lower operating margins caused by the competitive conditions in the mortgage industry and changes in the product mix of mortgage loans originated and sold in consolidated results net income increased and in fiscal and  respectively  due to the improvements in consolidated revenues and homebuilding operating margins 
diluted earnings per share increased and for fiscal and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  as compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increases in our effective income tax rates in and were due primarily to increases in pre tax income in states with higher state income tax rates 
our operating strategy for fiscal and future years is to take advantage of opportunities to grow our homebuilding business  while continuing to generate profitability improvements and maintaining a strong balance sheet 
we plan to execute our growth strategy primarily by investing our available capital in our existing homebuilding markets through our capital allocation process

capital resources and liquidity we fund our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or equity securities 
as we utilize our capital resources and liquidity to fund the growth of our operations  we focus on maintaining strong balance sheet leverage ratios 
at september   our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital was  an improvement of percentage points from at september  homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by total capital homebuilding notes payable net of cash 
table of contents plus stockholders equity 
our stockholders equity to total assets ratio increased percentage points  to at september   from at september  we believe that we will be able to continue to fund our homebuilding and financial services operations and our future cash needs including debt maturities through a combination of our existing cash resources  cash flows from operating activities  our existing credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities through the public debt markets 
homebuilding capital resources cash at september   our available homebuilding cash and cash equivalents amounted to million 
bank credit facility in march  we restructured and amended our existing unsecured revolving credit facility  increasing it to billion and extending its maturity to march  the new facility included a million letter of credit sub facility and an uncommitted million accordion feature that permitted an increase in the facility 
in june  we exercised the accordion feature and obtained commitments from our lenders that increased the total size of the facility to billion 
the facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 
we had no outstanding cash borrowings on our homebuilding revolving credit facility at september  and under the debt covenants associated with our revolving credit facility  our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under the facility is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility  billion at september   or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement 
under the borrowing base limitation  the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our unencumbered inventory 
at september   the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to billion 
at september   we were in compliance with all of the covenants  limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility 
shelf registration statements at september   we had the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to billion under our universal shelf registration statement 
after the october issuance of million of senior notes due  our remaining capacity to issue new debt or equity securities was billion 
also  at september   we had the capacity to issue approximately million shares of common stock under our acquisition shelf registration statement  to effect  in whole or in part  possible future business acquisitions 
financial services capital resources cash at september   we had available financial services cash and cash equivalents of million 
mortgage warehouse loan facility in april  our wholly owned mortgage company restructured and amended its mortgage warehouse loan facility  increasing the facility to million and extending its maturity to april  this loan facility was amended on september  for a day period  temporarily increasing the facility to million to provide for increased year end closing volume 
at september   we had borrowings of million outstanding under the mortgage warehouse facility 
commercial paper conduit facility our wholly owned mortgage company also has a million commercial paper conduit facility the cp conduit facility  which expires on june  the terms of the facility are renewable annually by the sponsoring banks 
at september   million had been drawn under the cp conduit facility 

table of contents the mortgage warehouse loan facility and the cp conduit facility are not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt 
borrowings under both facilities are secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale 
the mortgage loans pledged to secure the cp conduit facility are used as collateral for asset backed commercial paper issued by multi seller conduits in the commercial paper market 
at september   our total mortgage loans held for sale were million 
all mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility  the cp conduit facility or internally generated funds 
both of the financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in compliance 
operating cash flow activities during the year ended september   we used million of cash in our operating activities  as compared to million of cash provided by operations during the prior year  resulting in net cash provided from operating activities of million for the two years ended september  both the net cash used in operations in fiscal and the net cash provided by operations in fiscal were the result of cash provided from net income and increases in accounts payable and other liabilities  offset by cash used to increase inventories  mortgage loans held for sale and other assets  reflecting the growth of our homebuilding and financial services operations 
the variance in operating cash flows from to is a direct result of our decision to invest billion of cash to fund inventory growth in fiscal versus a billion cash investment in inventory growth in fiscal a large portion of our cash invested in inventories represents purchases of land and lots that will be used to generate revenues and cash flows in future years 
since we control the amounts and timing of our investments in land and lots based on our inventory growth goals and our market opportunities  we believe that cash flows from operating activities before inventory additions is currently a better indicator of our liquidity 
investing cash flow activities in fiscal and  cash used in investing activities represented net purchases of property and equipment  primarily model home furniture and office equipment 
such purchases are not significant relative to our total assets or cash flows  and they typically do not vary significantly from year to year 
financing cash flow activities the majority of our short term financing needs are funded with cash generated from operations and funds available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities 
long term financing needs are generally funded with the issuance of new senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets 
our homebuilding senior and senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 
in january  we issued million of senior notes due on june   we used the majority of the proceeds of the issue to repay at maturity the million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes 
in july  we issued million of senior notes due in september  we issued million of senior notes due we used the proceeds from both of these offerings to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in october  we issued million of senior notes due we used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes  including land acquisition and development  home construction and homebuilding operations and other working capital needs 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of per common share split adjusted  and three quarterly cash dividends of per common share  the last of which was paid on august  to stockholders of record on august  on october

as of september  and  we had million remaining of the board of directors authorization for repurchases of common stock and million remaining of the authorization for repurchases of debt securities 
contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under short term and long term debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases 
purchase obligations of our homebuilding segment represent specific performance requirements under lot option purchase agreements that may require us to purchase land contingent upon the land seller meeting certain obligations 
we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through our operating cash flows  our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities and by issuing senior notes 
our future cash requirements for contractual obligations as of september  are presented below payments due by period less than more than year years years years total in millions homebuilding notes payable operating leases purchase obligations totals financial services notes payable operating leases totals at september   our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of million and surety bonds of  million  issued by third parties  to secure performance under various contracts 
we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms 
when we complete our performance obligations  the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter  leaving us with no continuing obligations 
we have no material third party guarantees 
to meet the financing needs of our customers  our mortgage operations extend interest rate lock commitments irlcs to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and meet defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  the irlcs have a duration of less than six months 
some irlcs are 
table of contents committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors 
we manage interest rate risk related to our uncommitted irlcs through the use of forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbs and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments 
as of september   our irlcs totaled million  and we had approximately million outstanding of fmbs and million of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments related to our irlcs 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at september   we had million in deposits to purchase land and lots with a total remaining purchase price of billion  of which only million is subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land seller meeting certain obligations 
pursuant to fin  we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of million 
land and lot position and homes in inventory at september   we controlled approximately  lots  of which were lots under option or similar contracts 
the following is a summary of our land lot position at september as of september  finished lots owned lots under development owned total lots owned lots controlled under lot option and similar contracts total land lots controlled percentage controlled under option the percentage of our lots controlled under option contracts increased during as our operating divisions used our position as a large  national homebuilder to negotiate favorable land acquisition terms that utilize our capital efficiently and mitigate our land ownership risks 
at september   we had a total of approximately  homes under construction  including approximately  model homes and less than unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months 
at september   we had a total of approximately  homes under construction  including approximately  model homes and less than unsold homes that had been completed for more than six months 
inflation we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land  financing  labor and material construction costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates can significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers 
we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 

table of contents safe harbor statement and risks certain statements contained in this report  as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission  statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts  stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us  may be construed as forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements typically include the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or other words of similar meaning 
any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may not approximate actual experience  and the expectations derived from them may not be realized  due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forward looking statements 
the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us 
other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us 
general economic  real estate and other conditions the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as employment levels  housing demand  availability of financing for homebuyers  interest rates  consumer confidence and the effects of terrorist acts or threats or responses to them 
any oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and used homes  could depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sale of new homes 
homebuilders are also subject to inventory risks related to anticipating consumer demand and supply and risks related to the availability and cost of land suitable for homebuilding  the availability and cost of materials and labor and adverse weather conditions and natural disasters 
as a result  in the future  potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes  or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them 
in addition  some home buyers may cancel or not honor their home sales contracts altogether 
increases in interest rates or decreases in mortgage availability virtually all of our customers finance their homes through lenders providing mortgage financing 
any future increases in interest rates  decreases in the availability of mortgage financing  or curtailment of the liquidity provided to the mortgage markets by fannie mae and freddie mac could adversely affect the ability of our customers to obtain financing 
this could adversely affect sales of our homes by making our homes less affordable 
governmental regulations and environmental matters we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect land development and home construction  including zoning  density and building standards 
such regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding 
new housing developments can also be subject to assessments for public improvements and property taxes  which can be substantial 
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment can cause delays  increased costs of compliance and prohibitions or restrictions of development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas 
all of these factors can cause increases in the prices of our homes and adversely affect sales of our homes 
competitive conditions the homebuilding industry is very competitive 
in each of the markets we serve  we compete with other homebuilders for homebuyers  desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled labor 
competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  the need for increased selling incentives  lower sales or profit margins or delays in construction 
warranty and product liability claims we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
as a consequence  we maintain product liability insurance  obtain indemnities and certificates of insurance from subcontractors generally covering claims related to workmanship and materials and create warranty reserves for the homes 
table of contents we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the types of homes built 
because of the uncertainties inherent to these matters  we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage  our subcontractor arrangements and our reserves will be adequate to address all of our warranty and construction defect claims in the future 
contractual indemnities can be difficult to enforce  we may be responsible for applicable self insured retentions and some types of claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits 
additionally  the coverage offered by and availability of product liability insurance for construction defects is currently limited and costly 
we have responded to the recent increases in insurance costs and coverage limitations by increasing our self insured retentions and claim reserves 
there can be no assurance that coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly 
substantial debt we have a significant amount of debt 
the amount of our debt could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other requirements 
it could require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service rather than for other purposes 
it could also limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions 
availability of capital our ability to grow our business and operations profitably is substantially dependent upon our ability to generate or obtain capital 
important sources of capital have included the sale of equity or debt and additional bank borrowings 
increases in interest rates  changes in our debt ratings by the national credit rating agencies  concerns by potential investors about the market or the economy  changing lending objectives of financial institutions  or further consolidation of financial institutions that lend to the homebuilding industry could increase our costs of borrowing or reduce the availability of funds necessary for us to achieve our strategic growth objectives 
moreover  the indentures for many of our outstanding notes contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future 
growth strategies since  we have acquired many homebuilding companies 
although we are currently focusing on internal growth  we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future 
successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available 
although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past  we can give no assurance that  when we resume our acquisition activity  we will be able to successfully identify  acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future 
moreover  we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and growth strategies within our existing markets 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt 
we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings 
we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance  repurchase or repay such debt 

table of contents our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under sfas no 
when it was adopted on october  we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps  and such changes must be reflected in our income statements 
our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services 
interest rate lock commitments irlcs are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  the irlcs have a duration of less than six months 
some irlcs are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  while other irlcs are funded prior to being committed to third party investors 
forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbs are used to protect uncommitted irlcs against the risk of changes in interest rates 
fmbs related to irlcs are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments  with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
fmbs related to funded  uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges  with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings  along with changes in the value of the funded  uncommitted loans 
the effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness  which for the years ended september   and was not significant  is recognized in current earnings 
at september   total fmbs to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlcs totaled million 
uncommitted irlcs totaled approximately million  the duration of which was less than six months and uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale totaled approximately million 
at september   the fair value of the fmbs and irlcs was an insignificant amount
