item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
radioshack is primarily a retailer of consumer electronics and services 
we seek to differentiate ourselves from our various competitors by focusing on dominating cost effective solutions to meet everyone s routine electronics needs and families distinct electronics wants 
this strategy allows us to take advantage of the unique opportunities provided by our extensive retail presence  specially trained sales staff and relationships with reputable vendors 
we believe this strategy provides us with the opportunity to increase our market share in the highly competitive consumer electronics area 
in addition  we continue to focus on methods to reduce the costs of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expense 
furthermore  we believe that  by focusing on opportunities such as innovative products  new markets  licensing opportunities and creative distribution channels  we can ultimately generate increased financial returns for our shareholders over the long term

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our conclusions 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of our most significant accounting policies  but the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are as follows revenue recognition our revenue is derived principally from the sale of private label and third party branded products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless handsets and satellite systems  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
in most cases  the third party service provider will pay us a fee or commission for obtaining a new customer  as well as a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
fee or commission revenue  net of estimated service disconnects  is generally recognized at the time the customer is accepted as a subscriber of a third party service provider 
residual income is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the service provider  which is typically as the service provider bills its customer  generally on a monthly basis 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if actual returns  sales  fee or commission revenue adjustments exceed or are different from our estimates or assumptions 
additionally  we offer repair service ie  non warranty contracts on products sold 
these contracts generally provide extended service coverage for periods ranging from to months 
we offer these contracts in all but three states on behalf of an unrelated third party obligor 
we are not considered the primary obligor on these contracts 
in these circumstances  our share of commission revenue is recognized as income at the time the contract is sold 
for the contracts offered in the three states where we are the primary obligor  revenues from the sale of these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
costs directly related to the sale of such contracts are deferred and charged to cost of products sold proportionately as the revenues are recognized 
a loss is recognized on extended service contracts if the sum of the expected costs of providing services pursuant to the contracts exceeds the related unearned revenue 
receivables we record receivables based on the amount of revenue recognized as described above 
our receivables primarily consist of amounts due from certain vendors  third party service providers  dealer franchisees and commercial customers 
the carrying amount of the receivables is continually evaluated based on the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is established for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our vendors  third party service providers  and both dealer franchise and commercial customers to make their required payments 
factors such as these parties creditworthiness  payment terms  historical results and economic conditions are considered when making these decisions 
if any of these parties creditworthiness deteriorates beyond our expectations  or if any of their actual defaults exceed our historical experience  such that actual collections are different from their recorded amounts  material charges to our selling  general and administrative expenses could be required 
inventory inventory is our largest asset class 
our inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is recorded at the lower of cost based on the average cost method or market 
we make estimates regarding the carrying value of our inventory on an item by item basis 
if the amount we expect to receive from the sale of the inventory is less than its cost  we write down the cost of the inventory to its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if unexpected changes in technology affect demand for certain products  we could be exposed to losses on the recorded amounts in inventory in excess of our established reserves 
accrued expenses the amount of liability we record for claims related to self insurance  warranty and pending litigation requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use our past history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability that we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in many jurisdictions  including the us  states and localities  and abroad 
we must first determine which revenues and expenses should be included in each taxing jurisdiction 
this process involves the estimation of our actual current tax exposure  together with the assessment of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of income or expense items for tax and accounting purposes 
we establish tax reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimation of current tax exposures 
if we prevail in tax matters for which reserves have been established or we are required to settle matters in excess of established reserves  our effective tax rate for a particular period could be materially affected 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on our balance sheet 
if our actual results differ from estimated results or if we adjust our estimates in the future such that we would not expect to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  we may need to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which could also materially affect our effective tax rate 
overview of financial performance management reviews a number of key indicators to evaluate our financial performance  including o net sales and operating revenues  o gross margin  o selling  general and administrative sg a expense  and o operating margin

net sales and operating revenues year ended december  wireless communication    wired communication radio communication home entertainment  computer power and technical personal electronics  toys and personal audio retail support operations  service plans  and other net sales and operating revenues    compared with net sales and operating revenues sales increased approximately to  million in from  million in we had a increase in comparable company store sales 
these increases were primarily the result of a increase in wireless department sales  partially offset by a decline in sales within the home entertainment department 
these sales increases were possible because of an increase in average store volume  despite a decrease in of company stores  net of store openings 
we expect a sales gain for as discussed in further detail below 
sales to our dealer franchise outlets  in addition to retail support operations and other sales  were down million for  or a decrease of  when compared to sales to our dealer franchise outlets remain substantially less than of our total sales 
retail support operation sales are generated primarily from outside sales of our repair centers  radioshack installation services rsis  and domestic and overseas manufacturing 
the decrease in retail support operations sales from to primarily resulted from an overall decline in our rsis commercial business  the closure of several of our manufacturing facilities in the third quarter of  and the sale of rsis in september we expect sales from dealer franchise and retail support operations to underperform  compared to the sales performance of the company as a whole 
sales in the wireless communication department  which is made up of wireless handsets including related services  accessories  and wireless services such as prepaid airtime and bill payments  increased in dollars and increased as a percentage of total sales to in compared to in this sales increase was due primarily to an increase in the average selling price of our wireless handsets  resulting from our continued emphasis on national carrier service and product offerings with desirable product features and content  such as color screens and cameras 
in addition  sales increases in both wireless services and accessories contributed to this increase 
we believe our plans featuring new technologies  sales promotions  and carrier compensation models will result in wireless sales increases for sales in the wired communication department  which includes residential telephones  answering machines and other related telephony products  decreased in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total sales to in  compared to in these decreases were primarily the result of a decline in sales of the telezapper  a call screening product  although they were partially offset by sales increases of cordless phones 
we anticipate that sales in this department will be down for  compared to  as customers continue to migrate to more advanced technologies 
sales in the radio communication department decreased in dollars and decreased slightly as a percentage of total sales to in  compared to in the decrease in this department was primarily the result of a decrease in family radio service frs  two way radio sales  scanner sales and communication accessories  partially offset by a sales increase in gps devices 
we believe sales in this department will be approximately the same for  compared to sales in the home entertainment department  which consists of all home audio and video end products and accessories  including dth hardware and installation  decreased in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total sales to in compared to in these decreases were primarily attributable to a decline in sales of satellite dishes and their related installation services  as well as a decrease in home entertainment accessory sales 
the sales decrease was partially offset by increased sales of dvd players and televisions 
we anticipate that sales in the home entertainment department will be down for  compared to sales in the computer department  which includes desktop  laptop  handheld computers and related accessories  in addition to digital cameras and home networking products  decreased slightly in dollars and decreased as a percentage of total sales to in compared to in these decreases were primarily the result of a planned decrease in sales of desktop cpus and monitors  substantially offset by increased sales of digital cameras  camcorders and related accessories  as well as home networking products and computer accessories 
we expect that sales in the computer department will increase in  compared to sales in the power and technical department increased slightly in dollars and remained at of total sales for both and this sales increase was primarily due to increased sales of general and special purpose batteries and power inverters  but was partially offset by decreased sales of bulk and packaged wire  as well as decreases for technical parts and tools 
we anticipate that sales will increase in this department in  compared to sales in the personal electronics  toys and personal audio department increased slightly in dollars and remained at of total sales for both and the increase in this department was due primarily to micro radio controlled cars and related accessories not available in the first nine months of and  to a lesser extent  sales of wellness products sold under our lifewise tm brand 
also  increased sales of personal audio products had a positive impact for  resulting from increases in national security threats and the conflict in iraq 
these increases were substantially offset by decreased sales of personal electronics  excluding wellness products  and educational toys 
we believe sales in this department will be approximately the same for  compared to gross profit gross profit for was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in  resulting in a increase in gross profit and a basis point increase in our gross profit percentage 
these increases over the prior year were primarily due to the following we experienced over million in benefit from our supply chain vendor and strategic pricing initiatives 
in connection with these initiatives  we utilized on line reverse auctions  realized more favorable terms from vendors  improved the impact of markdowns  priced our products more appropriately  and utilized other techniques and incentives to optimize gross profit 
we also improved our merchandise mix within departments by increasing the sales mix for many of our higher margin products  while managing the mix down for many lower margin products 
we anticipate that gross profit as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues will continue to improve for  when compared to  due primarily to the planned enhancement of our current sales mix towards higher margin products such as computer accessories  batteries  wellness and digital products 
also  the impact of additional supply chain management initiatives  particularly in vendor relations and end of life inventory management  should provide a positive impact 
selling  general and administrative expense the table below summarizes the breakdown of various components of our consolidated sg a expense and its related percentage of total net sales and operating revenues 
year ended december  of of of sales sales sales in millions dollars revenues dollars revenues dollars revenues payroll and commissions advertising rent other taxes insurance utilities and telephone credit card fees lawsuit settlement stock purchase and savings plans repairs and maintenance printing  postage and office supplies travel loss on real estate sub lease bad debt store closing costs other our sg a expense increased in dollars  but decreased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the dollar increase for was primarily due to a million increase in payroll and commissions and a million increase in advertising  partially offset by the million litigation charge in related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit in california 
payroll expense increased by million to million in and increased percentage points to percent of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to in the increase in both dollars and as a percentage of total sales was due primarily to an increase in incentive pay based on increased earnings  as well as the increase in company retail sales 
we expect payroll expense to increase in advertising expense increased million in to million from million in and increased percentage points to of net sales and operating revenues in  compared to in rent expense increased by million to million in  but remained the same as a percent of net sales and operating revenues of in both and the dollar increase was due primarily to lease renewals and relocations at higher rates  as well as a slight increase in the average store size 
the percent of net sales remained the same due to fewer company stores and our continued rent reduction efforts 
we expect a similar increase in rent for the same reasons described for insurance expense increased million to million in from million in and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in  compared to in substantially all of our insurance expense relates to our self insurance programs 
we maintain reserves for self insurance liabilities related to our group medical and casualty losses  which include general and product liability and workers compensation 
in some cases  risks are insured through outside carriers for losses in excess of self insured amounts 
these reserves are adjusted to reflect estimates based on historical experience  estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  the impact of risk management programs  and the estimated effect of external factors 
as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our expectations 
in  we expect sg a expense to increase slightly in dollars  but decrease slightly as a percentage of net sales and operating revenues  due to increased sales volume and a continued focus on leveraging our fixed expense base 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million dollars to million and remained at of net sales and operating revenues for both and we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase slightly in  due to depreciation increases associated with new store fixtures  capitalized software related to inventory management  and information systems projects 
gain on contract termination there was no gain on contract termination in for information on the prior year gain on contract termination  see the discussion below under the section titled compared with impairment of long lived assets there was no impairment of long lived assets in for information on the prior year impairment of long lived assets  see the discussion below under the section titled compared with net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for  a decrease of million or 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in the average debt outstanding throughout in addition  our interest rate swap instruments and the capitalization of million of interest expense related to the construction of our new corporate campus also lowered overall interest expense for the year ended december   when compared to the same prior year period 
interest income increased over to million in from million in  primarily as a result of a million increase in interest received from tax settlements in  as compared to interest income  including accretion of discount as applicable  earned on the amounts outstanding during the three years ended december   and  was as follows year ended december  in millions compusa note receivable other includes short term investment interest total interest income interest expense  net of interest income  is expected to decrease in  when compared to other income  net on july   we received payment of million resulting from the favorable settlement of a lawsuit we had previously filed 
we recorded this settlement in the third quarter of as other income of million  net of legal expenses of million paid as a result of the lawsuit 
on september   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  amerilink corp 
amerilink  also referred to as rsis  to installs inc  llc in a cash for stock sale  resulting in a loss of million  based on amerilink s book value  which was recorded in other income 
for the year ended december   we received and recorded income of million owed to us under a tax sharing agreement with o sullivan industries holdings  inc o sullivan  compared to million received and recorded in the corresponding prior year period 
in the second quarter of  we received and recorded income of million in partial settlement of amounts owed to us under this tax sharing agreement that was the subject of an arbitration dispute with o sullivan 
this partial settlement followed a ruling in our favor by the arbitration panel 
future payments under the tax sharing agreement will vary based on the level of o sullivan s future earnings and are also dependent on o sullivan s overall financial condition and ability to pay 
there can be no assurances that future payments will be received under the tax sharing agreement each quarter  nor can we give any assurances as to the amount of payment that may be received each quarter 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate for  when compared to  was the result of a favorable tax settlement related to prior year tax matters 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate for will be approximately 
compared with net sales and operating revenues sales decreased approximately to  million in from  million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decline in sales to our dealer franchise outlets in  mainly due to the decline in dth unit sales 
in addition  we also had a decrease in comparable company store sales due primarily to the decline of dth unit sales and desktop computers  but offset by sales increases in wireless handsets and related accessories 
retail support operations  service plans and other sales decreased from to primarily as a result of a million decrease in domestic manufacturing sales due to large verizon fixture sales in and a million decrease in rsis sales as a result of our exit from the national commercial installation business at the end of sales in the wireless communication department increased in dollars and increased to of our total sales in from in this sales increase was due to an increase in sales of wireless handsets and accessories which resulted from our emphasis on national carrier offerings with desirable product features and content  such as color screens  photo capability and internet access

sales in the home entertainment department decreased in dollars and decreased as a percentage of our total sales to in from in substantially all of the dollar decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales of satellite dishes and related installations 
this decrease was partially offset by increased sales of dvd players

sales in the power and technical department increased in dollars and also as a percentage of our total sales to in from in these increases were primarily due to increased sales of general and special purpose batteries  partially offset by decreased sales of bulk and packaged wire and technical parts 
sales in the personal electronics  toys and personal audio department increased in dollars  as well as increasing as a percentage of our total sales to in from in  due primarily to increased sales of micro radio controlled cars and related accessories  in addition to unique giftables 
gross profit gross profit in was  million or of net sales and operating revenues  compared with  million or of net sales and operating revenues in gross profit decreased million or in  primarily as a result of a decrease in net sales and operating revenues 
despite this decrease in gross profit dollars  the gross profit percentage increased from to in  due primarily to an increase in the gross profit percentage in the home entertainment department and  to a lesser extent  increases in both the power and technical and computer departments gross profit percentages 
our gross profit percentage increase was partially offset by reductions in both the wireless and wired departments gross profit percentages  compounded by the increase in the wireless communication department s percent of total retail sales 
the reduction in gross profit dollars was partially offset by a decrease in the total sales mix attributable to the home entertainment department  which has a lower gross profit percentage than our overall average gross profit percentage  as well as an increase in gross profit dollars for the power and technical department 
additionally  the gross profit percentage improved for our retail support operations in selling  general and administrative expense our sg a expense increased in dollars and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the dollar increase for was primarily due to a million litigation charge related to the settlement of a class action lawsuit in california and a million charge to our restructuring reserve as a result of the bankruptcy of a sub lessee in a former incredible universe store site 
a million increase in our rent expense and lower overall sales in also contributed to a higher sg a expense ratio 
this was partially offset by a million charge for store closing costs from  which did not reoccur in payroll expense decreased by million to million in  but increased slightly as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in  compared to in the decrease in dollars was due primarily to our reduction in headcount during the third quarter of rent expense increased by million to million in and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in from in these increases were due primarily to lease renewals and relocations at higher rates  as well as a slight increase in the average store size 
advertising expense decreased million in to million from million in  while remaining at of net sales and operating revenues during both and the dollar decrease was due primarily to an increase in advertising contributions from our various vendors and third party service providers 
insurance expense increased million to million in from million in and increased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in  compared to in as of december   actual losses regarding insurance claims had not exceeded our expectations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million dollars to million and decreased as a percent of net sales and operating revenues to in from in these decreases were primarily attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization related to rsis  as well as the sale of our corporate headquarters  during the fourth quarter of gain on contract termination radioshack and microsoft mutually agreed during to terminate their agreement and settle the remaining commitments each had to one another 
the termination of this agreement took effect at the start of the fourth quarter of  upon satisfaction of several contractual obligations 
the net financial result was an million gain principally cash received  driven primarily by the settlement of a multi year obligation microsoft had to connect our stores with broadband capabilities 
impairment of long lived assets amerilink was acquired in to provide us with residential installation capabilities for the technologies and services offered in our retail stores 
as a result of continued difficulties in the dth business and a refocus during the fourth quarter on our satellite installation strategy  together with a revised cash flow projection for our overall installation business  we determined that the remaining long lived assets associated with rsis were impaired 
we compared the carrying value of these long lived assets with their fair value and determined that the remaining goodwill balance of million was impaired and we  therefore  recorded an impairment charge of this amount in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
as of december   there was no remaining goodwill balance on our balance sheet relating to rsis 
loss on sale of assets in the fourth quarter of  we sold and leased back most of our corporate headquarters at a loss of million 
in june  we received million for the settlement of the computer city  inc purchase price and settlement of the million note which was received in connection with the sale of computer city  inc in thus  we incurred an additional loss from the sale of computer city  inc of million 
employee separation and other costs during the third quarter of  as part of our effort to control operating costs  we incurred approximately million in charges related to a reduction of our labor force  primarily for early retirements and involuntary and voluntary employee severance 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  million in charges were incurred relating to the closure of rsis s national commercial installation business 
these costs were primarily comprised of severance costs  write offs of certain fixed assets and future lease commitments 
net interest expense interest expense  net of interest income  was million for versus million for interest expense decreased to million in from million in  primarily as a result of a reduction in the average debt outstanding throughout in addition  our interest rate swap instruments also lowered overall interest expense for the year ended december   when compared to the same prior year period 
interest income decreased almost to million in from million in  due primarily to compusa s early payment of its note to us in june  which eliminated the associated interest income 
other income  net in the second quarter of  we received payments and recorded income of million in partial settlement of amounts owed to us under a tax sharing agreement that was the subject of an arbitration which commenced in july and was styled tandy corporation and te electronics  te vs 
o sullivan 
the arbitration ruling requires o sullivan to comply with the tax sharing agreement that was entered into by the parties at the time of o sullivan s initial public offering 
during the second half of  we received two payments totaling million relating to quarterly payments under the tax sharing agreement with o sullivan 
provision for loss on internet related investment during the second quarter of  we made a million investment in digital convergence corporation dc  a privately held internet technology company 
in the first quarter of  we concluded that our investment had experienced a decline in value that  in our opinion  was other than temporary 
this conclusion was based on dc s inability to secure sufficient additional funding or to complete an initial public offering 
as such  we recorded a loss provision equal to our initial investment 
dc subsequently filed for bankruptcy on march  provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective income tax rate of for and for the decrease in the effective tax rate in when compared to was the result of the impairment of rsis goodwill  which was not deductible for tax purposes and caused the increased effective tax rate in recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

cash flow and liquidity a summary of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities is outlined in the table below 
year ended december  in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities in  cash flows provided by operating activities was million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
during the year ended december   changes in accounts receivable  consisting primarily of amounts due from our various vendors and third party service providers  provided million in cash  compared to million in the prior year 
cash provided by accounts receivable in and was the result of reductions of vendor and service provider receivables and dealer franchise receivables  due to increased collections and lower sales of satellite television hardware 
during the year ended december   changes in inventory provided million in cash  compared to a million cash usage during the decrease in inventory since december   was primarily the result of supply chain initiatives  including a greater focus on reducing weeks of supply 
typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory build up range between million and million 
the funding required for this build up comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   as a resource for our funding needs 
additional capital is available under our million dollar commercial paper program  which is supported by a bank credit facility that could be utilized in the event the commercial paper market is unavailable to us 
we currently do not expect  however  the commercial paper market to become unavailable to us or that we will have to utilize the credit facility 
as of december   we had no commercial paper outstanding or other utilization of our credit facility 
during the year ended december   million less in cash was provided by accounts payable due to lower inventory levels than in the prior year 
additionally  million more in cash was provided by accrued expenses and million more in cash was provided by reduced income taxes payable  compared to the prior year 
cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million and million used in and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million in  compared to million in and million in capital expenditures for increased over the prior two years  primarily due to the construction of our new corporate campus  while capital expenditures for both and were primarily for our retail store expansions and remodels and upgrades of information systems 
we also had capital expenditures relating to retail stores and information systems in in addition  we purchased land costing million in for our new corporate headquarters building 
we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for will be approximately million 
the million increase over primarily relates to our new corporate headquarters 
store remodels and relocations and updated information systems account for the almost half of the balance of our anticipated capital expenditures 
see further discussion of our new facilities below in the section titled capital structure and financial condition 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
these cash and cash equivalents  along with cash generated from our net sales and operating revenues and  if necessary  both our short term and long term financing facilities  are available to fund future capital expenditure needs 
cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
we used million for the repurchase of our common stock in and million and million for the repurchase of our common and preferred stock in and  respectively 
repurchases of common stock were made under our share repurchase and employee stock programs 
see the further discussion of our stock repurchase programs below in the section titled capital structure and financial condition 
the  and stock repurchases were partially funded by million  million and million  respectively  received from the sale of treasury stock to employee benefit plans and  to a lesser extent  from stock option exercises 
the balance of capital to repurchase shares was obtained from cash generated from operations 
we received million from the sale and lease back of our corporate technology center building during the second quarter of this transaction was recorded as a financing obligation due to responsibilities which we retain during the lease period 
dividends paid  net of tax  in  and amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
our free cash flow  defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property  plant and equipment  was million in  compared to million in this increase in free cash flow  when compared to the prior year  was the result of supply chain initiatives  including a greater focus on reducing inventory weeks of supply 
the increase was partially offset by the increase in capital expenditures related to our new corporate campus 
we expect free cash flow to be approximately million in the decrease from is based primarily on the timing of capital expenditures for our new corporate headquarters  the majority of which we originally thought would have been included in our capital expenditures 
the major portion of our new corporate campus expenditures will now be part of our capital expenditures 
after  we anticipate a return to a more historical free cash flow level of million to million  annually 
we believe free cash flow is an appropriate indication of our ability to fund share repurchases  repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities  which were million in  compared to million in we do not intend the presentation of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 
year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment dividends paid free cash flow capital structure and financial condition management considers our financial structure and condition solid 
at december   total capitalization was  million  consisting of million of debt and million of equity  which resulted in a debt to total capitalization ratio of  compared to for the corresponding prior year period 
the ratio decreased from the prior year due to a smaller increase in debt of million  compared to a larger increase in equity of million from long term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was at december   compared to at december   and at december  the decrease in was due to the decrease in long term debt  as some of the notes moved to the short term debt classification as current maturities 
our debt is considered investment grade by the rating agencies 
on may   fitch changed our senior unsecured debt from a to bbb 
below are the agencies latest ratings by category 
standard category moody s and poor s fitch senior unsecured debt baa a bbb commercial paper p a f our senior unsecured debt primarily consists of two issuances of year long term notes and an issuance of medium term notes 
we have a million debt shelf registration statement which became effective in august as of december   there was no availability for further debt issuances under this shelf registration 
in august  we issued million of year unsecured long term notes under this shelf registration 
the interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on september and march of each year  commencing march  these notes are due september  we also issued  in various amounts and on various dates from december through september  medium term notes totaling million under the shelf registration 
at december   million of these notes remained outstanding 
the interest rates at december   for the outstanding million medium term notes ranged from to and had a weighted average coupon rate of 
these notes have maturities ranging from to on may   we issued million of year notes in a private offering to initial purchasers who offered the notes to qualified institutional buyers under sec rule a 
the annual interest rate on the notes is per annum with interest payable on november and may of each year 
payment of interest on the notes commenced on november   and the notes mature on may  in august  under the terms of an exchange offering filed with the sec  we exchanged substantially all of these notes for a similar amount of publicly registered notes 
because no additional debt was issued in the exchange offering  the net effect of this exchange was that no additional debt was issued on august   and substantially all of the notes are now registered with the sec 
during the third quarter of  we entered into several interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million and maturities ranging from to in june and august  we entered into additional interest rate swap agreements with underlying notional amounts of debt of million and million  respectively  with maturities in may we entered into these agreements to effectively convert a portion of our long term fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
under these agreements  we have contracted to pay a variable rate of libor plus a markup and to receive fixed rates ranging from to 
we have designated these agreements as fair value hedging instruments 
at december   we recorded an amount in other assets  net  of million its fair value for the swap agreements and adjusted the fair value of the related debt by the same amount 
the effect of these agreements was a reduction in our interest expense of million during  when compared to the fixed rates 
at current interest rates  we expect this favorable condition to reoccur in we have short term debt such as commercial paper issuances and uncommitted bank loans available to supplement our short term financing needs 
the commercial paper and short term seasonal bank debt have a typical maturity of days or less 
the amount of commercial paper that can be outstanding is limited to a maximum of the unused portion of our million bank syndicated revolving credit facility described in more detail below 
in the second quarter of  we replaced our existing million day revolving credit facility and amended our million five year credit facility 
these facilities maturity dates are june for the million day revolving credit facility and june for the million five year revolving credit facility 
the terms of these revolving credit facilities are substantially similar to the previous facilities 
these revolving credit facilities will support any future commercial paper borrowings and are otherwise available for our general corporate purposes 
we anticipate replacing our day revolving credit facility in june with a new day credit facility with similar terms 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities 
our outstanding debt and bank syndicated credit facilities have customary financial covenants 
we use operating leases  primarily for our retail locations  distribution centers and corporate headquarters  to lower our capital requirements 
management believes that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit lines and long term debt in place 
however  if market conditions change and sales were to dramatically decline or we could not control operating costs  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
additionally  if a scenario as described above occurred  it could cause the rating agencies to lower our credit ratings  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and or equity markets 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million during the year ended december   under our combined share repurchase programs 
we intend to execute share repurchases from time to time in order to take advantage of attractive share price levels  as determined by management 
the timing and terms of the transactions depend on market conditions  our liquidity and other considerations 
on february   our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program for million shares  which was in addition to our million share repurchase program that was completed during the second quarter of at february   there were million shares available to be repurchased under the million share repurchase program 
we anticipate that we will repurchase  under our authorized repurchase programs  between million and million of our common stock during the million share repurchase program has no expiration date and allows shares to be repurchased in the open market 
the funding required for these share repurchase programs will come from cash generated from net sales and operating revenues and cash and cash equivalents 
under the programs described above  we will also repurchase shares in the open market to offset the sales of shares to our employee benefit plans 
on december   our board of directors approved the retirement of million shares of our common stock held as treasury stock 
these shares returned to the status of authorized and unissued 
see our consolidated statement of stockholders equity for additional details of this transaction 
on october   our board of directors approved the conversion of our radioshack series b convertible preferred stock  held by the radioshack k plan  to radioshack common stock effective december  on december   million shares of this preferred stock  representing all the outstanding series b convertible preferred stock  were converted to million shares of our common stock in accordance with their terms 
the preferred stock was held by the radioshack k plan to fund radioshack contributions to plan participants 
in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  we sold our corporate headquarters buildings 
we are now constructing a new headquarters in fort worth  texas 
we entered into sale leaseback agreements in which our existing corporate headquarters land and buildings were sold and leased back to us 
these arrangements should provide us with the necessary time to construct our new headquarters  which we expect to be completed by the end of or early currently  we plan to finance our new corporate headquarters  with total construction costs estimated to be million during and  with cash flows from operations and  if needed  existing cash and cash equivalents 
the following tables  as well as the information contained in note indebtedness and borrowing facilities to our notes to consolidated financial statements  provide a summary of our various contractual commitments  debt and interest repayment requirements  and available credit lines 
the table below contains the contractual commitments associated with our financing obligations  lease obligations  and marketing agreements 
purchase obligations include our product commitments  marketing agreements  utility and freight commitments 
in millions payments due by period total amounts less than contractual obligations committed year years years over years long term debt obligations capitalized lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet the table below contains our credit commitments from various financial institutions 
in millions commitment expiration per period total amounts less than credit commitments committed year years years over years lines of credit stand by letters of credit total commercial commitments we have contingent liabilities related to retail leases of locations which were assigned to other businesses 
the majority of these contingent liabilities relate to various lease obligations arising from leases that were assigned to compusa  inc as part of the sale of our computer city  inc 
subsidiary to compusa  inc in august in the event compusa or the other assignees  as applicable  are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
our rent exposure from the remaining undiscounted lease commitments with no projected sublease income is approximately million 
however  we have no reason to believe that compusa or the other assignees will not fulfill their obligations under these leases  consequently  we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial statements from any fulfillment of these commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation inflation has not significantly impacted us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our operations in the foreseeable future  unless international events substantially affect the global economy 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
at december   we did not have any derivative instruments that materially increase our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks  other than the interest rate swaps noted in md a 
we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our net investment of million  comprised of fluctuating short term investments of million and offset by million of indebtedness which  because of the interest rate swaps discussed in md a  effectively bears interest at short term floating rates 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in the interest rate applicable to this floating rate net exposure would result in a decrease in annual net interest expense of million 
this assumption assumes no change in the net principal balance 
we also manage our portfolio of fixed rate debt to reduce our exposure to interest rate changes 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is sensitive to interest rate changes 
interest rate changes would result in increases or decreases in the fair value of our debt due to differences between market interest rates and rates at the inception of the debt obligation 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would decrease million and million  respectively 
based on a hypothetical immediate basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and  the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt would increase by million and million  respectively 
regarding the fair value of our fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates have no impact on our consolidated financial statements
