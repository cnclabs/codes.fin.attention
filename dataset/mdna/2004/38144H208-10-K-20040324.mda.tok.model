item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this k 
overview we are a leading provider of solutions that enable community banks to manage accounts receivable financing provided to their small business customers 
our solution is called business manager  and is based on software  marketing  and online electronic transaction processing services 
one element of business manager is our proprietary software  which enables our network of client banks to purchase accounts receivable from their small business customers 
the banks then process  bill and track those receivables on an ongoing basis 
as a major component of our program  we work with client banks to design  implement and manage the sale of business manager accounts receivable financing services to their small business customers 
we also give our client banks the option of outsourcing to us their application hosting and transaction processing through secure internet connections  allowing them to receive accounts receivable information and make funding decisions electronically 
on january   we completed a capital restructuring event consisting of the sale of  shares of our series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at a price of per share to lightyear fund  lp for a total purchase price of million  as well as the execution of a new long term credit facility with a bank that allows for total borrowings of up to million 
this process was initiated in april as a result of the ninth amendment to our credit facility  which required that a capital event  as defined in the amendment  be pursued and completed by december  as a result  this process consumed a great deal of executive management resources during  which hindered some of the core business initiatives outlined early in the completion of this capital event is a significant milestone in our company s history as it improves our capitalization and financial position  which we believe will allow the company to begin a new growth phase 
in previous filings  we have commented that part of our growth strategy is to acquire or develop new products and services 
while this will continue to be one aspect of our strategy  our primary focus in will be to return our core receivables financing business to a growth business 
we strongly believe that the market for our core business is strong  particularly given the pervasive signs that an economic recovery is underway 
the receivables financing market is strongly influenced by the united states economy  and as we have seen during the past two years of economic decline  it has impacted our core business revenues negatively 
we believe that with an improving and growing economy and initiatives underway  that we can return our core receivables financing business to a growth mode 
in order to achieve this goal  we have undertaken several key initiatives 
first  we intend to invest in our sales force by expanding our bank sales personnel  as well as our business development managers 
during the last three years  our average number of sales personnel has declined each year 
now that we have addressed the financial uncertainty related to our high debt service obligations  which constrained our ability to invest in the sales force in prior years  we believe that increasing the size of our sales force is a top priority 
second  we intend to train our entire sales force more effectively in order to achieve higher productivity levels from all of our sales personnel 
we have redesigned our sales training agenda for new sales personnel so that they receive more comprehensive training on the products they are expected to sell 
further  we have begun a process of re training all of our existing sales personnel during february and march of this training is a four day session that covers all aspects of the company s products  operations  and technologies 
finally  the third key initiative is creating sales force accountability 
beginning in late  all of sales management was given minimum acceptable quotas for new bank and merchant sales for the core business as well as for the various new products launched in these quotas have been disseminated and communicated to all sales personnel  and individual sales personnel performance will be measured against these quotas continually 
we believe that successful execution of the sales force initiatives will result in growth of the core business  however we do not expect to see significant improvement in revenues or operating results in these initiatives will take a considerable amount of time and the fruits of these initiatives will not begin to be seen in our financial results until late critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following accounting policies fit this definition 
table of contents revenue recognition 
we generate revenue from four main sources participation fees earned on client bank purchases of small business accounts receivable 
software license fees from new client banks 
retail planning services 
maintenance fees and other revenues  comprised primarily of fees received for insurance brokerage services  paper based form sales  software maintenance  medical  and processing services 
there are two types of participation fees 
the first type is earned upon the client bank s initial purchase of a small business accounts receivable during the first days in our program 
the second type is an ongoing participation fee earned from subsequent period purchases 
both types of fees are based on a percentage of the receivables that a client bank purchases from its small business customers during each month 
the second type of fee is a smaller percentage of the ongoing receivables purchased 
participation fees are recognized as earned  which is based upon the transaction dates of bank purchases from its small business customers 
software license fees for business manager consist of two components the license fee and customer training and support fee 
these are one time fees that we receive upon the initial licensing of our business manager program to a community bank 
our license agreements are executed with terms ranging from three to five years  and are renewable for subsequent terms 
some agreements contain performance or deferred payment terms that must be met in order for us to receive payment and recognize revenue 
we recognize revenues from the license fee once we have met the terms of the customer agreement 
the customer training and support fee are recognized ratably over the twelve month service period subsequent to the activation of the license agreement 
revenue recognition rules for up front fees are complex and do require some interpretation and judgment on the part of management 
management has consistently followed the same revenue recognition practices for this type of revenue during all years presented 
we believe that this practice most accurately portrays the economic reality of the transactions 
retail planning services revenue is generated from fees charged primarily for providing inventory merchandising and forecasting information for specialty retail stores and ancillary services related to these products 
rmsa uses proprietary software to process sales and inventory transactions and provide the merchandising forecasting information 
we recognize revenues as the transactions occur and merchandising and forecasting services are performed 
maintenance fees and other revenues include several ancillary products and services we provide to client banks 
annual software maintenance fees are generated from our client banks starting on the first anniversary date of the business manager license agreement and annually thereafter 
these revenues are recognized ratably over a twelve month period beginning on the first anniversary date of the agreement 
additionally  since  we have brokered  through our private business insurance subsidiary  credit and fraud insurance products from a national insurance company 
we earn fees based on a percentage of the premium that is paid to the insurance company 
these commission revenues are recognized at the time receivable fundings covered by credit and fraud insurance policies are purchased by our bank customers 
we also provide a standard set of forms that client banks may purchase and use in the normal course of administering the business manager program 
revenues related to these forms are recognized in the period that they are shipped to the client bank 
we also have some industry focused applications for the medical and dental markets 
monthly transaction processing fees include charges for electronic processing  statement rendering and mailing  settling payments  recording account changes and new accounts  leasing and selling point of sale terminals  telephone and software support services  rental fees and collecting debts 
software development costs 
software development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products to be sold or marketed are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after such time  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
also  the company capitalizes the cost of internally used software when application development begins in accordance with aicpa sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this is generally defined as the point when research and development has been completed  the project feasibility established  and management has approved a development plan 
many of the costs capitalized for internally used software are related to upgrades or enhancements of existing systems 
these costs are only capitalized if the development costs will result in specific additional functionality of the existing system  and are capitalized at the point that application development begins 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  generally three years 
the key assumptions and estimates that must be made relative to this accounting policy center around determining when technological feasibility has been achieved and whether the project being undertaken is one that will be marketable or enhance the marketability of an existing product for externally marketed software and whether the project will result in additional functionality for internal use software projects 
management consults monthly with all 
table of contents project managers to ensure that the scope and expected results of each project are understood in order to make a judgment on whether it meets the requirements outlined in the authoritative accounting literature 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of the identified consolidated statement of operations items to total revenues

participation fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to two reasons a decrease in the average participation rate and a decrease in the total funding through our business manager program 
the average participation rate declined to 
in as compared to 
in the decreased average participation rate was due to two factors 
first  our bank customers  in response to continued declines in interest rates  were forced to lower their service charge  which has a direct effect on our participation rates

the decline is the result of fewer bank salesman on staff during as compared to  as well as potential bank customers being unwilling to enter into a long term contracts due to the company s financial uncertainty that existed throughout retail planning services 
retail planning services revenue decreased to million as compared to million in the decline of million  or  from is a result of a decline in forecast plans produced in as compared to  in compared to  in 
also contributing to the decline was fewer point of sale system support customers  which is due to the point of sale system support services offered relate to a point of sales system that is no longer being marketed  upgraded and sold

the company was the borrower under a credit agreement dated august  between the company as borrower  and fleet national bank as administrative agent for a syndicate of other lenders the fleet credit facility 
the fleet credit facility was secured by a pledge of all of our assets and contained financial and non financial covenants and contained negative covenants  which  among other things  limited our ability to sell material assets  redeem capital stock and pay cash dividends 
the company was in violation of certain covenants as of december  the fleet credit facility was paid in full on january  using the net proceeds received from the lightyear transaction and the net proceeds from the bank of america credit facility 
as such  
table of contents the fleet covenants expired at the time of refinancing 
the company was and expects to be in compliance with the new bank of america credit facility covenants throughout the fleet credit facility included term loans with balances of million the term a loan and million the term b loan  and our revolving line of credit availability in the amount of the lesser of million or of the eligible receivables as defined in the fleet credit facility

interest is also due on the revolving loan quarterly at the applicable margin 
the interest rates of the term loan and revolving loan are based on a pricing grid using the company s funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda ratio  as follows funded debt to ebitda libor base rate less than or equal to libor greater than but less than or equal to libor greater than but less than or equal to libor as of february   the rate  calculated as libor  was the credit agreement includes certain restrictive financial covenants  measured quarterly  relating to net worth  maximum annual capital expenditures  funded debt to ebitda ratio and fixed charges coverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement

as of december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million compared to a working capital deficit of approximately million as of december  the change in working capital resulted primarily from a decrease in the amount of the current portion of long term debt by million  as well as a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and an increase in cash of  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily the result of improved collections and lower days sales outstanding  as well as  lower revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are primarily attributable to lower overall operating expenses and continued payments of assumed liabilities from the towne merger 
as mentioned above  subsequent to year end  the company completed a capital event consisting of the sale of preferred stock and a new credit facility 
these events result in a significant improvement in the company s financial position 
immediately following these transactions  the company s working capital improved to an estimated  compared to the million working capital deficit as of december  we believe that the existing cash available  future operating cash flows and our new revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
furthermore  we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants of our new credit facility 
table of contents throughout there can be no assurance the company will have sufficient cash flows to meet its obligations or that the company will remain in compliance with the new covenants and non compliance with these covenants could have a material adverse impact to the company s operating and financial results

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requiring that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
 which applies to all entities  is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company s adoption of sfas no 
during fiscal did not materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
at the november  emerging issues task force eitf meeting  the task force reached a consensus in issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets  other than those arrangements accounted for under other more specific literature 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the company s adoption of this new consensus did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
financial instruments that fall within the scope of sfas no 
must be classified by the issuer as liabilities or assets in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the company has reclassified its series b preferred stock to stockholders equity that had been previously shown outside of stockholders equity  based on its terms and characteristics 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  to expand upon and strengthen existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that guidance by requiring a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosure about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after march  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company is currently evaluating the requirements and impact  if any  of fin on its consolidated results of operations and financial position 
seasonality we have generally realized lower revenues and income in the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the second quarter of the year 
we believe that this is primarily due to a general slowdown in economic activity following the fourth quarter s holiday season and  more specifically  a decrease in purchased receivables by our client banks 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparison cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
due to the relatively fixed nature of costs such as personnel  facilities and equipment costs  a revenue decline in a quarter will typically result in lower profitability for that quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
note regarding forward looking information this report contains several forward looking statements concerning our operations  prospects  strategies and financial condition  including our future economic performance  intent  plans and objectives  and the likelihood of success in developing and expanding our business 
these statements are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates  which are subject to significant uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
words such as may  would  could  expect  anticipate  believe  intend  plan  and estimate are meant to identify such forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report on form k  and include  among other factors  liquidity and capital resources  the timely development and market acceptance of products and technologies  and competitive market conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
our exposure relates primarily to our long term debt obligations  which expire in pursuant to the bank of america credit facility 
under the fleet credit facility  our long term debt obligations totaled million as of december  an increase of basis points under the fleet credit facility would have resulted in an impact on future cash flows of approximately  annually 
under the bank of america credit facility  our long term debt obligations totaled million as of february  an increase of basis point under the bank of america credit facility will impact future cash flows by approximately  annually
