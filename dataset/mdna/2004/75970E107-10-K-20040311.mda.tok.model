item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of the financial data discussed above 
prior period information has been restated for reclassification of mortgage loans held for resale from loans 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except share data overview economy on the economic front  began with sales reports showing only modest growth  business outlays remaining soft  corporate governance being heightened  and worries about the potential war with iraq 
oil prices began increasing  adding to the downward pressure on the economic recovery 
however  despite these factors  the economy continued to grow  but at levels slightly below the forecast for the first two quarters 
economists had forecast approximately growth in gdp with a increase in the cpi for coupled with these projections was the consensus forecast that interest rates would rise during the third quarter 
by mid year it became more evident that the economy was not growing fast enough to create the number of jobs needed to lower the unemployment rate 
corporate spending continued to lag  with the justification that the capacity utilization index was approximately 
the unemployment rate had increased from at the beginning of the year to by mid year 
at its june meeting  the federal reserve lowered the interest rate on federal funds to  a decrease of basis points  its lowest level in forty five years 
soon thereafter the prime interest rate decreased from to 
this stimulus gave an added boost to the economy  and the gdp grew at an rate during the third quarter 
while this growth was not sustained during the fourth quarter  we did see the unemployment rate drop back to by year end 
during the major driver of the economy came from consumer spending 
both housing starts and home sales were very strong throughout the year 
auto sales were strong as well  fueled by the low interest rates and the incentives being offered by manufacturers 
business spending for capital equipment  having declined for the prior two years  stabilized and industrial production increased approximately over the local economy in the primary markets of our operating region remained relatively strong in the two markets that make up the largest share of our volume  lee and desoto counties  both had significant industrial and housing growth in approximately of our loan volume and of our deposit volume comes from these two markets 
since mid  our lee county home base has added approximately six hundred manufacturing jobs through expansions of eleven plants and the addition of four new plants 
during  lee county created over one thousand manufacturing jobs  which is in line with the twenty year average of one thousand per year 
unemployment for lee county as of november   was  less than the u 
s 
unemployment rate of 
retail sales for lee county  one of the top five retail markets in mississippi  were up over while the economy of north mississippi is diversified  furniture manufacturing is an important element 
housing starts  permits and new home sales remained high until the fourth quarter of  then fell to normal levels for the fourth quarter 
normally  furniture orders follow the housing market 
desoto county  adjacent to memphis  tennessee  is another of our leading growth markets saw its retail sales up over desoto county attracted eight new companies and recorded twelve industrial expansions  including one by williams sonoma 
this level of development in desoto county is expected to continue 
the unemployment rate for desoto county at december   was  considerably lower than the u 
s 
unemployment rate of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared using accounting estimates for various accounts 
wherever feasible  we utilize third party information to provide management with estimates 
although independent third parties are utilized to assist us in the estimation process  management evaluates the results  and challenges assumptions used and other factors which could impact the estimation 
following are some of the more significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements 

table of contents the critical accounting policy most important to the presentation of our financial statements relates to the allowance for loan loss and related provision 
the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collective impairment as recognized under fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade 
another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the balance of these loans determined as impaired under fasb statement no 
and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments  unemployment rate in our market  loan segmentation  and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management provides additional reserves through the provision for loan losses 
we have a number of documented loan policies and procedures that set forth the approval and monitoring process of the lending function 
adherence to these policies and procedures is mandated by management and the board of directors 
the company has an in house loss management committee in addition to maintaining a loan review staff 
for additional disclosure regarding procedures followed  see our discussion in the credit risk section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
before funds are advanced  loans are scored by the underwriters 
grades are assigned by lending personnel based on the scoring of the loans that are funded 
loan grades range from to  with being loans with the least credit risk 
allowance factors established by management are applied to each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance factors are established based on our loss experience  adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios  as well as regulatory guidelines for criticized loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated collectively for impairment 
for impaired loans  a specific reserve is established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its fair value 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for problem loans of or greater by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the ultimate collectibility of an impaired loan s principal is in doubt  wholly or partially  the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
loan review personnel monitor the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination 
the loss management committee monitors loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor  and adjusts the loan credit grade accordingly 
this information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality 
the allowance for loan losses is established after input from management  loan review  and the loss management committee 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is calculated quarterly  or more frequently if management deems it necessary 
these calculations are reviewed by management and the internal loan review staff 
foreclosure proceedings are initiated after all collection efforts have failed 
the collateral is sold at public auction for fair market value  with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price 
the remaining sales price is applied to the outstanding loan balance 
if the loan balance is greater than the sales proceeds  the deficient balance is sent to the loan committee comprised of the board of directors for charge off approval 
these charge offs reduce the allowance for loan losses 
on a monthly basis  management and the board of directors review loan ratios 
these ratios include the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans  the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans  nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans  and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans 
in addition  management reviews past due ratios by officer  community bank  and company 

table of contents other real estate is included in other assets and consists of properties acquired through a foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
these properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value based on appraised value less estimated selling costs 
losses arising from the acquisition of properties are charged against the allowance for loan losses

the accrual for that plan is based on actual qualified salaries for the k expense was calculated in the same manner 
we believe we employ appropriate methods for these calculations that should closely approximate the actual cost 
we review the calculated results for reasonableness  and compare those calculations to prior period costs 
we also consider the effect of current economic conditions on the calculations 
highlights and performance overview for while was a year of challenges  it presented us with opportunities as well 
our focus to stay on track with our strategic plan took on even more significance 
those challenges  fueled by the low interest rate environment and coupled with flat economic growth  required us to be assertive and innovative in our efforts to improve net income 
while we saw a decline in the net interest margin  both the provision for loan losses and noninterest income improved significantly 
in addition  the growth in noninterest expense moderated 
for specific details on how these factors contributed to the growth in net income  see results of operations

selected data for renasant bancshares at december  is presented below 
assets loans deposits equity net income results of operations net interest income  the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities  is the largest component of our net income  comprising of total revenue 
although we experienced a decline in net interest income during  our net interest margin  which was down from prior year  still remains above our peer group average 
the primary concerns in managing net interest income are the asset liability mix and the repricing of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
during the asset liability management committee was assertive in making pricing decisions that enhanced net interest income 
since the balance sheet was liability sensitive at that time  the falling interest rate environment was conducive to increasing net interest income 
in contrast  during we began repricing a significant portion of our assets at lower rates 
and with the somewhat sluggish economy for most of the year  loan growth on a period to period basis was relatively flat 
as a result of low interest rates  approximately  of in house mortgages sought permanent financing in the secondary market  moving from short term loans with the bank to traditional long term mortgage loans that are sold upon closing 
this shift  combined with the continual decline in our sales finance loan program that was discontinued in  and the increase in the volume of the prepayments of our mortgage backed securities had a significant impact on net interest income 
with the basis points drop in interest rates in june of  we began experiencing a significant acceleration in the volume of prepayments of our mortgage backed securities in the third quarter 
during the fourth quarter  those securities were back to more normal prepayment speeds  reducing the premium amortization 
the increase in rates in the fourth quarter of resulted in much lower mortgage loan volume and normal prepayment volume on mortgage backed securities 
if rates increase in  we would certainly expect the volume of prepayments on mortgage backed securities to remain at current levels 

table of contents while there are a number of options available for improving net interest income  we believe that the best option to improve net interest income is to increase the volume of our loans 
with this in mind  two executives were added to our financial services division which targets the more affluent market for commercial loan  deposit  and other financial services needs 
in addition  we have better positioned ourselves to take advantage of interest rates as interest rates begin to rise 
while we will still reprice more liabilities than assets during the next twelve months  we have decreased that position by increasing the amount of variable rate loans to approximately of the loan portfolio 
the average life of the investment portfolio was approximately two and one half years for both december  and approximately of the company s assets will be repriced during net interest income on a tax equivalent basis decreased  or  from  in to  in of the tax equivalent decrease  an increase of  was due to the favorable growth in the volume of net earning assets and a decrease of  was due to changes in interest rates 
the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased from to  or basis points 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in  or basis points 
during both and  we experienced improvement in net interest income for a number of reasons 
first and foremost was the asset liability management committee s assertiveness in making pricing decisions to enhance net interest income 
further enhancing net interest margin was the effect of changing the mix in our investment portfolio  which began in and continued in in addition  we increased our emphasis on loan growth as a result of recognizing that we must improve our loan to deposit ratio in order to become a high performing bank 
in  we added two seasoned lenders to our team in the desoto county market  located in the memphis msa  and two in the lee county tupelo market 
finally  we experienced a change in our deposit mix as clients moved from longer term time deposits to shorter term interest bearing and money market accounts 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased  or  from  in to  in of the tax equivalent change   of the increase was due to the favorable growth in net earning assets and  of the increase was due to changes in interest rates 
the tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased from to  or basis points 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities dropped from in to in  or basis points 
average earning assets to total average assets average earning assets as a percentage of total average assets are shown above for a five year period 
the improvement shown for  although slight  is due to enhancements made in cash management 
the decrease in was attributable to the purchase of  of bank owned life insurance boli mid year of boli is classified as non earning and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
if the boli had been purchased at the beginning of  the earning asset ratio for would have been approximately 
the improvement for over the adjusted ratio of is attributable in part to cash management as well 
the tax equivalent yields on earning assets were   and  for   and  respectively

table of contents net interest margin  the tax equivalent net yield on earning assets  decreased to during from for the comparable period in the prior year 
the table below shows the impact that the earning assets and interest bearing liabilities had on the change in net interest margin for as shown  the increase in volume of earning assets resulted in an increase of 
in net interest margin 
the increase was more than offset by the effect of the decline of in rates on earning assets 
the net effect of volume and rate on earning assets was a decrease in net interest margin 
this was offset somewhat by the increase in net interest margin of 
due to the effects of change in rates and volumes of interest bearing liabilities 
the net result was a decrease in net interest margin of 
effect on margin due to changes in description volume rate net loans interest bearing bank balances investment securities total earning assets deposits other interest bearing liabilities total interest bearing liabilities net interest margin net interest margin  the tax equivalent net yield on earning assets  increased basis points during over the comparable period in the increase was due in part to many changes made in such as an improvement in risk based pricing on loans and changing the mix of the investment portfolio 
the asset liability management committee continued to be assertive in setting rates 
in addition  the percent of average time deposits to average total deposits decreased from in to in  reducing interest expense that would have offset interest income by shifting funds to less costly accounts 
further enhancing net interest margin was the growth in loans  the company s highest yielding asset 
net interest margin  the tax equivalent net yield on earning assets  increased basis points during over the comparable period in the prior year 
improvements in risk based pricing on loans  a change in the mix of the investment portfolio  and an assertive approach to pricing funding sources resulted in higher net interest margin

we did experience approximately million in loan growth during the fourth quarter of over the third quarter of and ended the year with growth primarily from real estate construction loans 

table of contents average loan to deposit ratio the year was unusual in terms of the lending environment 
first  the economy failed to rebound as quickly as expected 
secondly  we had to replace approximately  in loans resulting from payoffs from the curtailment of the sales financed division  from in house mortgages being replaced by permanent financing in the secondary market  and from the payoff of various commercial loans 
as noted  when the sales finance division was curtailed in  the loan balance was approximately  the loan balance at year end was  down  from december  despite the lack of growth on a period to period basis  we recorded  in new loans for despite the sluggish economy  total loans increased from  in  to  or  during the most significant increase occurred in the second half of  due in part to the hiring of lending staff in the desoto and lee county markets 
consumer loans decreased approximately  during  largely attributable to the curtailment of the sales finance division that occurred in the decrease in volume of the sales finance division was approximately  for and  for the average loan to deposit ratio was for new loans recorded in totaled  of which were secured by real estate 
loans were  in commercial loans  specifically first mortgage commercial real estate  provided the majority of the growth for managing the interest rate risk of the loan portfolio has been a challenge during the last three years with rates dropping to unprecedented lows 
prime was reduced eleven times during  once again in november  falling from at december  to at december   and then again in june  falling to 
as in  clients continued to request financing with extended terms in the low interest rate environment 
we employed the use of federal home loan bank borrowings to match fund loans with extended terms  primarily larger commercial and real estate loans 
average yields on loans decreased from in  to in and then to in the most significant changes occurred in commercial loans as the average yield dropped from in  to in  then to in consumer loan yields declined from in  to in  then further to in the rate declines were directly attributable to the rate adjustments made by the federal reserve bank 
the consumer loan yield for increased over as a result of improvements made in risk based pricing of our loans 
the tax equivalent loan interest income was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the tax equivalent loan interest income decreased  or in from fostered by the low interest rate environment 
coupled with this low interest rate environment was a change in the mix of the loan portfolio 
in  we experienced a significant decrease in average mortgage loans of  which was more than offset by increases in average commercial loans of  and increases in lines of credit of  both with lower yields than the mortgage loans 
in  the tax equivalent loan interest income decreased  or  from this was the result of both the low interest rate environment and a change in the mix of loans 
in  higher yielding consumer loans decreased  with approximately  of this due to the decreases in the sales finance portfolio

management continues to emphasize the growth in noninterest income by enhancing client relationships 
we understand that building these relationships will help us to reach our strategic target of five product services per client 
in may of  we launched our high performance checking hpc program 
this was the most significant new product line offered during the year 
the program  geared to consumers  simplified the demand deposit account types being offered 
by streamlining the accounts into only seven types  we not only improved our efficiency and knowledge in offering the product  but also provided a simple  straightforward product line for meeting our clients needs 
the benefits from the program include increasing our core deposits and providing an environment for cross selling other services 
the monthly service charge revenue given up through lower cost accounts was more than offset by the earnings on the additional demand deposit account balances and other services sold to those new clients 
in  we developed plans directed at selling our products  with emphasis on increasing our affluent client base 
at the beginning of  we added two executives to our financial services group  increasing the expertise we can offer to the affluent market 
the financial services division was recently relocated to a facility in the new fair park district located in tupelo 
we market ourselves as more than a bank  more than bankers since we are able to offer our clients a full range of financial services and products 
we continue to conduct events throughout our market area for the affluent group 
the events include health fairs as well as programs on topics such as fraud  street smarts  identity theft  estate planning  long term care  medicare supplements  wealth management  and retirement fundamentals 
in addition  we publish and mail a quarterly newsletter for both clients and non clients in this segment of our market 
we have noted increases in services provided and in new clients as a result of these programs 
as an extension of our strategic plan  our franchises develop their own vision and mission statements  as well as business plans for achieving their goals 
those plans include specific programs for fostering additional client relationships 
the execution of this program has resulted in greater revenue from increased sales 

table of contents for  noninterest income was  an increase of  over  or 
fees for deposit services  a major contributor to the increase in noninterest income  were up  or  over those generated in in addition  loan services provided an increase of  in fees for a growth rate of over the prior year 
of this increase   or  is attributable to fees earned through our mortgage loan division 
the bank earns fees for the origination of mortgage loans as well as the subsequent sale of those loans to the secondary market 
low interest rates provided a favorable environment for mortgage loan production  both in refinancing and in new mortgages 
this trend continued well into the third quarter with rates falling to the low percent range for a fifteen year fixed rate mortgage 
we expensed for amortization of mortgage servicing rights in mortgage servicing rights  at december   will be amortized over the expected life of the assets 
we closed approximately  in mortgage loans in  a record for our bank  up over the volume closed for of approximately  noninterest income for totaled  representing an increase of  or  over for the year  fees generated from deposit services increased  or  over the additional income generated was derived primarily from service charges on deposit accounts including overdraft fees  fees earned from use of our debit cards inclusive of interchange fees  and fees generated through our merchant business 
only minor changes were made to the fee structure on deposit account products during fees earned from loan services in were  or  greater than fees earned in fees associated with originating loans were restructured at the end of the first quarter of in order to help offset operating costs associated with offering loan products 
the new fee structure is tiered both on commercial and consumer loans and is based on loan size 
the increase in fees for attributable to the restructured fees and additional loan volume was approximately in addition  the income in includes in a prepayment penalty on a loan that was funded through the federal home loan bank 
finally  income on the sale of mortgage loans remained strong in due to both the originating and refinancing of approximately  in mortgage loans 
while the gains on mortgage loans were up moderately over  the amortization of mortgage servicing rights was up  or over we recorded additional impairment of during the fourth quarter of related to prepayments on the mortgage loans being serviced by the company 
in contrast to the past  most mortgage loans originated are sold with servicing released 
the company  however  still serviced approximately  in loans originated prior to at december  for  noninterest income was  fees were restructured on selected transaction accounts 
this  coupled with account activity  provided significant growth in deposit fees over prior years 
in addition  some administrative fees were assessed to cover the cost of handling client accounts such as returned bank statements and return items 
fees earned from loan services for were  document preparation fees  mortgage loan fees and gains on sales of mortgage loans were significant contributors to earnings 
the mortgage loan business gained momentum during as rates fell 
income earned on insurance products increased or  or  and  or  in   and  respectively 
we implemented an insurance integration plan in aimed at improving our cross selling performance between the bank and the insurance company 
a secondary benefit resulting from increased sales is the opportunity to improve contingency income 
contingency income is a bonus received from the insurance underwriters and is based both on commission income and claims experience on our clients during the previous year 
the changes in income for insurance products include a decrease of for contingency income and an increase of in and  respectively 
our financial services division encompasses trust services  annuities and mutual funds  and specialized insurance products for business and estate secession 
a team was assembled at the end of and further expanded at the beginning of in  a manager was added to improve the financial services department  which is responsible for brokerage through our third party provider 

table of contents in  the revenue generated by the financial services division increased  an improvement of over of this increase  was due to the financial services department 
the improvement in the stock market fostered the environment for increased activity 
also significant to this increase is the impact and focus from the new management in this area 
training  coupled with better sales goals  helped employees exceed the company s plan 
in  the revenue generated by this division decreased  or 
revenue from mutual fund and annuity sales decreased trust revenue was up in over  offsetting some of the decrease from other products 
the increase in trust revenue was attributable to new accounts as well as an additional basis points received on accounts from our money manager 
the renegotiation of the rate received from our money manager occurred mid year 
income for this division for was  or  greater than the prior year due to mutual fund and annuity sales 
trust revenue in declined  or from the previous year 
the reduction was due to the loss in value of the trust assets under management 
as the stock market declined  the value of the trust accounts decreased 
fees charged by the trust division are based  in part  on the value of the assets in the trust accounts 
all other revenue in increased over and over the main components of other revenue are discussed below 
cash surrender value earned on bank owned life insurance boli in was  comparable to that earned in in  however  it was greater than that earned in we purchased  in boli in late may for the purpose of offsetting the rising cost of health insurance 
boli income earned in was the bank sponsors a deferred compensation plan for qualified officers and directors 
under this plan  the company purchases life insurance on the employees and directors  based on the income deferral each individual chooses 
the company records cash surrender value income  net of insurance premiums paid  on those insurance policies each year 
upon the death of a participant in the plan  the company records life insurance proceeds

net cash surrender value earnings for   and were  and  respectively 
security gains of for resulted from  in security sales  primarily from the sale of mortgage backed securities 
securities gains of for resulted from  in security sales 
these  too  were primarily mortgage backed securities that were sold to eliminate those securities with maturity concentrations or accelerated prepayments 
sales also included securities in the agency  obligation of state and political subdivision  and other preferred stock sectors 
security gains of for resulted from  in security sales 
these securities included odd lot mortgage backed securities  preferred stock  and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the proceeds from these funds were used to reinvest in other mortgage backed securities and to fund bank owned life insurance 
noninterest expense to average assets total noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  data processing  net occupancy  equipment  and other noninterest expense 
noninterest expense was   and  for   and  respectively resulting in increases of   and for the same years  respectively 
salaries and employee benefits represented   and of total noninterest expenses at december    and  respectively 
as a percent of net interest and noninterest income  salaries and employee benefits were   and for the years   and  respectively 
salaries and employee benefits cost for was relatively flat compared to 
table of contents salaries for increased  or over due to normal annual salary increases and staff additions 
the most significant additions for were three executives  two in the financial services division and a legal counsel 
some of the increase was the result of the lending staff additions in lee and desoto counties that occurred in mid to late in addition  commission expense increased over  directly attributable to the increase in revenue generated through mortgage loans  insurance  and annuities mutual fund sales 
the incentive cost for was  less than the expense 
other increases in salaries and benefits included pension and stock option expenses which increased  up  and  or  over  respectively 
our health and life insurance cost for was down  or  due to lower claims paid in salaries for increased  or  over due to normal annual salary increases and staff additions as well 
the additions occurred in the two fastest growing markets of the company  desoto and lee counties  and were primarily lending staff to enhance the company s loan growth 
incentive cost in increased  or  over as a result of the improvement in the company s performance 
commission expense in was  or  greater than due to the additional revenue generated through insurance  mortgage and merchant sales 
our insurance producers  mortgage originators and merchant representatives are paid primarily on a commission basis 
in addition  health and life insurance cost was  or  greater than the increase in health and life insurance was due to the rising cost of insurance as well as increased claims filed for retirement plan cost in was greater than due to the increase in the company s match for the k plan as well as cost associated with the defined contribution plan 
in  data processing cost increased  or as we continued to improve our technology 
at the end of and beginning of  we installed a new loan platform system designed in part to simplify the lending process for our front line staff 
in addition  we have been customizing a loan pricing program to be installed in the first quarter of we also installed a thin client architecture  which allows for a reduction in cost for future hardware  less time and effort in providing support  and provision for better information security 
finally  we upgraded our teller platform system during the second half of to a windows based system from a dos based system 
the new system has more functionality and provides the teller with more information about the client 
data processing cost for was up  or  over the increase is attributable to volume for our merchant business as well as services with our core service provider 
the upgrade of our deposit platform system increased cost  as did the implementation of a new consumer internet banking platform 
in  data processing expenses were  during  we installed a dos based teller platform system purchased from our core service provider  metavante 
while costs related to the use of this system increased  other costs decreased such as other losses and charge offs as cash and fraud losses dissipated 
occupancy expense in was up or from approximately of the increase resulted from the recognition of impairment in the amount of on a rented building after a limited service branch office was closed 
other increases in occupancy resulted from costs incurred in the opening of a new branch office in corinth and expanding our technology center 
occupancy expense in was down from due largely to the sale of a building in january in  occupancy expense was  expense increases for were due primarily depreciation for buildings and furniture  janitorial cost  and utilities 
computer and equipment expenses for decreased  or  from no depreciation was recorded during for the capital expenses related to the thin client architecture and the teller platform systems  as all costs have not been incurred 
for and  we experienced increases of and over the prior year  respectively 
the increases for and resulted from computer and software depreciation  maintenance and support fees 
we made several technological enhancements during and including the installation of a teller platform system  and upgrading both our deposit platform system and the credit scoring module 
we also upgraded data storage to a robotic dvd device  providing near on line access to data check images  and purchased software to enhance read rates in item processing 
these upgrades have enhanced productivity  reduced losses  and provided better service for our clients 

table of contents we implemented a new loan platform system  which became operational in the first quarter of additionally  experts in that field have enhanced information security through software  hardware  and retention of services 
it has been  and will continue to be  our practice to seek technological improvements  to evaluate the benefits  and to progress with implementation of systems that are deemed beneficial for our clients and shareholders 
this practice is directly influenced by our vision to be the financial services advisor and provider of choice in the communities we serve 
the largest increase in noninterest expense for was in the other expense category 
the increase of  or  over  was largely attributable to the implementation of our high performance checking program in may while this program requires a significant financial commitment  approximately in  it has generated excellent results as openings of new demand deposit accounts have increased substantially from the prior year 
approximately has been added to interest and fee income  offsetting most of the cost 
other large expense increases for included accounting and legal fees of approximately or over  in part related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act 
we also expensed approximately for consultant assistance in various revenue enhancement projects  primarily related to deposit fees and cash management  an increase of over similar consultant cost for in september  we entered into a contract with clarke american check services 
as a result of this contract  we recorded the net earned portion of the signing bonus  approximately  as an offset to cost 
the change from the prior vendor provides us with an opportunity to offer our clients better selection and service 
finally  our other insurance cost for was higher by due to rate increases and costs incurred for other real estate 
we reduced cash short by from due largely to the teller platform system 
the new system provides more information to the teller regarding account balances resulting in lower charge offs 
other noninterest expense in was greater than increases were noted in public relations due largely to sponsorship of a hospice house  contribution to future focus for a leadership program sponsored by the lee county community development foundation  and the publication of a newsletter for senior citizens 
telephone and data line cost increased due to enhancements made in our call center and upgrades to either k data lines or t data lines at most locations for enhanced efficiency 
other fees also increased due to fees paid to consultants based on revenue enhancements generated from implementing their recommendations and fees paid to information technology consultants specifically to address our strategic technology plan  infrastructure including network assessment  and security 
other insurance expense  other than building and auto  increased over decreases in include oreo expense  down due to impairment recorded in of  other losses and charge offs down from  and intangible amortization down from as a result of compliance with fasb statement no 
the company will continue to amortize an intangible originating from a purchase in compliance with fasb statement no 
all other intangible assets will be evaluated periodically for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows 
other noninterest expense for was  the only noteworthy expense item in was the recognition of of impairment on other real estate owned 
efficiency ratio our efficiency ratio  which had been steadily improving  increased in this increase resulted primarily from decreases in the company s net interest income 
this ratio is a standard performance measurement tool which encompasses tax equivalent net interest income  noninterest income excluding security gains and noninterest expense 
the decline in the ratio from to is largely attributable to the improvement in net interest income 

table of contents net noninterest expense to average assets change in noninterest income change in noninterest expense change in noninterest income change in noninterest expense noninterest income has improved due to our offering of new products as well as increasing our client base 
as evidenced in our slogan more than a bank  we have expanded our product line from traditional banking services to a full line of financial services including insurance products  financial planning  investments and fiduciary services 
we will continue to emphasize noninterest expense control 
as the ratios and the chart above show  the percentage of additional cost incurred by the company over the last five years was more than offset by the percentage of additional revenue generated 
for   and  the dollar increase of noninterest income exceeded the dollar increase of noninterest expense 
income tax expense for   and was   and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for those years were   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for is down partially due to tax decreases as a result of tax planning strategies 
during the last three years  we continued to invest in tax exempt securities  and tax free leases and loans 
the average tax exempt securities as a percentage of the investment portfolio decreased from in to in and further to in in both and  we recorded a nontaxable death benefit from life insurance 
in  we purchased  in bank owned life insurance 
this purchase resulted in recording   and in tax exempt income for  and  respectively 
risk management the management of risk is an on going process 
primary risks that are associated with the company include credit  interest rate  and liquidity risks 
these are discussed below 
credit risk inherent in any lending activity is credit risk  that is  the risk of loss should a borrower or trading counter party default 
credit risk is monitored and managed by a loan committee and a loss management committee 
credit quality and policies are major concerns of these committees 
we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry 
the allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio 
the appropriate level of the allowance is based on a quarterly analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses  including collective impairment as recognized under fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade 
another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the balance of these loans determined as impaired under fasb statement no 
and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses 
other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments  unemployment rate in our market  loan segmentation  and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management provides additional reserves through the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses was  and  at december  and  respectively 

table of contents allowance for loan losses to loans the net charge offs for and were  and  respectively 
the net charge off ratio for was  significantly better than the peer average of 
below is a chart showing net charge offs as a percent of total net charge offs by each category 
charge off and recovery amounts by loan category are presented on page net charge offs commercial  financial  and agricultural lease financing real estate construction real estate family mortgage real estate commercial mortgage installment loans to individuals total net charge offs as a result of better execution of credit standards  net charge offs for decreased by  or from the levels and for  decreased by  or from the levels 
for  there was a significant decrease in all categories  with the largest decrease in the real estate mortgage sector in the amount of  or 
this improvement is attributed to the implementation of a more stringent loan review and evaluation process 
for  the most significant change in net charge offs was in the consumer loan sector  which decreased  or from this improvement was primarily due to the decrease in sales finance loans 
losses in sales finance loans decreased from net charge offs in real estate mortgage loans in were up  or  primarily due to the increased loan volume in that sector of  or 
net charge offs for commercial  financial and agricultural and real estate construction loans were relatively unchanged from loan losses for were  the majority of the consumer loans charged off in was in used automobiles and sales finance loans 
the charge offs in real estate mortgage loans for consisted of older credits comprised of family and nonfarm residential properties 
these losses resulted from poor underwriting 
during  we enhanced our underwriting criteria by implementing higher credit standards  by evaluating loan officer credit limits  and by more closely evaluating real estate appraisals 
management continues to monitor loans and utilize diligent collection efforts 
net charge offs to average loans nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or the loans are contractually past due days 
generally  the accrual of income is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt  or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually days past due  unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection 
during  we continued to refine the credit scoring process that was implemented in toward the end of the year  formalized underwriting standards for small business loans were implemented 
the credit scoring is used as a tool for evaluating credit risk and is proving itself as an effective tool 
management has recognized the improvement in loan quality as loans are being scored 

table of contents we have a number of documented loan policies and procedures that set forth the approval and monitoring process of the lending function 
adherence to these policies and procedures is mandated by management and the board of directors 
a number of committees and an underwriting staff oversee the lending operation of the company 
those include in house loan and loss management committees  and a board of directors loan committee 
in addition  we maintain a loan review staff 
the underwriters review and score loan requests that are made by our lending staff 
in compliance with policy  the lending staff is given lending limits based on their knowledge and experience 
in addition  each lending officer s prior performance is evaluated for credit quality and compliance as a tool for establishing and enhancing lending limits 
before funds are advanced  loans are scored by the underwriters 
grades are assigned based on the scoring of the loans that are funded 
this information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality 
loan requests of amounts greater than the officers lending limits are reviewed by an in house loan committee 
this committee is comprised of executive management 
decisions on funding loan requests are made or declined at this level provided they are within approved lending limits 
loan requests that exceed this group s lending authority are submitted to a loan committee comprised of members of the board of directors 
the allowance for loan losses is established after input from management  loan review  and the loss management committee 
an evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the types of loans  the credit risk in the portfolio  economic conditions and trends within each of these factors 
the loss management committee monitors loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor 
grades are assigned by lending personnel based on the scoring of the loans that are funded 
loan grades range from to  with being loans with the least credit risk 
allowance factors established by management are applied to each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance factors are established based on our loss experience  adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios  as well as regulatory guidelines for criticized loans 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated collectively for impairment 
for impaired loans  a specific reserve is established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its fair value 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for problem loans of or greater by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the ultimate collectibility of an impaired loan s principal is in doubt  wholly or partially  the loan is placed on nonaccrual 
loan review personnel monitor the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination 
the loss management committee monitors loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor and adjusts the loan credit grade accordingly 
this information is used to assist management in monitoring the credit quality 
the allowance for loan losses is established after input from management  loan review  and the loss management committee 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is calculated quarterly  or more frequently if management deems it necessary 
these calculations are reviewed by management and the internal loan review staff 
foreclosure proceedings are initiated after all collection efforts have failed 
the collateral is purchased from the borrower at public auction for fair market value  with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price 
the purchase price is applied to the outstanding loan balance 
if the loan balance is greater than the sales proceeds  the deficient balance is sent to the loan committee comprised of the board of directors for charge off approval 
these charge offs reduce the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is calculated quarterly 
these calculations are reviewed by management and the internal loan review staff 
if the allowance is deemed inadequate  management increases the allowance by a charge to the provision for loan losses 
on a monthly basis  management and the board of directors review loan ratios 
these ratios include the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans  the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans  nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans  and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans 
in addition  management reviews past due ratios by officer  community bank  and company 
nonperforming loans to loans for  the increase in the non performing loan ratio was due primarily to one credit which represents over of the nonperforming loans 
the party responsible for this credit is in chapter bankruptcy and the credit is therefore on nonaccrual 
it is secured by real estate and the loans are graded for loan loss purposes such that the loans less the allocated loan loss reserve approximate the fair market value of the collateral 
excluding this credit  the nonperforming loan ratio was 
and the reserve coverage ratio was in although  we have an increase in the loans on nonaccrual and past due over ninety days  there was also a decrease in total past dues over thirty days of  or

when evaluating nonaccrual and restructured loans  the interest income foregone and recognized from through was not significant 
restructured loans are those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower s financial condition 
such concessions may include reduction in interest rates  or deferral of interest or principal payments 
real estate acquired through the satisfaction of loan indebtedness oreo is recorded at the lower of cost or fair market value based on appraised value  less estimated selling costs 
any deficiency between the loan balance and the purchase price of the property at foreclosure is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent sales of the property may result in gains or losses 
oreo decreased to  at december   down from  at december  proceeds from sales of oreo for were  with losses of we acquired  in oreo during and sold  for a turnover rate of 
property both acquired and sold in generated in gains 
oreo increased in over the level 
proceeds from sales of oreo for were  with losses of interest rate risk the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories 
management believes the most significant impact on financial results stems from our ability to react to changes in interest rates 
we have an asset liability committee alco  which is authorized by the board of directors to monitor our interest rate sensitivity and to make decisions relating to that process 
the alco s goal is to maximize net interest income while providing us with an acceptable level of market risk due to changes in interest rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit taking activities 
to that end  management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure 
profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income using several tools 
one measure of our exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in the maturity and rate sensitivity analysis gap analysis 
another test measures the impact on net interest income and net portfolio value npv of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
this calculation is referred to as rate shock analysis 
npv is defined as the net present value of assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 

table of contents following is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at december percentage change in change in interest rates net interest income net portfolio value in basis points the percentage change in this column represents net interest income for months in a stable interest rate environment versus the net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change in this column represents our npv in a stable interest rate environment versus the npv in the various rate scenarios 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum yield cost spread 
we rely primarily on our asset liability strategies to control interest rate risk 
the results of the interest rate shock are within the limits set by the board of directors 
we continually evaluate interest rate risk management opportunities  including the possible use of derivative financial instruments 
at december   we had not entered into any derivative contracts or hedging instruments 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposits decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of net interest income and npv 
actual values may differ from those projections presented in cases where market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of net interest income and the npv 
liquidity risk liquidity management is the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
core deposits are a major source of funds used to meet cash flow needs 
maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of money markets is the key to assuring liquidity 
in  approximately of our time deposits were composed of accounts with balances less than when evaluating the movement of these funds  even during large interest rate changes  it is apparent that we continue to attract deposits that can be used to meet cash flow needs 
another source available for meeting our liquidity needs is available for sale securities 
the available for sale portfolio is composed of securities with a readily available market that can be converted to cash if the need arises 
during both   and  the most significant purchases of investment securities were in the mortgage backed sector 
these securities provide a monthly cash flow of both principal and interest 

table of contents we use this structure in order to provide liquidity to fund future loan growth as the economy improves 
within the next twelve months the securities available for sale portfolio is forecasted to generate cash flow equal to of the par value of the total securities portfolio 
our bank also originates balloon payment notes 
these are loans with large principal payments at the end of the term 
these loans in addition to repayments and maturities provide substantial sources of liquidity 
approximately or our loans mature or reprice within the next twelve months 
the bank also has available proceeds from the issuance of junior subordinated debentures that may be used for liquidity needs 
in addition  we maintain federal funds lines and may also obtain advances from the federal home loan bank 
the bank continues to attempt to increase and diversify the bank s various funding sources  while simultaneously seeking the lowest possible funding cost
