item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we intend for this discussion and analysis to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of october  and for the year then ended and the notes accompanying those consolidated financial statements 
executive overview we design  manufacture  market  and sell non invasive resuscitation devices and software solutions 
our products include pacing and defibrillation devices zoll s m series and aed plus  and lifecor  inc s lifevest wearable defibrillator  a circulatory assist device advanced circulatory systems  inc s resqpod circulatory enhancer  and a unique fluid resuscitation product called the power infuser  manufactured by infusion dynamics  a division of zoll 
these devices help healthcare professionals  emergency medical service providers  and first responders diagnose and treat victims of trauma  as well as sudden cardiac arrest 
through our subsidiary zoll data systems formerly pinpoint technologies  we also design and market software that automates the collection and management of both clinical and non clinical data 
we ended fiscal in a strong financial position  despite mixed sales performance during the year 
we have a healthy balance sheet with million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and no long term debt 
net income in fiscal was lower than expected due to sales growth that did not keep pace with our significant investments in sales  marketing and r d resources 
we expect to see good revenue growth in fiscal along with increased earnings as we leverage the operational investments we have made the past few years 
compared to sales our net sales increased in fiscal to a record million  up from million in the prior year  reflecting continued growth in sales volume of our core m series product and our aed plus product 
net sales by customer product categories were as follows s omitted change devices and accessories to the hospital market north america devices  accessories  and data management software to the pre hospital market north america other products to north america subtotal north america all products to the international market total sales the increase of sales to the north american hospital market was primarily due to million of additional volume to the us military which included million of product shipped from infusion dynamics  the company we acquired in march excluding the us military sales of approximately million in  north american hospital revenues increased over the prior year 
of this increase  million was due to increased sales of our aed plus in the hospital market and approximately million was due to increased sales of the m series 
the increase of m series sales includes the impact of some customers accelerating their replacement of monophasic devices 
for usmilitary sales  we do not anticipate a repeat of the volumes 
we are estimating that sales to various branches of the us military will approximate million in fiscal our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased due to approximately million of growth in the sales of our aed plus product driven by volume and market share gains and approximately million was due to growth in volume of our data management software revenues 
the million decrease of international sales was caused primarily by a million decrease due to german army purchases which occurred in but did not recur in further  our united kingdom sales decreased approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million or due to favorable foreign exchange rates and approximately million or of additional sales volume in our australian operations as we continue to gain market share there 
worldwide aed plus product sales reached million  an increase of over the prior year 
this increase results from increased volume of shipments and additional market share since we believe this market is growing at approximately per year 
gross margins gross margins for fiscal increased slightly to  from in fiscal the increase in gross margins was mainly due to a lower proportion of international sales in as compared to total sales 
many international sales  including those to the german army in  included volume discounts  and sales to international distributors which typically carry lower than average gross margins drove margins lower in backlog we do not typically maintain a significant backlog 
typically our sales force has to sell most of each quarter s revenue in that quarter 
orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers 
due to possible changes in delivery schedules  cancellation of orders and delays in shipments  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily an accurate predictor of revenue for any succeeding period 
we ended the year with a capital equipment backlog of approximately million  which we expect to ship during the first quarter of fiscal as we continue to grow  in order to facilitate shipments given heavy end of quarter orders  we believe we need to establish a permanent backlog of orders that will not be shipped at the end of each quarter 
over the course of  we hope to establish such a backlog of approximately to million 
costs and expenses operating expenses were as follows s omitted of sales of sales change selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total expenses selling and marketing expenses increased million for the year ended october  the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to million for the expansion of our north american and international sales forces and the associated personnel and travel costs 
outside professional services of approximately million including public relations and other marketing consulting  and approximately million for direct mailing  advertising  and other promotional items also contributed to the overall increase 
general and administrative expenses increased million for the year ended october  the increase over the prior year was primarily due to an increase in professional services including information technology consulting of approximately  and sarbanes oxley compliance consulting of approximately  recruiting costs increased by approximately  to support the growth of our business and its infrastructure 
additionally  we experienced increases to our product liability insurance premiums of approximately  due to the increased volume of products sold 
research and development r d expenses increased million for the year ended october  approximately million of this increase was due to the hiring of additional personnel and approximately  was due to the increased use of outside professional design services 
investment and other income investment and other income decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower foreign exchange gains due to slightly more stable exchange rates in fiscal when compared to fiscal income taxes our effective tax rate decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this reduction in the effective tax rate is mainly due to increased export trade incentives utilized in these incentives are being phased out beginning in  however  the american jobs creation act  passed into law in october  will likely give us similar incentives and results 
compared to sales our net sales increased in fiscal to a record million  up from million in the prior year  reflecting continued growth of our core m series product as we continue to capture market share and the growing demand for our aed plus product 
net sales by customer product categories were as follows s omitted change devices and accessories to the hospital market north america devices  accessories  and data management software to the pre hospital market north america other products to north america subtotal north america all products to the international market total sales the increase in the north american hospital market was mainly due to million of m series cct shipments to the us military for their pmi patient movement item program 
without the us military  our sales in the north american hospital market remained relatively flat year to year 
we believe this was due to the slowdown in the north american economy 
our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased primarily due to million growth in our data management software revenues and million growth in sales of our new aed plus product  partially offset by a million decrease in capital equipment sale volume as budget constraints continued to affect state and municipal spending on ems services 
our aed plus product has generated approximately million in total sales in its first full year  of which approximately were sold in north america 
this is compared to aed plus sales of million last year  with approximately sold in north america 
this increase reflects the results of the addition of approximately aed plus distributors and manufacturer s representatives in the north american market along with the addition of in house distributor managers and regional managers for this market and the addition to our direct sales force compared to the prior year 
the increase in international sales reflects continued volume growth in all of our direct sales organizations and in our international distributor sales  particularly in europe  the middle east and china 
an increase in foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately million or to this increase 
gross margins gross margins for fiscal decreased to  from in fiscal the decreased margins are due to sales to the us military and increased sales to the german army  which included volume discounts 
costs and expenses operating expenses were as follows s omitted of sales of sales change selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total expenses selling and marketing expenses increased million for the year ended september  the increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily due to increases in personnel and travel costs of approximately million  reflecting additional headcount to our north american sales force and the expansion of our international operations 
we also spent approximately million on additional tradeshow participation  advertising and other promotional items  and provided additional training and equipment to our worldwide sales force 
general and administrative expenses increased million primarily due to approximately million for an increase in wages and related benefits for an expanded headcount to support the larger organization  with the remainder driven primarily by an increase in general liability insurance premiums 
research and development expenses increased million 
our continued investment in research and development reflects significant resources devoted to data management  product variants of the m series and aed plus product lines  continued clinical trials  expansion of our long term technical research efforts  and expansion of other r d initiatives 
investment and other income investment and other income increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in the previous year 
this increase was primarily due to approximately million of foreign exchange gains offset by approximately  of lower investment earnings due to lower cash balances invested at lower interest rates over the prior year 
income taxes our effective tax rate remained consistent at in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflecting continued research and development credits for our r d activity  along with foreign earnings taxed at differing rates  and the utilization of foreign loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources our overall financial condition remains strong 
our cash and cash equivalents at october  totaled million compared with million at september  in addition  we had marketable securities amounting to million at october  in comparison to million at september  we continue to have no long term debt 
cash requirements we believe that the combination of existing cash  cash equivalents  and highly liquid short term investments on hand  along with future cash to be generated by operations and amounts available under our line of credit will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
sources and uses of cash to assist with the discussion  the following table presents the abbreviated cash flows for the years ended october   september   and september  s omitted net income changes not affecting cash changes in current assets and liabilities cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents beginning of year cash and cash equivalents end of year operating activities the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in our net income year to year which was responsible for million of the decrease 
net income was lower than expected due to sales growth that did not keep pace with our significant investments in sales  marketing and r d resources 
offsetting the decrease in net income  was a net increase in other changes which affected net income but did not affect cash  such as million increase in depreciation  and   for inventory reserves 
depreciation expense was higher in because of an increased investment in computer equipment and demo equipment deployed to our growing sales force 
changes in current assets and liabilities caused a decrease in cash of approximately million for compared to because of the timing of payments for the year end investing activities the million decrease in cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the fact that we received approximately million of cash in from the net sales of marketable securities compared to when we used approximately million of cash for the net purchases of marketable securities 
in  we made a million advance to revivant corporation in the form of a note receivable 
in  we also generated approximately million in cash from the sale of our building in boulder colorado where our data management software business offices were located 
we subsequently leased more office space in broomfield  colorado for this growing business 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal in comparison to million in the previous year 
the change reflects a higher number of stock options exercised during approximately  shares in versus  in at a higher average exercise price per share in verses in 
investments as of october   we had investments in privately held technology companies with a carrying value of million 
we have performed a review of these investments and determined the carrying value of these investments approximates their fair value 
in march  we acquired substantially all the assets of infusion dynamics  inc infusion 
under the terms of the acquisition  we are obligated to make additional earn out payments through and royalty payments through contingencies based on performance of the acquired business 
because additional consideration is based on the growth of sales  a reasonable estimate of the future payments to be made cannot be determined 
when these contingencies are resolved and the consideration is distributable  we will record the fair value of the additional consideration as additional cost of the acquired assets 
we exercised our option to acquire revivant corporation revivant on october  we paid million in the form of cash and shares of our common stock as the initial merger consideration 
we may also be required to make future milestone payments  estimated to be approximately million  tied to the completion of certain clinical trials of the autopulse resuscitation system through we may also make additional payments for the years through based on the growth of the autopulse sales 
because additional consideration is based on the growth of the autopulse sales  a reasonable estimate of the potential total purchase price cannot be determined 
all payments will generally be a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
we also have an option exercisable through october to acquire the remainder of lifecor s assets 
if the option is exercised  we will make earn out payments to lifecor s shareholders based upon future revenue growth of the acquired business over a five year period 
because additional consideration is based on the growth of sales over a five year period  a reasonable estimate of the total acquisition cost cannot be determined 
we are also providing a working capital line of credit to lifecor secured by lifecor s accounts receivable and other assets  which had a principal balance as of october  and september  of  and  respectively 
debt instruments and related covenants we maintain a working capital line of credit with our bank 
under this working capital line  we may borrow on a demand basis 
currently  we may borrow up to million at an interest rate equal to the bank s base rate 
no borrowings were outstanding on this line during fiscal there are no covenants related to this line of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements consist of non cancelable operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and one minimum purchase commitment contract for a critical raw material component 
the table shown below in the next section titled contractual obligations and other commercial commitments shows the amounts of our operating lease commitments and purchase commitments payable by year 
for liquidity purposes  we choose to lease our facilities and automobiles instead of purchasing them 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables set forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations in s total less than year years years after years non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations include all legally binding contracts which are non cancelable 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods and services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based upon our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above 
these include the milestone payments  tied to the completion of certain clinical trials of the autopulse resuscitation system through these arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met 
as of october   assuming all future milestones were met  additional required payments would be approximately million in cash and zoll stock 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon future performance and growth of sales are not included in the table above 
these include the additional earn out payments and royalty payments for infusion dynamics through fiscal  additional earn out payments for revivant corporation through fiscal  and if we exercise our option  the additional earn out payments for lifecor through fiscal because all of these earn out and royalty payments are based upon the growth of sales over several years  a reasonable estimate of the future payment obligations cannot be determined 
critical accounting estimates our management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  even though in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make certain estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and to make difficult and subjective judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  and our most critical accounting estimates include accounts receivable reserves  warranty reserves  inventory reserves  and the valuation of long lived assets 
management continually reviews its accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies  which include revenue recognition and those that require significant estimates and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of cardiac resuscitation devices  disposable electrodes and accessories are recognized when a signed non cancelable purchase order exists  the product is shipped  title and risk have passed to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
circumstances which generally preclude the immediate recognition of revenue include shipping terms of fob destination or the existence of a customer acceptance clause in a contract based upon customer inspection of the product 
in these instances  revenue is deferred until adequate documentation is obtained to ensure that these criteria have been fulfilled 
similarly  revenues from the sales of our products to distributors fall under the same guidelines 
for all significant orders placed by our distributors  we require an approved purchase order  we perform a credit review  and we ensure that the terms on the purchase order or contract are proper and do not include any contingencies which preclude revenue recognition 
we do not offer any special right of return  stock rotation or price protection to our distributors or the end customers 
our sales to customers often include a cardiac resuscitation device  disposable electrodes and other accessories 
for the vast majority of our shipments  all deliverables are shipped together 
in cases where some elements of a multiple element arrangement are not delivered as of a reporting date  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and only recognize the revenue related to the delivered elements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns 
some sales to customers of our cardiac resuscitation devices may include some data collection software 
the cardiac resuscitation device and software product can operate independently of each other and one does not impede the functionality of the other 
in cases where both elements are included in a customer s order but only one has been delivered by the reporting date  we defer the fair value of the undelivered element and recognize the revenue related to the delivered item 
we also license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including training  installation  consulting and maintenance  which consist of product support services  periodic updates and unspecified upgrade rights collectively  post contract customer support pcs 
revenue from the sale of software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
license fee revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenues from maintenance agreements and upgrade rights are recognized ratably over the period of service 
revenue for services  such as software deployment  is recognized when the deployment is completed 
our software arrangements contain multiple elements  which include software products  services and pcs 
generally  we do not sell computer hardware products with our software products 
we will occasionally facilitate the hardware purchase by providing information to the customer such as where to purchase the equipment 
we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our software products 
we do  however  have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for items such as technical services  maintenance  upgrades and support for the software products based upon the price charged when such items are sold separately 
accordingly  for transactions where vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements but not for delivered elements  we use the residual method as discussed in sop  modification of sop  with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
we do not ship any of our software products to distributors or resellers 
our software products are sold only by our sales force directly to the end user 
we may sell software to system integrators who provide complete solutions to end users on a contract basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts sales returns and allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  which are included in bad debt expense  resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  credit history and current economic condition 
we also maintain an estimate of potential future product returns and discounts given related to trade ins and to current period product sales 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which are included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
as of october  our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances of million 
we believe our reported allowances at october  are adequate 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances  resulting in additional expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
warranty reserves our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  usually one to five years 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product is shipped and revenue is recognized 
the costs which we estimate include material  labor  and shipping 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at october  is adequate to cover future costs for the servicing of our products sold through that date and under warranty 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory reserves significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated  obsolete  or because the amount on hand is in excess of future needs 
we provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
we estimate excess inventory amounts by reviewing quantities on hand and comparing those quantities to sales forecasts for the next months  identifying historical service usage trends and matching that usage with the installed base quantities to estimate future needs 
at october   our inventory reserves were million  or of our million gross inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
goodwill and other intangibles at october   we had approximately million in goodwill primarily resulting from our acquisition of infusion dynamics 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units 
fair value is determined based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the reporting units 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment on the part of management about future revenues  expenses and other assumptions that contribute to the net cash flows of the reporting units 
additionally  we periodically review our goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment indicator has occurred 
investments at october   we had million in investments in privately held companies focused in the medical devices industry 
these investments are carried at cost 
we periodically review the fair value of our investments to determine if impairment has occurred 
we estimate the fair value of these investments based on an analysis of discounted cash flows 
if we determine that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment charge to adjust the carrying value to estimated fair value  if the impairment is deemed other than temporary 
the estimate of fair value of these investments  and the determination of whether impairment is temporary  requires that management make significant judgments that could affect the timing and amount of any impairment charge recorded 
long lived assets we periodically review the carrying amount of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  and intangible assets  to assess potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the determination includes evaluation of factors such as current market value  business climate and future cash flows expected to result from the use of the related assets 
our policy is to use undiscounted cash flows in assessing potential impairment and to record an impairment loss in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
this process requires judgment on the part of management 
safe harbor statements certain statements contained herein constitute forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of the act and releases issued by the securities and exchange commission and within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate and other expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
particularly  the company s expectations regarding future operational liquidity  contractual obligations and other commercial commitments  and capital requirements are forward looking statements 
reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the length and severity of the current economic slowdown and its impact on capital spending budgets  the potential disruption in the transportation industry on the company s supply chain and product distribution channels and those other risks and uncertainties contained under the heading risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have cash equivalents and marketable securities that primarily consist of money market accounts and fixed rate asset backed corporate securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities within one to five years 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the term and type of our investments and those fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have international offices in canada  united kingdom  netherlands  france  germany  austria  and australia 
these subsidiaries transact business in their functional or local currency 
therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies  along with economic and political instability in the foreign countries in which we operate  all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we use forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies as well as forecasted sales to subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
a forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these forward contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables and forecasted sales are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings generally in the same period as exchange gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables and forecasted sales are recognized 
we had one forward exchange contract outstanding serving as a hedge of our euro denominated intercompany receivables in the notional amount of approximately million euros at october  the contract serves as a hedge of a substantial portion of our euro denominated intercompany balances and settles on january  the fair value of the foreign currency derivative contract outstanding at october  was approximately million resulting in an unrealized loss of  a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of the euro derivative foreign exchange contract outstanding at october  indicates that  if the us dollar weakened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would decrease by  resulting in a total loss on the contract of  conversely  if the us dollar strengthened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would increase by  resulting in a total gain on the contract of  any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contract would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transaction 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the analysis above 
intercompany receivable hedge exchange rate sensitivity october  amounts in expected maturity dates total unrealized gain loss thereafter forward exchange agreements receive pay euro contract amount average contract exchange rate we had four forward exchange contracts outstanding serving as a hedge of a portion our forecasted sales to our subsidiaries in the notional amount of approximately million at october  these contracts mature on january  the fair value of the foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding at october  was approximately million 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of the derivative foreign exchange contracts outstanding at october  indicates that  if the us dollar weakened by  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by  resulting in a total loss on the contracts of  conversely  if the us dollar strengthened by  the fair value of these contracts would increase by  resulting in a total gain on the contracts of  any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contract would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transaction 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the analysis above
