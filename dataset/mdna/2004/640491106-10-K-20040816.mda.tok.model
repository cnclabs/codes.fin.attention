critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates  including those related to receivable allowances  inventories and intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different  assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies reflect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
this is generally at the time of shipment 
where right of return exists  allowances are made at the time of sale to reflect expected returns based on historical experience 
accounts receivable allowance management attempts to minimize credit risk by reviewing customers credit history before extending credit and by monitoring credit exposure on a regular basis 
an allowance for possible losses on accounts receivable is established based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information  such as changes in overall changes in customer credit and general credit conditions 
actual collections can differ from historical experience  and if economic or business conditions deteriorate significantly  adjustments to these reserves could be required 

table of contents inventory obsolete inventory is written off as it is identified against the reserve 
product obsolescence may be caused by shelf life expiration  discontinuance of a product line  replacement products in the marketplace or other competitive situations 
a reserve for obsolescence is established based on an analysis of the inventory taking into account the current condition of the asset as well as other known facts and future plans 
the amount of reserve required to record inventory at lower of cost or market may be adjusted as conditions change 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill management assesses goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment on no less often than an annual basis 
this test was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal and it was determined that no impairment exists 
there was also no impairment indicated for or in the event of changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  management will make an assessment at any time 
factors that could cause an impairment review to take place would include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the use of acquired assets or strategy of the company 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the carrying value is compared to a value determined based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
any impairment identified in this computation is given current recognition in any unissued financial statements 
changes to the discount rate used in the analysis or discounted cash flows can have a significant impact on the results of the impairment test 
results of operations executive overview on an overall basis  the fiscal year had excellent increases in comparison with the fiscal year ended may  primarily as a result of revenue increases in the animal safety segment 
a portion of the animal safety segment s revenue increases came from the company s late november acquisitions of hacco  inc and hess clark  inc 
that were reported as new components of this segment in the current year 
additionally  animal safety segment revenue growth from continuing products increased following a year in which the segment experienced little growth 
growth came as a result of economic improvements in certain markets and from implementation of the segment s sales and marketing plans 
food safety segment revenues increased with difficult revenue comparisons in the current year following large weather related sales increases in the prior year 
the segment had successes during the year in sales of test kits for listeria  salmonella  and allergens and increased sales of test kits for genetically modified organisms to south america 
while total revenues were up  net income was up principally as a result of changes in product mix on overall gross margins  the effect of reorganization expenses related to the closing of the chicago manufacturing operation that consolidated the veterinary instruments business to other locations within the company and integration costs of the hacco and hess clark acquisitions  all offset by strong control of other costs

coli 
sales of diagnostic test kits for the detection of listeria and salmonella increased by and respectively in comparison with the prior year 
these increases were the result of increased market penetration and general acceptance of these product offerings 
other sales increased by principally due to increased penetration into the dehydrated cultured media markets and from increased sales of test kits to south america to detect soybeans that have been genetically modified to make them tolerant to roundup herbicides 
in the year ended may   food safety sales increased in comparison with the year ended may  each of the lansing based product groups contributed to the increase with a increase coming from sales of tests to detect bacterial pathogens and general sanitation testing products 
additional increases resulted in a increase coming from sales of products to detect natural toxins and allergen detection products 
an outbreak of aflatoxin in the midwest in contributed to the sharp increase in sales of natural toxin detection products 
growth in sales of detection products for several other natural toxins was strong as awareness for the need for testing for these toxins had increased 
the growth in allergen detection products is fueled by public and producer recognition of this food safety problem 
sales of acumedia  the company s dehydrated culture media manufacturing subsidiary  increased in with continued penetration into food safety markets and the addition of other customers 
within the animal safety business segment  sales of life sciences and other related products increased in comparison with the prior year 
life sciences and other products sales include sales of diagnostic products for detection of drugs of abuse in performance animals and life science products used by customers in research projects 
testing markets for drugs of abuse in performance animals is generally a mature market with revenues steady between the years 
markets for products marketed for use in the research and development of life sciences are cyclical  which accounted for the small growth in the category in following excellent growth in

neogen has been profitable from operations for its last quarters and has generated positive cash flow from operations during the period 
however  the company s current funds may not be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements to commercialize products currently under development or its plans to acquire additional technology and products that fit within the company s mission statement 
accordingly  the company may be required to issue equity securities or enter into other financing arrangements for a portion of the company s future capital needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company has minimal interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk exposure and no fixed rate investments or borrowings 
the company s primary interest rate risk is due to potential fluctuations of interest rates for variable rate borrowings 
generally  sales are dominated in us dollars  however  because neogen markets and sells its products throughout the world  it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products 

table of contents neogen has assets  liabilities and operations outside of the united states that are located primarily in ayr  scotland where the function currency is the british pound 
the company s investment in its foreign subsidiary is considered long term 
accordingly  the company does not hedge its net investment or engage in other foreign currency hedging activities due to the insignificance of these balances to the company as a whole
