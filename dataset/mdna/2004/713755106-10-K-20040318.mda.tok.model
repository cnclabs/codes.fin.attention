item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the following text contains references to years   and  which refer to our fiscal years ending or ended january   january   december  and december   respectively  unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires 
we use a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december consequently  we periodically have a week fiscal year 
our year was a week fiscal year 
our and years were week years 
all share and per share data has been adjusted to reflect the two for one common stock split that we paid on april  overview we earn revenues primarily from the sale of food and non food products to the foodservice  or food away from home  industry 
we also sell pre cut produce to food retailers 
our expenses consist mainly of cost of goods sold  which includes the amounts paid to manufacturers or growers for products and processing costs of our fresh cut produce  and operating expenses  which include primarily labor related expenses  delivery costs and occupancy expenses related to our facilities 
for further discussion of our business and strategies  see the business section of this form k 
within foodservice distribution  we have two business segments broadline and customized 
broadline s customers are mainly independent restaurants  referred to as street customers  and local locations of multi unit chains 
typically  our broadline segment supplies a portion of our customers food and non food needs 
these customers may also use other suppliers for some of their food and non food needs 
our broadline customers are generally located within miles of one of our broadline distribution centers in the eastern  midwestern  northeastern  southern and southeastern united states 
one of our broadline strategies is to grow sales to independent restaurants  as these restaurants typically use more of our value added services  such as menu planning  which result in higher margin sales 
secondly  we intend to increase sales of our proprietary brands to our broadline customers 
proprietary brands are produced for us under our labels  and generally result in higher margins fo r us than sales of comparable national brands and offer our customers added value 
we also plan to penetrate existing customers and establish new accounts in existing markets 
finally  we intend to grow through acquisitions of existing companies that are complementary to our current broadline business 
our customized segment customers consist of family and casual dining chain restaurants 
our customized segment supplies most of the food and non food needs of these customers 
therefore  average delivery sizes in our customized segment are significantly larger than average delivery sizes in our broadline segment 
customized segment customers can be located up to  miles away from one of our seven customized distribution centers  located throughout the united states 
our customized segment also supplies products to some of its customers locations internationally 
we plan to increase our customized segment sales by growing with existing customers and targeting new growth oriented customers 
we are constructing a new customized distribution facility in indiana to increase capacity for future growth and decrease miles driven to our current customer locations in the midwest 
our fresh cut segment processes and distributes ready to eat salads and other fresh cut produce 
fresh cut s fresh express packaged  ready to eat salads are the market share leader in the united states in the retail value added salad category 
fresh cut s customers include both food retail and foodservice customers nationwide 
fresh cut has nine facilities located throughout the united states 
we plan to grow our fresh cut segment sales by introducing new products  selling more products to existing and new customers  and through utilizing our foodservice and retail distribution channels to take advantage of selling opportunities across both markets 
we are continually focusing on product innovation  such as new lettuce blend varieties and fresh cut fruit 
finally  we plan to create a competitive advantage by managing the supply chain to enhance our products freshness 
according to an industry research firm  consumer purchases of food away from home in the united states represent approximately of consumer spending on food purchases and are predicted to represent of total us projected consumer food and beverage spending by  surpassing retail in its share of the consumer food dollar 
another industry research firm is projecting foodservice distributor sales to continue to grow in we believe the trends that are fueling the demand for food away from home include the aging baby boomer generation  rising incomes and more women working outside of the home 
according to industry research  older adults on average spend significantly more on food away from home than younger adults do 
in addition  younger and higher income consumers are increasingly starved for time and looking for ways to save time by shifting meal preparation to others by dining out or buying prepared or convenience foods 
the foodservice distribution industry is fragmented and consolidating 
in the last decade  the largest broadline foodservice distributors have significantly increased their collective market share through both acquiring smaller foodservice distributors and internal growth 
over the past decade  we have supplemented our internal growth through selective  strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the consolidation trends in the foodservice distribution industry will continue to present acquisition opportunities for us 
consumers are seeking healthier menu choices  as evidenced by the recent demand for our premium salads at quick service restaurants 
several national casual dining restaurants  including certain of our customers  have introduced low carb menu items in an effort to meet the demands of consumers seeking to reduce their carbohydrate intake 
in addition  in an effort to reduce meal preparation time  consumers are seeking prepared or partially prepared food items from retail establishments 
our fresh express branded products sold by retailers are targeting ready to eat convenience foods  which we believe is one of the fastest growing categories for retailers 
in  sales of food away from home continued to show positive growth 
our net sales in increased over  with of our sales growth coming from existing operations and from acquisitions 
the extra week in contributed to sales growth  and inflation contributed approximately to our growth in sales in all of our business segments experienced some food price inflation in  with our broadline and fresh cut segments noting significant inflation in the fourth quarter of due to food product cost increases and price volatility  especially in the fourth quarter of  these segments had difficulty passing along these costs increases to their customers  negatively affecting gross margins 
we expect some of this pressure on gross margin to continue into the first quarter of the results of quality foods  inc  a broadline company that we acquired in may  negatively affected the results of operations of our broadline segment 
in an effort to improve quality foods operating results  we have made significant management changes at quality foods 
we also expect to add a significant amount of multi unit business at quality foods in our customized segment was negatively affected in by a labor dispute at one of our facilities  resulting in increased costs for replacement workers  additional security and legal services 
we expect these increased costs to continue into until the labor dispute is resolved 
in addition  our fresh cut segment was affected by major disruptions to its lettuce supply in  due to increased demand and adverse weather conditions 
we are implementing additional measures to attempt to mitigate the agricultural risks impacting our fresh cut segment 
because of unanticipated increased demand from retail and quick service restaurant customers for our tender leaf salad products  and the slower speed and physical capacity of the processing equipment used for these salad products  our fresh cut segment was negatively impacted by inefficiencies in processing operations during we are making improvements to several of our existing production lines and will be installing two new tender leaf production lines during the first and second quarters of to increase production capacity 
despite the challenges we faced in  we remain optimistic about our future growth 
a large number of our associates are shareholders  primarily through the employee savings and stock ownership plan  the employee stock purchase plan  and stock options  which  we believe  makes them increasingly committed to improving our performance 
for further discussion of our stock ownership plans  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
in the last year  we have centralized some of our broadline management reporting functions  added a significant amount of new business in our customized segment and seen high customer demand for our fresh cut salad products 
we continue to seek innovative means of servicing our customers and providing a unique product to distinguish ourselves from others in the marketplace

the rd week contributed approximately million  or  to broadline net sales growth 
in and  we continued to increase sales to independent restaurants and generated incremental sales to existing customers and markets 
we refer to independent restaurants serviced by our sales representatives as street customers 
street customers tend to use more of our proprietary brands and value added services  resulting in higher margin sales 
sales to street customers as a percentage of total broadline net sales increased to in from in and in addition  we continued to increase sales of our proprietary brands  which typically generate higher margins than national brands 
sales of our proprietary brands represented of street sales in  compared to in and in sales per delivery for companies owned by us for more than one year  which measures sales to existing customers  increased in compared to  and increased in compared to we expect to stop servicing certain wendy s quick service restaurant loc ations in the first quarter of our annual sales to these wendy s locations totaled million 
however  we anticipate rolling out new multi unit chain business during the first quarter of  which we expect to generate approximately million of annualized sales 
we expect to incur certain incremental costs in the first quarter of related to this new business 
broadline acquisition sales growth resulted from our acquisitions of quality foods  inc in may  middendorf meat company and thoms proestler company and tpc logistics  inc  collectively tpc  in july  springfield foodservice corporation in september  and empire seafood holding corp 
and empire imports  inc  collectively empire seafood  in april these acquisitions are discussed below in business combinations 
broadline net sales represented  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
the increase as a percentage of our consolidated net sales in compared to is due primarily to the acquisitions of quality foods  middendorf meat and tpc 
the decrease as a percentage of our consolidated net sales in compared to is due mainly to the acquisition of fresh international corp  referred to as fresh express  in october  reported in our fresh cut segment 
the acquisition of fresh express is discussed below in business combinations 
customized 
in  customized net sales increased million  or  over in  customized net sales increased million  or  from we estimate that our customized segment experienced nominal food product inflation in we estimate that food product deflation of approximately dampened customized net sales growth in the rd week contributed approximately million  or  to net sales growth in the increase in customized net sales in is primarily due to approximately million of annualized sales to additional ruby tuesday restaurant locations beginning in the third quarter of  additional tgi friday s casual dining restaurants beginning in the fourth quarter of  mimi s caf casual dining restaurants beginning in the first quarter of  and additional ruby tuesday locations beginning in the second quarter of additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we discontinued our relationship with avado brands  inc  which accounted for approximately million  or approximately  of our customized net sales in ruby tuesday was a new casual dining chain customer in the fourth quarter of  which contributed to the increase in customized net sales 
additional ruby tuesday and tgi friday s locations serviced in  discussed above  also contributed to the increase in customized net sales 
sales growth in bot h and also benefited from the continued growth in sales to existing customers 
customized net sales represented  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
the increase as a percentage of our consolidated net sales in compared to is due primarily to sales to the new customers discussed above 
the decrease as a percentage of our consolidated net sales in compared to is due to our acquisition of fresh express in october  which is reported in our fresh cut segment and discussed below in business combinations 
fresh cut 
in  fresh cut net sales increased million  or  over in  fresh cut net sales increased million  or  over all of our net sales growth was from existing operations 
net sales in our existing fresh cut operations in increased over the acquisition of fresh express in the fourth quarter of contributed to fresh cut net sales growth for we estimate that food product inflation contributed approximately and to fresh cut net sales growth in and  respectively 
the rd week contributed approximately million  or  to fresh cut net sales growth 
in  fresh cut net sales grew because of increased sales volume to foodservice and retail customers and favorable changes in product mix towards higher value added products 
the increase in sales volume is due mainly to increased sales of tender leaf premium salad products to quick service restaurants and retail customers 
the tender leaf products for retail customers and premium salads for foodservice operators sell at a higher price per pound than products consisting mainly of iceberg lettuce 
in  the increase in fresh cut net sales in existing operations was due primarily to increased sales of premium lettuce to quick service restaurants and increased sales of sliced tomatoes to additional locations of existing and new foodservice customers  despite a reduced rate of sales growth to the quick service restaurant industry compared to  and the loss of sales to independent foodservice distributors  mainly resulting from our acquisition of fresh express 
fresh cut segment net sales represented  and of our consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
the decrease as a percentage of our consolidated net sales in compared to is due to the sales growth in our broadline and customized segments

cost of goods sold in  cost of goods sold increased million  or  to billion 
in  cost of goods sold increased million  or  to billion from billion in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales  or the cost of goods sold ratio  was in  in and in the increase in the cost of goods sold ratio in compared to is due to the factors discussed below 
the decline in the cost of goods sold ratio in compared to is due primarily to the acquisition of fresh express  which previously had a lower cost of goods sold ratio than our other operating segments 
the decrease in the cost of goods sold ratio was partially offset by the springfield foodservice ammonia leak  discussed below 
broadline 
our broadline segment s cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales in increased compared to quality foods  one of our broadline companies  which we acquired in may  has a higher cost of goods sold ratio than our other broadline companies 
the inclusion of quality foods for a full year in negatively impacted our results 
additionally  quality foods has lost two of its regional sales groups to competitors and has experienced erosion in its cost of goods sold ratio due to competitive pressures 
we have made management changes at quality foods and expect to add multi unit business at quality foods in although we expect these changes to improve quality foods cost of goods sold ratio  we expect the negative impact of quality foods to continue in in the fourth quarter of  our broadline segment experienced a significant increase in product costs that was not entirely passed through to customers during the fourth quarter  which adversely affected that segment s results of operations 
in addition  late in december  the united states department of agriculture announced the discovery of mad cow disease in an isolated herd in washington state 
this discovery led to a sharp decline in beef prices at the end of december therefore  beef inventory that was purchased at higher costs was devalued at the end of the year  resulting in a slight inventory markdown impacting cost of goods sold in december positively impacting cost of goods sold in the broadline segment in was an additional million of insurance proceeds received in the fourth quarter of  related to the springfield foodservice ammonia leak 
in july  we discovered an ammonia leak in the refrigeration system at our springfield foodservice facility in massachusetts 
although there were no injuries and the leak was confined to the facility  the leak did cause physical damage at the facility and negatively affected the sales and operating profit of our broadline segment 
in  broadline s cost of goods sold included million related to damaged inventory  net of million of insurance coverage  attributable to the ammonia leak 
despite the impact of the springfield foodservice ammonia leak  our broadline segment s cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased in compared to due to an increased percentage of our broadline sales to street customers and from increased sales of our proprietary brands  which generally result in higher margins 
sales to street customers and sales of our proprietary brands are both discussed in net sales 
customized 
our customized segment s cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales declined in compared to and as a result of changes in pricing  product mix and customer mix 
fresh cut 
our fresh cut segment s cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales increased in compared to related to the growth of our tender leaf premium salad products and increased lettuce costs 
the unexpected  rapid growth in sales of our tender leaf salad products in  discussed in net sales  created inefficiencies in our processing and warehousing activities due to the slower speeds of the tender leaf processing equipment and the related physical capacity consumed by these processing lines 
we are making improvements to a number of our existing production lines and will be installing two additional tender leaf production lines to increase production capacity during the first and second quarters of during the second quarter of  the cost of lettuce was affected by industry wide increased demand from quick service restaurants for new premium salad products supplied by our fresh cut segment 
this level of demand was not anticipated when growers made their planting decisions  which resulted in a significant increase in market prices for lettuce 
while we routinely contract for the vast majority of our lettuce needs  the success of these products meant that we had to make additional market purchases at higher prices to satisfy increased customer demand 
we were able to recoup some  but not all  of these higher costs from increased pricing to our customers 
during  the industry experienced raw material supply disruptions caused by abnormal weather conditions during the crop growing cycle 
in a continuing effort to maintain supplies to meet customer demand for our products  we made additional market purchases at substantially higher than historical prices  with the intention of recouping these higher costs by increasing prices to our customers 
when market prices of raw products unexpectedly declined sharply in late december  we were unable to recoup all of these higher costs through continued price increases to our customers 
we expect some impact of these higher lettuce costs to continue into the first quarter of finally  in  we continued to invest in our consumer test of fresh cut fruit 
we expect these costs to continue into as we introduce this fresh cut fruit into more retail and foodservice locations 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales declined in compared to  primarily due to our acquisition of fresh express in october fresh express previously had a lower cost of goods sold ratio than our fresh cut segment 
gross profit in  gross profit increased million  or  to million 
in  gross profit increased million  or  to million from million in gross profit margin  defined as gross profit as a percentage of net sales  was in  in and in the decrease in gross profit margin in compared to was due primarily to our fresh cut segment  discussed above in cost of goods sold 
in addition  broadline segment issues discussed above in cost of goods sold  including the negative impact of issues at quality foods also contributed to our decrease in gross profit margin in compared to the increase in gross profit margin in compared to was due primarily to our acquisition of fresh express  which had higher gross profit margins than many of our other operating companies 
our increase in gross profit margin was partially offset by the acquisition of quality foods in may  which has lower gross profit margins than our other broadline companies  and by the impact of the springfield foodservice ammonia leak  both discussed above in cost of goods sold 
operating expenses consolidated 
in  operating expenses increased million  or  to million 
in  operating expenses increased million  or  to million from million in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were in  in and in the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales in compared to was due mainly to improvements in our broadline segment and decreased overhead costs in our fresh cut segment  discussed below 
these improvements were partially offset by increased estimated workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance costs in all of our business segments and increased operating expenses in our customized segment related to the labor dispute discussed below 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales in compared to was due mainly to ammonia leak costs at springfield foodservice  discussed below and our acquisition of fresh express  whi ch has higher operating expense levels than our foodservice distribution business 
at the beginning of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  we no longer record amortization expense on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  which we reported in operating expenses 
this accounting change affected our broadline and fresh cut segments 
broadline 
our broadline segment s operating expenses decreased as a percentage of sales in from  due primarily to our concentrated efforts to increase efficiencies in warehousing and transportation  partially offset by increased estimated workers compensation and vehicle liability self insurance costs 
in  operating expenses included million of costs attributable to the ammonia leak at springfield foodservice  discussed above in cost of goods sold 
broadline s operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased in compared to  due primarily to the impact of the springfield foodservice ammonia leak 
operating expenses in and  compared to  were favorably impacted by a decrease in amortization expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
 which eliminated amortization expense on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
in the first quarter of  we expect our broadline segment to experience higher operating expen ses because of start up costs related to new multi unit chain business 
customized 
our customized segment s operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased slightly in from  mainly due to increased estimated workers compensation and vehicle liability self insurance costs and costs related to the labor dispute at our elkton  maryland distribution facility 
in the fourth quarter of  certain drivers at the elkton  maryland facility went on strike 
we incurred incremental costs in the fourth quarter of to engage replacement drivers to maintain the service level to our customers  to provide additional security at the facility  and to pay our legal counsel 
we expect these costs to continue into until the dispute is resolved 
our operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased in from  mainly as the result of changes in customer mix and start up costs related to new business 
fresh cut 
our fresh cut segment s operating expenses as a percentage of sales declined in from mainly because of decreased overhead costs  partially offset by increased estimated workers compensation and vehicle liability self insurance costs 
fresh cut s operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased in compared to  due to the integration costs associated with the acquisition of fresh express and the impact of the historically higher operating expense ratio of fresh express compared to our other fresh cut operations 
reducing operating expenses in and compared to was a decrease in amortization expense due to the adoption of sfas no

the increase in operating profit margin in over is due primarily to a higher contribution from our fresh cut segment  as a result of our acquisition of fresh express in october our fresh cut segment typically has a higher operating profit margin than our foodservice distribution business 
additionally  operating profit margins were favorably impacted in and due to the adoption of sfas no

income tax expense income tax expense was million in  million in and million in as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  the provision for income taxes was  and in  and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in is the result of increased state income taxes related to acquisitions completed in previous years

liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  operating leases  normal trade credit terms and the sale of our common stock 
despite our growth in net sales  we have reduced our working capital needs by financing our investment in inventory principally with accounts payable and outstanding checks in excess of deposits 
we typically fund our acquisitions  and expect to fund future acquisitions  with our existing cash  additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt or equity securities 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at january   an increase of million from december  the increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million  partially offset by cash used in investing activities of million and cash used in financing activities of  at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million from december  the decrease was mainly due to cash used in investing activities of million  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities and financing activities of million and million  respectively

operatin g  investing and financing activities are discussed below 
operating activities during  we generated cash from operating activities of million  compared to million in and million in cash provided by operating activities for all three years was primarily due to increased sales in all of our business segments  partially offset by increased cost of goods sold and operating expenses  discussed above in results of operations

in july  we received million of proceeds from the sale of an undivided interest in our receivables under the receivables facility 
these proceeds are reflected in the change in accounts receivable on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
see off balance sheet activities below for further discussion of our receivables facility 
despite the sale of the incremental undivided interest in receivables under our receivables facility in  accounts receivable increased during by million  compared to an increase of million in the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased sales in december compared to december the increase in accounts receivable was mainly due to higher sales in december compared to december  due to acquisitions and incre ased sales from existing operations 
inventories increased during by million  compared to an increase of million in inventories increased in mainly due to increased sales volume over the prior year and the rollout of new menu items for certain customized segment customers near the end of inventories increased in over due to increased sales volume in all of our segments  new customers in our customized segment and acquisitions in our broadline segment 
deferred income taxes increased million in  compared to an increase of million in the increase in deferred income taxes in is primarily due to accelerated depreciation deductions taken on assets for tax purposes in excess of deductions for book purposes 
accrued expenses increased during by million  compared to an increase of million in the increase in accrued expenses was partially due to increased estimated self insurance costs for workers compensation  vehicle liability and group medical insurance 
see application of critical accounting policies below for further discussion of these estimates 
increased employee related costs and increased deferred revenue for marketing programs also contributed to the increase in accrued expenses in increased estimated self insurance costs for incurred but not reported claims for group medical insurance and other employee related costs contributed to the increase in accrued expenses over income taxes  net  decreased million in compared to an increase of million in the decrease in income taxes  net  was due to excess tax payments made in  primarily as a result of lower than expected taxable earnings

financing activities in  we reduced our total debt by million  of which million repaid borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  defined below 
in july  we sold an incremental undivided interest in receivables under our receivables facility  obtaining million in proceeds 
we used a portion of these proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facility 
in april  we amended and restated our credit facility  referred to as the credit facility  which  among other things  increased the facility to million from million 
the credit facility expires in and bears interest at a floating rate equal to  at our election  the agent bank s prime rate or a spread over libor 
this rate varies based upon our senior leverage ratio  which excludes subordinated debt  and is defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility has an annual commitment fee  ranging from to of the average daily unused portion of the total facility  based on our senior leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement

in  we borrowed million from our credit facility  primarily to finance our acquisitions of quality foods  middendorf meat  tpc and all kitchens 
in  our borrowings under the credit facility declined by million  mainly due to repayments we made with proceeds we received from the convertible notes issuance and the common stock offering discussed below 
also in  we paid debt issuance costs of million for the issuance of the convertible notes and for the replacement of our then existing revolving credit facility 
in october  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in the net proceeds from the issuance of the convertible notes and from our concurrent offering of common stock  discussed below  were used to repay our borrowings then outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility and to fund the acquisition of fresh express 
the convertible notes are subordinate to all existing and future senior debt and are convertible at any time until maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
we can redeem the convertible notes in whole or in part  at any time on or after october   subject to compliance with covenants contained in our credit facility 
each holder of the convertible notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued interest upon a change of control of the company  as defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes  and upon the occurrence of certain other events 
interest is payable semi annually 
we also issued million shares of our common stock in october the proceeds from this offering of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses  and proceeds from the concurrent offering of convertible notes were used to fund the acquisition of fresh express and to repay borrowings then outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility 
our associates who exercised stock options and purchased our stock under the employee stock purchase plan provided million of proceeds in  compared to million in and million in see note to our consolidated financial statements for details of our employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
checks in excess of deposits increased by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
checks in excess of deposits represent checks that we have written that are not yet cashed by the payee and in total exceed the current available cash balance at the respective bank 
the increases in checks in excess of deposits in  and are related to our efforts to improve cash management 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and the sale of undivided interests in receivables under the receivables facility  discussed below  will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
however  we will likely require additional sources of financing to the extent that we make additional acquisitions in the future 
the table below presents contractual minimum cash obligations under long term debt  capital leases  operating leases and purchase obligations as of january  long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets includes both debt and capital leases 
lease payments include payments due under our existing non cancelable operating leases 
in the table below  purchase obligations refers to specific agreements to purchase goods  which are enforceable and legally binding 
purchase obligations do not include outstanding purchase orders for inventory in the normal course of business  other than those discussed below  and do not include non cancelable service contracts 
the table does not include liabilities for deferred income taxes  which we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at january  this table should be read in conjunction with notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years and years and more than years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our fresh cut segment has contracts to purchase produce  some of which have variable quantities  with minimum and maximum limits 
our minimum commitments under produce purchase contracts totaled million at january  our fresh cut segment also had outstanding purchase orders for capital projects totaling million at january  our fresh cut segment s contracts expire at various times throughout and at january   our broadline segment had contracts to purchase products totaling million  which expire throughout these fresh cut and broadline purchase commitments are included in purchase obligations in the above table 
amounts due under these fresh cut and broadline contracts were not included on our consolidated balance sheet at january   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in addition to the above minimum cash obligations  in connection with certain acquisitions  we have entered into earnout agreements with certain of the former owners of the businesses that we have acquired 
these agreements are based upon certain net earnings and other targets  as defined in each agreement  and discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these earnout obligations  to the extent earned  are for companies acquired from to  and may include payments in cash and or shares of our common stock 
as of january   the maximum potential earnout obligation  assuming all future earnout targets are met in their earliest possible years  totaled million million in  million in and million in these contingent payments are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at january   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
if paid  these earnout payments would increase the goodwill of the companies acquired 
if the future earnout targets are not met  these maximum amounts will be lower  or we may not be required to make any payments 
we have entered into numerous operating leases  including leases for buildings  equipment  tractors and trailers 
in certain of these leases  we have provided residual value guarantees to the lessors 
at january   the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees totaled million  which would be mitigated by the fair value of the leased assets at lease expiration 
our assessment as to whether it is probable that we will be required to make payments under the terms of the guarantees is based upon our actual and expected loss experience 
these leases have expiration dates ranging from to consistent with the requirements of financial accounting standard board interpretation no 
 we have recorded  of the million of potential future payments under these guarantees on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  additionally  we do not consider payments under these guarantees  if any  reasonably likely to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
notes and to our consolidated financial statements provide further discussion of these guarantees and the related accounting and disclosure requirements 
off balance sheet activities we have a receivables facility  which is generally described as off balance sheet financing 
in addition  we had two master operating lease facilities  generally considered to be off balance sheet financing  which we terminated in june in financing activities above  we describe certain purchase obligations  earnout agreements with certain of the former owners of the businesses that we have acquired  and residual value guarantees  all of which could be considered off balance sheet items 
refer to the discussion in financing activities above and notes and to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our commitments  contingencies and leases 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing because the transaction and the financial institution s ownership interest in certain of our accounts receivable results in assets being removed from our consolidated balance sheet to the extent that the transaction qualifies for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles 
this treatment requires us to account for the transaction with the financial institution as a sale of the undivided interest in the accounts receivable instead of reflecting the financial institution s net investment of million as debt 
we believe that the receivables facility provides us with additional liquidity at a very competitive cost compared to other forms of financing 
in july  we entered into the receivables facility  under which pfg receivables corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose subsidiary  sold an undivided interest in certain of our trade receivables 
pfg receivables corporation was formed for the sole purpose of buying receivables generated by certain of our operating units and selling an undivided interest in those receivables to a financial institution 
under the receivables facility  certain of our operating units sell a portion of their accounts receivable to pfg receivables corporation  which in turn  subject to certain conditions  may from time to time sell an undivided interest in these receivables to the financial institution 
our operating units continue to service the receivables on behalf of the financial institution at estimated market rates 
accordingly  we have not recognized a servicing asset or liability 
we received million of proceeds from the sale of the undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility in in june  we extended the term of the receivables facility through june   and increased the amount of the undivided interest in the receivables that can be owned by the financial institution to million 
in july  we sold an incremental undivided interest in receivables under the receivables facility and received an additional million in proceeds 
we used these proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facility and to fund working capital needs 
if the receivables facility terminates  either at its scheduled termination date or upon the occurrence of specified events similar to events of default  payments on accounts receivable sold would be remitted to the financial institution in an amount equal to the institution s undivided interest 
at january   securitized accounts receivable totaled million  including million sold to the financial institution and derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet 
total securitized accounts receivable includes our residual interest in accounts receivable of million 
at december   securitized accounts receivable totaled million  including million sold to the financial institution and derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet  and including the residual interest of million 
the residual interest represents our retained interest in receivables held by pfg receivables corporation 
we measure the residual interest using the estimated discounted cash flows of the underlying accounts receivable  based on estimated collections and a discount rate approximately equivalent to our incremental borrowing rate 
the loss on sale of the undivided interest in receivables of million in and and million in  is incl uded in other expense  net  in our consolidated statements of earnings and represents our cost of securitizing those receivables with the financial institution 
we record the sale of the undivided interest in accounts receivable to the financial institution according to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
accordingly  at the time the undivided interest in receivables is sold  the receivables are removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a loss on the sale of the undivided interest in these receivables  which includes a discount  based upon the receivables credit quality and a financing cost for the financial institution  based upon a day commercial paper rate 
at january   the rate under the receivables facility was per annum 
in june  we terminated our two master operating lease facilities 
in june  the lessor sold two of the three distribution centers included in the first master operating lease facility the first facility to third parties unaffiliated with us 
we concurrently entered into operating leases with those unaffiliated third parties for these distribution centers 
the operating leases have initial terms of years  plus five renewal options of five years each 
the future minimum lease payments for these leases are included in the above table of contractual obligations 
in addition  we purchased the remaining distribution center in the first facility from the lessor for million 
this distribution center is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at january  in our customized segment 
in june  the lessor sold one of the distribution centers and the office building included in our other master operating lease facility the second facility to third parties unaffiliated with us 
we also sold land and a building under construction to a third party unaffiliated with us 
we concurrently entered into operating leases with those unaffiliated third parties for all of these properties 
the operating leases have initial terms of years  plus five renewal options of five years each 
the future minimum lease payments for these leases are included in the above table of contractual obligations 
in addition  we purchased the remaining distribution center in the second facility from the lessor for million 
this distribution center is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at january  in our broadline segment 
business combinations in  we paid million to the former shareholders of fresh express 
these payments were for certain contractual obligations and associated taxes related to the purchase of fresh express  which we acquired in also in  we paid million and issued approximately  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately  related to contractual obligations in the purchase agreements for all kitchens  tpc  carroll county foods and other companies acquired 
we acquired all kitchens and tpc in and carroll county foods in we recorded these earnout payments as additional purchase price  with the corresponding increases in goodwill 
in october  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  known as progroup  acquired all of the assets of all kitchens  a privately owned procurement and merchandising firm based in boise  idaho 
all kitchens provides procurement and merchandising services to its distributors 
we believe that this acquisition increases our services to existing progroup and all kitchens distributors  and expands our geographic base of independent foodservice distributors 
we paid million in cash for all kitchens  and assumed million of trade payables and accrued expenses with the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  we will be required to pay the prior owner of the acquired assets up to million in cash  if certain affiliate distributor targets are achieved through september we will record and have recorded these earnout payments as additional price resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
in july  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of tpc  a privately owned  broadline foodservice distributor based in rock island  illinois 
tpc services customers located throughout the states of illinois  indiana  iowa and wisconsin  including the major metropolitan area of chicago 
we believe that our acquisition of tpc extends our broadline service area in the midwest region 
we paid million for the acquisition of tpc  consisting of million in cash and common stock valued at million 
the purchase price included the repayment of outstanding debt 
we also assumed million of trade payables and accrued expenses with the acquisition of tpc 
in recording the acquisition  we valued the approximately  common shares issued based on the measurement criteria in emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf no 
 determination of the measurement date for the market price of acquirer securities issued in a purchase business combination 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an earnout agreement whereby we will be required to pay the former shareholders of tpc up to million  consisting of cash and additional common shares  if tpc achieves certain targeted levels of growth in sales and operating profit margin  as defined  through july we will record and have recorded these earnout payments as additional purchase price  resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
in july  we also acquired all of the outstanding common stock of middendorf meat  a privately owned  broadline foodservice distributor based in st 
louis  missouri  through the merger of middendorf meat with a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
middendorf meat distributes custom cut steaks and other foodservice items to independent restaurants  private clubs  hotels and other foodservice establishments in st 
louis and surrounding areas 
we believe that our acquisition of middendorf meat extends our service area to a region that is geographically contiguous to our other broadline businesses 
we paid million for the acquisition of middendorf meat  consisting of million in cash and common stock valued at million 
the purchase price included the repayment of a portion of middendorf meat s outstanding debt 
we also assumed million in trade payables  accrued expenses  deferred taxes and debt with the acquisition of middendorf meat 
in the second quarter of  we finalized the purchase price of middendorf meat  resulting in the return of million in cash and million in our common stock from the former owners of middendorf meat  related to the closing net worth adjustment and certain related claims 
we recorded this adjustment to the purchase price as a reduction of goodwill 
in recording the acquisition  we valued the approximately  common shares issued  net  based on the measurement criteria of eitf no 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an earnout agreement whereby we will be required to pay the former shareholders of middendorf meat up to million  consisting of cash and additional common shares  if middendorf meat achieves certain targeted levels of growth in operating profit  as defined  over a period of up to six years following the acquisition 
we will record any earnout payments as additional purchase price  resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
in may  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of quality foods  a privately owned  broadline foodservice distributor based in little rock  arkansas  with distribution centers in little rock  and batesville and magee  mississippi 
quality foods provides products and services to traditional foodservice accounts in a region covering arkansas  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  oklahoma  tennessee and texas 
we believe that our acquisition of quality foods extends our service area to a region that is geographically contiguous to our other broadline businesses 
we paid million  net of cash acquired  for quality foods 
the purchase price included the repayment of outstanding debt 
we also assumed million of trade payables and accrued expenses with the acquisition of quality foods 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an earnout agreement whereby we will be required to pay the former shareholders of quality foods up to million in cash if quality foods achieves certain targeted levels of growth in operating profit  as defined  over a three year period following the acquisition 
we will record any earnout payments as additional purchase price  resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
also in  we paid a total of million in cash and issued approximately  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately  to the former shareholders of carroll county foods and afflink  which were acquired in and  respectively  as a result of certain contractual obligations in the purchase agreements relating to those acquisitions 
we have recorded these earnout payments as additional purchase price  resulting in corresponding increases in goodwill 
in october  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of fresh express  a fresh cut produce processor and distributor 
we paid million  net of cash acquired  for fresh express 
the purchase price included the repayment of outstanding debt 
we also assumed million of trade payables  accrued expenses  deferred taxes and other liabilities with our acquisition of fresh express 
as discussed above  in  we paid million in cash to the former shareholders of fresh express for certain contractual obligations and associated taxes related to the purchase of fresh express 
in connection with the acquisition of fresh express  we adopted a plan for integration of the business 
we originally established an accrual of million as part of the initial allocation of the purchase price of fresh express  to provide for certain costs of this plan 
the plan was to combine the franklin park  illinois and the chicago  illinois  processing plants into one facility  convert the greencastle  pennsylvania  and the chicago facilities into distribution centers  dispose of certain processing equipment at the chicago and greencastle plants and eliminate approximately processing related jobs at the affected facilities 
in  we reduced our accrual for the integration plan by million  with a corresponding decrease in fresh express goodwill 
we made these adjustments primarily as a result of the finalization of the greencastle and chicago integration plans 
in addition  we decided not to dispose of certain leased office buildings in salinas  california  as originally planned 
in the first quarter of  we converted the greencastle facility into a distribution center and eliminated approximately processing related jobs at that facility 
in the second quarter of  we decided not to convert the chicago facility into a distribution center and will continue to use it for processing 
therefore  in the second quarter of  we reduced our accrual for the integratio n plan by an additional million  with a corresponding decrease in fresh express goodwill 
in the third quarter of  we completed the integration plan 
through january   million of employee separation costs and million of professional fees  lease and related costs and dismantling costs have been charged against the accrual 
in september  we acquired all the outstanding common stock of springfield foodservice  a privately owned  broadline foodservice distributor based in springfield  massachusetts

we will record any earnout payments as additional purchase price  resulting in a corresponding increase in goodwill 
in april  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of empire seafood  a privately owned distributor and processor of seafood 
we paid million for empire seafood  consisting of million in cash  net of cash acquired  and approximately  shares of our common stock  valued at million

we recorded these earnout payments as additional purchase price  resulting in corresponding increases in goodwill 
application of critical accounting policies we have prepared our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
in preparing our financial statements  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting periods 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  consequently  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare our financial statements 
management s estimates are generally based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we determine to be reasonable in light of the relevant facts and circumstances 
we believe that our critical accounting estimates include goodwill and other intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  incurred but not repo rted insurance claims  reserve for inventories  sales incentives  vendor rebates and other promotional incentives and income taxes 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
our goodwill and other intangible assets include the cost of acquired subsidiaries in excess of the fair value of the tangible net assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
other intangible assets include customer relationships  trade names  trademarks  patents and non compete agreements 
we use estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assigning lives to acquired intangibles and evaluating those assets for impairment after acquisition 
these estimates and assumptions include indicators that would trigger an impairment of assets  whether those indicators are temporary  economic or competitive factors that affect valuation  discount rates and cash flow estimates 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable  or the estimated lives assigned to such assets are improper  we must reduce the carrying value of the assets to the net realizable value or adj ust the amortization period of the asset  recording any adjustment in our consolidated statements of earnings 
sfas no 
was effective at the beginning of  except for goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations completed subsequent to june   for which the standard was effective beginning july  in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives as of the beginning of sfas no 
requires us to assess goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
sfas no 
requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
if we determine the fair values of our reporting units are less than the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives on our balance sheet for that reporting unit  we must recognize an impairment loss in our financial statements 
as of january   our unamortized goodwill wa s million and other intangible assets totaled million  net 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for our broadline and fresh cut segments  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
our customized segment has no goodwill or other intangible assets 
we concluded that no impairment existed 
in testing for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units based upon discounting future operating cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
a change in our estimates of projected future operating cash flows or discount rate used in our calculation of the fair value of each reporting unit would have no impact on the reported value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  we report intangible assets with definite lives at cost less accumulated amortization 
we compute amortization over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally three to forty years 
we test these intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular asset may not be recoverable  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in order to evaluate the recoverability of an asset  we compare the carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if we determine that the estimated  undiscounted future cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying amount on our consolidated balance sheet  we must record an impairment loss in our financial statements 
in and  we recorded no impairment loss for intangible assets with definite lives 
due to the numerous variables assoc iated with our judgments and assumptions related to the valuation of the reporting units and intangible assets with definite lives  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty 
therefore  as we become aware of additional information  we may change our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze our significant customer accounts  and when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible 
we also record reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  we may need to adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables 
in  and  we wrote off uncollectible accounts receivable of million  million and million  respectively  against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in  and  we recorded estimates of million  million and million  respectively  in operating expenses to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
incurred but not reported insurance claims 
we maintain a self insurance program covering portions of our general and vehicle liability  workers compensation and group medical insurance 
the amounts in excess of the self insured levels are fully insured  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
we accrue an estimated liability for these self insured programs  including an estimate for incurred but not reported claims  based on known claims and past claims history 
these accruals are included in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets 
the provisions for insurance claims include estimates of the frequency and timing of claim occurrences  as well as the ultimate amounts to be paid 
the accounting estimate related to incurred but not reported insurance claims is highly susceptible to change from period to period if claims differ from past claims history  which could have a material impact on our financial position and result s of operations 
for example  in  increased estimated workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance costs negatively affected our financial position and results of operations 
if we experience claims in excess of our estimates by  our insurance expense and related insurance liability would increase by million  negatively affecting our consolidated financial statements 
reserve for inventories 
we maintain reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories 
these reserves are based upon inventory category  inventory age  specifically identified inventory items and overall economic conditions 
a sudden and unexpected change in consumer preferences could result in a significant change in the reserve balance and a corresponding charge to earnings 
sales incentives 
we  primarily through our fresh cut segment  offer sales incentives and promotions to our customers resellers and to consumers 
these incentives primarily include volume and growth rebates  exclusivity and placement fees fees paid to retailers for product display  consumer coupons and promotional discounts 
we follow the requirements of eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
consideration given to customers and consumers related to sales incentives is recorded as a reduction of sales 
we treat changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be paid as changes in estimates and recognize them in the period of change 
we systematically and rationally allocate the cost of volume and growth rebates and exclusivity and placement fees to each of the underlying revenue transactions that resulted in progress by the customer toward earning the incentives 
if we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of future incentives  we record the maximum potential amount 
we use a customer s prior purchasing volume and other factors to assist us in estimating the total incentives to be paid  if any 
we record promotional discounts primarily as a reduction to the customer s invoice for goods purchased based on an underlying agreement with the customer 
we record the cost of consumer coupons at the later of the date that we offer the coupon or the date we recognize the related revenue 
in recording coupon expense  we estimate the amount of refunds or rebates that will be redeemed by consumers 
we primarily use historical coupon redemption data and forecasted sales volumes to estimate the amount to be redeemed 
if we cannot reasonably and reliably estimate this amount  we record the maximum potential amount 
we believe that the estimates we have recorded for volume and growth rebates  exclusivity and placement fees and coupon allowances are reasonable and appropriate  based on facts and circumstances known at the time we recorded the estimates 
a significant change in customer purchase volumes  coupon redemption rates or consumer purchase volumes  among other factors  could result in a significant change in our net sales and earnings 
vendor rebates and other promotional incentives 
we participate in various rebate and promotional incentives with our suppliers  including volume and growth rebates  annual and multi year incentives and promotional programs 
in  we adopted eitf no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we generally record consideration received under these incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
however  in certain circumstances  we record the consideration as a reduction of costs that we incur 
we may receive consideration in the form of cash and or invoice deductions 
we treat changes in the estimated amount of incentives to be received as changes in estimates and recognize them in the period of change 
we record consideration that we receive for incentives containing volume and growth rebates and annual and multi year incentives as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
we systematically and rationally allocate the consideration for these incentives to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by us toward earning the incentives 
if the incentives are not probable and reasonably estimable  we record the incentives as the underlying objectives or milestones are achieved 
we record annual and multi year incentives when we earn them  generally over the agreement period 
we estimate whether we will achieve the underlying objectives or milestones using current and historical purchasing data  forecasted purchasing volumes and other factors 
we record consideration received to promote and sell the supplier s products as a reduction of our costs  as the consideration is typically a reimbursement of costs incurred by us 
if we receive consideration from the suppliers in exces s of our costs  we record any excess as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
in july  the eitf reached a tentative conclusion on eitf no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
eitf no 
is discussed below in recently issued accounting pronouncements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we must make judgments in determining our provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transaction 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
at january  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes 
the net operating loss carryforwards at january  expire in years through additionally  at january   we had certain state income tax credit carryforwards  which expire in years through at december   we had no state income tax credit carryforwards 
our realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income 
we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we project future taxable income and consider prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years  we would record valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding charge to net earnings 
based on our evaluation  we expect that we will fully realize our deferred tax assets  therefore  we have not recorded any valuation allowances 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the above disclosure 
our financial statements contain other items that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
these include our calculations for bonus accruals  depreciation and amortization 
changes in estimates and assumptions used in these and other items could have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the eitf reached a tentative conclusion on eitf no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers 
eitf no 
states that certain sales incentive arrangements are not subject to the guidance in eitf no 
eitf no 
also requires disclosure of the accounting policy with respect to vendors sales incentive arrangements 
eitf no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement  but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
rescinds portions of sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we applied the provisions of sab no 
in  which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
quarterly results and seasonality set forth below is certain summary information with respect to our operations for the most recent eight fiscal quarters 
all of the fiscal quarters set forth below had weeks  except for the fourth quarter of  which had weeks 
historically  the restaurant and foodservice business is seasonal  with lower sales in the first quarter 
consequently  we may experience lower net sales during the first quarter  depending on the timing of any future acquisitions 
management believes our quarterly net sales will continue to be impacted by the seasonality of the restaurant business 
in addition  our fresh cut segment experiences some seasonality  primarily due to changes in raw material costs  as product is grown in different regions of the country in certain times of the year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are related to fluctuations in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 
our primary interest rate risk is from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt 
we currently manage this risk through a combination of fixed and floating rates on these obligations 
as of january   our total debt consisted of fixed and floating rate debt of million and million  respectively 
in addition  our receivables facility has a floating rate 
substantially all of our floating rates are based on libor with the exception of the rate on the receivables facility  which is based upon a day commercial paper rate 
a basis point increase in market interest rates on all of our floating rate debt and our receivables facility would result in a decrease in net earnings and cash flows of approximately million per annum  holding other variables constant 
significant commodity price fluctuations for certain commodities that we purchase  particularly for lettuce  could have a material impact on our results of operations 
in an attempt to manage our commodity price risk  our fresh cut segment  in the normal course of business  enters into contracts to purchase pre established quantities of various types of produce  particularly lettuce  at contracted prices based on our expected needs 
to a lesser extent  our broadline segment also enters into contracts to purchase pre established quantities of products in the normal course of business 
commitments that we have entered into to purchase produce and other products in our fresh cut and broadline segments as of january   are included in the table of contractual obligations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities in this form k 
in the case of produce  in the event that the amount of produce that we have contracted to purchase is not sufficient to meet our needs  either because of unexpected demand for our products  or as a result of disruptions in supply for instance  due to weather or disease  we will be required to purchase additional produce to meet our needs on the open market at prices that may be significantly higher than our contracted prices 
alternatively  we may need to enter into contracts to meet our forecasted needs during times of elevated market prices 
if the market prices subsequently decline  we are still required to pay the contracted price for the contracted amounts of produce
