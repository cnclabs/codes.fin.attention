item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company designs  manufactures  and markets institutional furniture 
the company s current product lines consist of multipurpose room furniture and healthcare seating 
in addition  the company continues to pursue development of new products and the acquisitions of product lines or companies that will be complementary to the company s businesses 
multipurpose room furniture 
the company s multipurpose room furniture line consists of lightweight  durable  folding leg tables  stacking chairs  folding chairs  lecterns  portable partitions  and other related products 
these products are used in multipurpose rooms of educational  recreational  hotel and hospitality  government  office  healthcare  religious and other public assembly facilities 
historically  growth in this segment has come from an expanding base of new customers  from increasing sales to existing customers and from expansion of the company s multipurpose room product line 
the current and future growth of the company s multipurpose room furniture operations is largely dependent upon its ability to successfully introduce and market new product lines of multipurpose room furniture and its ability to profitably increase its market penetration into existing and new markets 
multipurpose room furniture outlook 
the downturn in the domestic and international economy  particularly the downturn in the furniture industry and some of the company s target markets such as education and recreation  negatively impacted the company s historical sales growth rates in fiscal and continued terror threats and military conflicts have also negatively impacted many of the company s markets  particularly travel related markets such as the hotel and hospitality  recreational and public assembly markets 
industry analysts reported a decline in the us office furniture market of percent for calendar year and over percent for calendar year the company has also seen significant competitive pressure in its multipurpose room table markets from lower priced thermo formed and blow molded tables and expects this pressure to continue 
the company s multipurpose room operations for the year ended march  performed better than the industry as sales volumes increased percent as compared to the prior year 
this increase was particularly strong in the fourth quarter with sales volumes increasing by percent as compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
for the current calendar year  industry analysts recently revised their estimates of growth in the us office furniture upward from percent to percent  with the first quarter flat and improving as the year progresses 
the company is encouraged by these forecasts as well as the strengthening of the economy in general  and is cautiously optimistic that the industry will begin to rebound and that the company s multipurpose room sales volumes will likewise continue to grow 
the company is preparing to launch its next generation of multipurpose room tables 
during the past few years  the company has been developing a table that is stronger  lighter  more durable and better able to withstand outdoor use than its current multipurpose room tables 
the company believes that it has developed a product that will meet most if not all of these requirements 
during the quarter ended september   the company shipped some initial prototype tables to one of its customers 
upon further consultation with this customer as well as further internal testing  the company initiated some revisions in the design of the table requiring some rework of the initial design and manufacturing process 
the company has completed the redesign and is beginning to create a repeatable manufacturing process to produce these tables 
the company also has completed the construction of a  square foot facility that is now being used to manufacture its new generation tables 
the company has started regular table shipments to certain customers  and anticipates moving forward with a general product launch in the next six to nine months 
the company currently believes that its next generation table will largely replace its existing table sales over a period of one to two years 
the company also believes that if all of the performance criteria are met that it may be able to capture additional market share 
during the past few years  chair sales have begun to make up a larger portion of the sales of the company s multipurpose room operations 
although table sales still predominate the volume of this operation  most of the increases in sales can be attributed to increases in chair sales 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company launched a new line of stacking chairs to complement its existing chair lines 
the company anticipates developing additional complementary chair lines to continue to grow this portion of its business as well as further penetrating its existing marketplace with its current line of chairs 
however  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to successfully develop and launch such chair lines or further penetrate its existing marketplace 
the company has a percent equity ownership interest in a separate startup development company that is investigating the commercial development of a new technology related to the manufacturing process the company is using for its next generation tables 
the company believes that this technology may be used for the internal development and or licensing of new products which may be outside of its current multipurpose room marketplace 
pending the launch of the company s next generation table  the company will continue to evaluate potential applications of this process to determine which new products  if any  would be best suited for the company to start developing 
there is no guarantee that the company will be able to find other suitable applications for this technology 
on april   the company purchased the assets of versipanel llc  a privately owned designer  manufacturer and marketer of a variety of portable partitions based in phoenix  arizona 
for the year ended december   versipanel generated sales of approximately million 
the company plans to sell the versipanel products through its existing sales system to current customers 
the company believes that this product will allow it to expand its product line and better penetrate the institutional furniture market 
healthcare seating 
through broda  the company markets a line of healthcare seating products to customers in canada and the united states 
broda s operations are based in waterloo  ontario  canada 
broda focuses on providing products which assist long term care patients with advanced needs due to a debilitating condition or disease  and has developed a line of premium priced geriatric seating products 
broda chairs are serving a very specific niche in the healthcare market and thus are not competing in the commodity oriented general healthcare seating market 
healthcare seating outlook 
the company believes that the specialty healthcare seating market is less subject to economic pressures than the company s multipurpose room furniture operations 
during the year ended march   the company s healthcare seating operations have not been significantly impacted by the downturn in the us and world economies 
however  the medical and healthcare industry is more subject to regulatory changes that could affect the demand for broda s products 
the company is not aware of any regulatory changes in the near future that would have a substantial and negative impact on this business 
the company s healthcare seating operation s future growth depends largely upon increasing its market penetration into the us market and other foreign markets as well as its ability to successfully introduce new product lines 
general near term outlook 
based on the reasons stated above  the company anticipates that sales volumes during the quarter ending june  will be up to percent higher as compared to the prior year s first quarter 
despite these expectations  the company  for a variety of reasons including those described in risk factors that may affect future operations  may not be successful in achieving this sales level in the first quarter

critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and footnotes 
the critical accounting policies for the company which require management to make judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time of the estimate include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the reserve for obsolete inventory  accruals for warranty expense  values for the discontinued operations  goodwill and other intangible assets  notes receivable  income taxes  pension liability and wage dispute  and revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company exercises considerable judgment in determining the ultimate collectability of its accounts receivable 
several factors are used in making these judgments including the customer credit quality  historical write off experience and current economic trends 
the company reviews these factors quarterly  and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  an additional allowance may be required

the company regularly assesses the adequacy of its accrual for warranty expense based upon historical warranty rates and anticipated future warranty rates 
values for the discontinued operations on november   the company completed its plan for exiting and selling the assets of the specialty office seating and systems segment of its business 
this plan was originally approved by the company s board of directors on june  during the quarter ended june   the company developed and approved a plan for exiting and selling the specialty office seating and systems furniture segment of its operations 
since that time and in accordance with apb  the company has treated the do group and centercore segment of its operations as a discontinued operation 
at the time that the plan was originally formulated  an estimated  loss was accrued for in the three months ended june  to account for the expected losses on disposal and estimated operating losses through the disposal date 
after the completion of the plan  the actual net loss  after tax has been determined to be  since the amount of loss that was originally estimated and accrued for in the june quarter of  was higher than this amount  the company recognized a gain  net of tax  of  in the period ended december  the company did retain certain assets and liabilities of the segment after completion of the sales plan 
considerable judgment was used to estimate the value of these assets and liabilities based on many factors including the net expected realizable value of the remaining accounts receivable  the realization of tax benefits  and potential remaining expenses 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company reviews annually the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill arose from the broda acquisition and the other intangible asset is intellectual property related to the startup development company in which the company has invested 
this review is performed by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
no impairment charges have been recorded related to the broda goodwill or the intellectual property related to the startup development company 
notes receivable the company reviews its notes receivable to determine likely collectability 
since the notes are with entities without a history of an ability to create future cash flows  the company bases its belief in their collectability upon its understanding of the potential future success of the products being developed or on the company s belief of what the liquidation value of the operation would be 
at this time  the company has created reserves on some of these notes receivable 
due to the high level of uncertainty in the success of these products  these notes receivable may not be ultimately realized

pension liability and wage dispute the company has certain alleged obligations of up to million related to a defined benefit pension plan and million related to a wage dispute resulting from exiting and selling its specialty office seating and systems business 
the company does not believe that it is liable for these amounts and plans to vigorously defend its positions 
at this time  the company is unable to determine what its liability will be 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  as revised by sab no 
sales are recorded when title passes and collectability is reasonably assured under its various shipping terms 
revenue is normally recognized upon shipment of goods to customers
