item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview since its inception in november  biotime has been engaged primarily in research and development activities  which have culminated in the commercial launch of hextend  our lead product  and a clinical trial of pentalyte 
our operating revenues have been generated primarily from licensing fees  including  received from abbott laboratories for the right to manufacture and market hextend in the united states and canada 
as a result of the developmental nature of our business and the limited sales of our products  since biotime s inception in november we have incurred  of losses 
our ability to generate substantial operating revenue depends upon our success in developing and marketing or licensing our plasma volume expanders and organ preservation solutions and technology for medical use 
most of our research and development efforts have been devoted to our first three blood volume replacement products hextend  pentalyte  and hetacool 
by testing and bringing all three products to the market  we can increase our market share by providing the medical community with solutions to match patients needs 
by developing technology for the use of hetacool in low temperature surgery  trauma care  and organ transplant surgery  we may also create new market segments for our product line 
our first product  hextend  is a physiologically balanced blood plasma volume expander  for the treatment of hypovolemia 
abbott has an exclusive license to sell hextend in the united states and canada  and also has a right to obtain licenses to manufacture and sell other biotime products 
under our license agreement  abbott will report sales of hextend and pay us the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place  as we do not have sufficient sales history to accurately predict quarterly sales 
hextend sales are still in the ramp up phase 
royalties on sales that occurred during the third quarter of through the third quarter of are reflected in our financial statements for the year ended december  revenues from the abbott license agreement for the year ended december  were  royalties of  on sales that occurred during the fourth quarter of will be reflected in our financial statements for the first quarter of 
table of contents the following graph illustrates the increase in our annual revenues from royalties and license fees for the years indicated 
for the years  and  revenues consist of payments received under the abbott license agreement 
for  revenues include payments received under the abbott license agreement and license fees of  from cj corp 
that were recognized in bar chart hextend has become the standard plasma volume expander at a number of prominent teaching hospitals and leading medical centers 
biotime believes that as hextend use proliferates within the leading us hospitals  other smaller hospitals will follow their lead and accelerate sales growth 
we have completed a phase i clinical trial of pentalyte and we are planning the next phase of clinical trials in which pentalyte will be used to treat hypovolemia in surgery 
we have spent approximately  in direct costs through december  developing pentalyte 
our ability to commence and complete additional clinical studies of pentalyte depends on our cash resources and the costs involved  which are not presently determinable 
clinical trials of pentalyte in 
table of contents the united states may take longer and may be more costly than the hextend clinical trials  which cost approximately  the fda permitted us to proceed directly into a phase iii clinical trial of hextend involving only patients because the active ingredients in hextend had already been approved for use in plasma expanders by the fda in other products 
because pentalyte contains a starch pentastarch that has not been approved by the fda for use in a plasma volume expander although pentastarch is approved in the us for use in certain intravenous solutions used to collect certain blood cell fractions  we had to complete a phase i clinical trial of pentalyte  and we may have to complete a phase ii clinical trial in addition to a phase iii trial or a combined phase ii iii trial  that will involve more patients than the hextend trials 
we estimate that a phase ii trial could be undertaken for approximately  but we do not know yet the actual scope or cost of the clinical trials that the fda will require for pentalyte or the other products we are developing 
plasma volume expanders containing pentastarch have been approved for use in certain foreign countries including canada and those of the european union and japan 
the regulatory agencies in those countries may be more willing to accept applications for regulatory approval of pentalyte based upon clinical trials smaller in scope than those that may be required by the fda 
this would permit us to bring pentalyte to market overseas more quickly than in the united states  provided that suitable licensing arrangements can be made with multinational or foreign pharmaceutical companies to obtain financing for clinical trials and manufacturing and marketing arrangements 
we are also continuing to develop solutions for low temperature surgery 
once a sufficient amount of data from successful low temperature surgery has been compiled  we plan to seek permission to use hextend as a complete replacement for blood under near freezing conditions 
we currently plan to market hextend for complete blood volume replacement at very low temperatures under the registered trademark hetacool after fda approval is obtained 
in february  we launched a research program using hetacool in animal models of trauma at the state university of new york health science center in brooklyn 
preliminary laboratory results there have already supported the feasibility of using hetacool to treat subjects following severe hemorrhage 
the use of hetacool at near freezing temperatures also will be studied in animal models of cardiovascular surgery at the texas heart institute in houston 
the project has been approved by the appropriate internal committees  and is awaiting the beginning of experimentation 
we spent approximately  through december  developing hetacool 
these costs do not include the cost of developing hextend  upon which hetacool is based 
biotime scientists believe the hetacool program has the potential to produce a product that could be used in very high fluid volumes liters or more per procedure if hetacool were used as an multi organ donor preservation solution or to temporarily replace substantially all of the patient s circulating blood volume in cardiovascular surgery  trauma treatment  and organ transplantation 
however  the cost and time to complete the development of hetacool  including clinical trials  cannot presently be determined 

table of contents until such time as we are able to complete the development of pentalyte and hetacool and enter into commercial license agreements for those products and foreign commercial license agreements for hextend  we will depend upon royalties from the sale of hextend by abbott laboratories  and from cj once product sales commence in korea  as our principal source of revenues 
abbott has an option to obtain a license to market pentalyte and hetacool in the united states and canada  and we would receive additional license fees if those options are exercised  in addition to royalties on subsequent sales of those products 
we are discussing potential manufacturing  distributing  and marketing agreements with certain pharmaceutical companies for our products in the rest of the world 
the amount and pace of research and development work that we can do or sponsor  and our ability to commence and complete clinical trials required to obtain fda and foreign regulatory approval of products  depends upon the amount of money we have 
future research and clinical study costs are not presently determinable due to many factors  including the inherent uncertainty of these costs and the uncertainty as to timing  source  and amount of capital that will become available for these projects 
we have already curtailed the pace of our product development efforts due to the limited amount of funds available  and we may have to postpone further laboratory and clinical studies  unless our cash resources increase through growth in revenues  the completion of licensing agreements  additional equity investment  borrowing or third party sponsorship 
because our research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  and production and marketing expenses will be charged against earnings for financial reporting purposes  management expects that there will be losses from operations from time to time during the near future 
hextend  pentalyte  and hetacool are registered trademarks of biotime 
results of operations year ended december  and year ended december  for the year ended december   we recognized  of royalty revenues  compared with  recognized for the year ended december  this increase in royalties is attributable to an increase in product sales by abbott 
under our license agreement  abbott reports sales of hextend and pays us the royalties and license fees due on account of such sales within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we recognize such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales took place  as we do not have sufficient sales history to accurately predict quarterly sales 
for example  royalties on sales made during the fourth quarter of will not be recognized until the first quarter of fiscal year during  we recognized  of license fees from cj 
we were actually paid a total of  less  of korean taxes withheld and a  finder s fee to a third party  but since completion dates for certain milestones that the license fees from cj are tied to remain 
table of contents uncertain  the license fee has been deferred  and will be recognized as revenue over the life of the contract  which has been estimated to be approximately eight years based on the current expected life of the governing patent covering our products in korea 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december   down from  for the year ended december  the decrease is chiefly attributable to a significant decrease in research and development salaries and payroll taxes allocated to research and development of  after a reexamination of payroll categorizations for all employees led to an overall update in which there was a net shift of allocations from research and development to general and administrative  and a decrease in insurance costs allocated to research and development of  research and development expenses include laboratory study expenses  salaries  preparation of regulatory applications in the united states and europe  manufacturing of solution for trials  and consultants fees 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase as we commence new clinical studies of pentalyte 
general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses include salaries allocated to general and administrative accounts  scientific consulting fees  expenditures for patent costs  trademark expenses  insurance costs allocated to general and administrative expenses  stock exchange related costs  depreciation expense  shipping expenses  and other miscellaneous expenses 
our interest expense increased by  during due to amortization of new costs incurred during associated with the warrants issued to certain of our debenture holders in exchange for the right to make scheduled interest payments in shares of biotime stock 
ultimately  we did not exercise these rights 
for the year ended december   other income increased to  from  for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to  of non recurring insurance benefit received under a key man life insurance policy following the death of chairman and ceo paul segall 
year ended december  and year ended december  for the year ended december   we recognized  of royalty revenues  compared with  recognized for the year ended december  this increase in royalties is attributable to an increase in product sales by abbott 
we also received a reimbursement of  from abbott for regulatory fees incurred by us 
for the year ended december   interest and other income decreased to  from  for the year ended december  the decrease is attributable to lower interest rates and cash balances for  versus research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december   down from  for the year ended december  the decrease is chiefly 
table of contents attributable to a significant decrease in fees paid to scientific consultants of  a decrease in expenses for laboratory equipment of  and a decrease in research and development salaries of  research and development expenses include laboratory study expenses  european clinical trial expenses  salaries  preparation of additional regulatory applications in the united states and europe  manufacturing of solution for trials  and consultants fees 
it is expected that research and development expenses will increase if we obtain sufficient capital to commence new clinical studies of our products in the united states and europe 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is chiefly attributable to a decrease of  in expenditures for our annual report and annual meeting  a decrease in general and administrative consulting of  a decrease in investor public relations of  a decrease in meeting costs of  a decrease in spending for office supplies and expenses of  a decrease in telephone expenses of  a decrease in travel expenses of  and a decrease in general and administrative salaries of  our interest expense increased by  during because we incurred interest expense related to our debentures for all of  whereas we only incurred approximately five months of interest expense during in relation to the debentures  which were issued in august taxes at december  we had a cumulative net operating loss carryforward of approximately  for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  licensing fees  and borrowings 
during january  we completed a subscription rights offer the rights offer through which we raised  through the sale of  common shares and  warrants 
following the completion of the rights offer  we raised an additional  by selling an additional  common shares and  warrants under a standby purchase agreement to certain persons who acted as guarantors of the rights offer 
the common shares and warrants were sold as units for per unit 
each unit consisted of one common share and one half of a warrant 
each full warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one common share for per share and will expire on january  we may redeem the warrants by paying 
per warrant if the closing price of the common shares on the amex or any other national securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market exceeds of the exercise price of the warrants for any consecutive trading days 
during february  we eliminated  of debenture indebtedness by using a portion of the proceeds of the rights offer to repay  of debentures in cash  and by issuing a total of  common shares and  common share purchase warrants in exchange for  of debentures held by certain persons who acted as participating debenture holders under the standby purchase agreement 
negative working capital at december  of 
table of contents  included a liability of  net of a discount of  due to the debentures 
however  as a result of the cash raised and the conversion of the debentures  we now have positive working capital 
in consideration for their agreement to purchase up to  of units if the subscription rights were not fully exercised  under the standby purchase agreement we paid the guarantors  in cash and issued to them warrants to purchase  common shares  and we paid the participating debenture holders  in cash and issued to them warrants to purchase  common shares 
the warrants issued to the guarantors and participating debenture holders have the same terms as the warrants we sold in the rights offer 
at our current rate of spending  our cash on hand  including  we had on december  and funds received during january and february  plus license fees receivable  and anticipated royalties from abbott  will last approximately months 
during april  we received the initial  license fee payment  less  of korean taxes withheld  from cj under the cj agreement 
we paid a finder s fee of  from the proceeds 
a second installment of  will be payable by cj days after it submits an application for regulatory approval of hextend in south korea 
on august   biotime completed a private placement of  common shares for   net proceeds after cash placement fees of  through ladenburg thalmann co 
inc we have registered these shares for sale under the securities act of  as amended 
in connection with the offering  and in addition to the placement fees referred to above  we granted to ladenburg thalmann co 
inc  warrants to purchase  common shares at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants expire on august  during august  we received cash and converted debt totaling  through the sale of our series a debentures to a group of private investors  including alfred d 
kingsley  a biotime shareholder and consultant  who purchased  of debentures  and milton dresner  a biotime director 
mr 
kingsley s investment included the conversion of the  principal balance of a line of credit that he had previously provided 
the debentures bore interest at the rate of per annum  payable semiannually 
the participating debenture holders exchanged  of their debentures for units under the standby purchase agreement  and we used a portion of the proceeds from the rights offer to prepay the remaining  of debentures outstanding during february investors who purchased the debentures received warrants to purchase a total of  common shares at an exercise price of per share 
those warrants will expire if not exercised by august  since the end of june  the we have had the right to call those warrants for redemption at a redemption price of per share if the closing price of our common shares on the american stock exchange equals or exceeds of the exercise price for fifteen consecutive trading days and the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants have been registered for sale under the securities act of  as amended 

table of contents on march   we entered into a credit agreement with alfred d 
kingsley under which we had the right to borrow up to  for working capital purposes 
this line of credit has expired  and no amounts were borrowed under it 
in connection with entering into the credit agreement on march   we issued to mr 
kingsley warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
the warrants were fully exercisable and non forfeitable on the date of grant and expire on march  the fair value of the warrant was  and was determined using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions contractual life of years  risk free interest rate of  volatility of  and no dividends during the expected term 
the fair value of the warrant was included in other current assets at september   and was being amortized over the term of the credit agreement 
as the credit agreement expired  the warrant was fully expensed at september  the exercise price and number of common shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued to mr 
kingsley and the holders of biotime s debentures  as described above and elsewhere in this report  have been adjusted pursuant to the anti dilution provisions of the respective warrant agreements to give retroactive effect to our rights offer completed in january we will need to obtain additional equity capital from time to time in the future  as long as the fees we receive from licensing our products to pharmaceutical companies  profits from sales of our products  and royalty revenues are not sufficient to fund our operations 
sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders 
the amount of license fees and royalties that may be earned through the licensing and sale of our products and technology  the timing of the receipt of license fee payments  and the future availability and terms of equity financing  are uncertain 
the unavailability or inadequacy of financing or revenues to meet future capital needs could force us to modify  curtail  delay or suspend some or all aspects of our planned operations 
the following depicts our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligation total less than year years debentures operating leases total contractual cash obligations the debentures were retired during february by issuing  common shares and  warrants in exchange for  of debentures and by prepaying the remaining  of debentures in cash 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements revenue recognition under the abbott license agreement  abbott paid us  of license fees between and based upon achievement of specified milestones 
such fees have been recognized as revenue as the milestones were achieved 
up to  of additional license fees will be payable based upon annual net sales of hextend at the rate of of annual net sales if annual net sales exceed  or if annual net sales are between  and  abbott s obligation to pay license fees on sales of hextend will expire on the earlier of january  or  on a country by country basis  when all patents protecting hextend in the applicable country expire or any third party obtains certain regulatory approvals to market a generic equivalent product in that country 
in addition to the license fees  abbott will pay a royalty on annual net sales of hextend 
the royalty rate will be plus an additional 
for each increment of  of annual net sales  up to a maximum royalty rate of 
abbott s obligation to pay royalties on sales of hextend will expire in the united states or canada when all patents protecting hextend in the applicable country expire and any third party obtains certain regulatory approvals to market a generic equivalent product in that country 
we recognize such revenues in the quarter in which the sales report is received  rather than the quarter in which the sales take place  as we do not have sufficient sales history to accurately predict quarterly sales 
revenues for the twelve months ending december  include royalties on sales made by abbott during the twelve months ended september  royalties on sales made during the fourth quarter of will not be recognized by us until the first quarter of fiscal year under the abbott license agreement  we have the right to convert abbott s exclusive license to a non exclusive license or to terminate the license outright if certain minimum sales and royalty payments are not met 
in order to terminate the license outright  biotime would pay a termination fee in an amount ranging from the milestone payments made by abbott to an amount equal to three times prior year net sales  depending upon when termination occurs 
management believes that the probability of payment of any termination fee is remote 
under the cj agreement  cj agreed to pay us a license fee of  payable in two installments 
the first installment of  less  of korean taxes withheld  was paid 
table of contents during april in connection with this agreement  we paid a finder s fee of  to an unrelated third party 
we have not yet completed the development of pentalyte  for which additional clinical trials in the united states are being planned 
as the expected completion date is uncertain  the license fee of  net of the  finder s fee  has been deferred and will be recognized as revenue over the life of the contract  which has been estimated to be approximately eight years based on the current expected life of the governing patent covering our products in korea 
the remaining  is payable within days after an application for regulatory approval to manufacture and market hextend is filed in korea 
in addition to the license fees  cj will pay a royalty on sales of the licensed products 
the royalty will range from to per ml unit of product sold  depending upon the price approved by korea s national health insurance  but cj will have to obtain regulatory approval before sales can begin 
cj will be responsible for obtaining the regulatory approvals required to manufacture and market hextend and pentalyte  including conducting any clinical trials that may be required  and will bear all related costs and expenses 
debenture and warrant valuation in connection with the issuance of  of debt in and in exchange for the right to make scheduled interest payments in biotime stock granted in  we issued warrants to purchase common shares 
the fair value of the warrants was estimated using the black scholes option pricing model and has been recorded at a discount to the debentures 
the discount is being amortized using the effective interest rate method over the term of the loan 
we will recognize the unamortized portion of the discount as a loss on the date we prepaid the debentures 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available evidence and other factors  that we will not realize some portion of  or all of  the deferred tax assets 
we base our determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an ongoing evaluation of current evidence including  among other things  estimates of future earnings and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
we charge or credit adjustments to the valuation allowance to income tax expense in the period in which these determinations are made 
if we determine that we would be able to realize any deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period this determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would charge to operations an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in the period this determination was made
