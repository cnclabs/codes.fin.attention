critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
information with respect to our critical accounting policies which we believe could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require subjective or complex judgments is contained herein 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances we recognize revenue to all customers  including distributors  when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for substantially all sales  revenues are recognized at the time the product is shipped 
we enter into contracts with certain distributors and these contracts permit very limited stock rotation returns 
the company provides an estimated allowance for such returns  and corresponding reductions in revenue are concurrently recorded  based on several factors including past history and notification from customers of pending returns 
actual returns have been within management s expectations 
in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  estimated reductions to revenue are also recorded for customer incentive programs consisting of price protection and volume purchase rebates 
such programs are limited and actual reductions to revenues have been within management s expectations 
we provide a one year product defect warranty from the date of sale 
historically  warranty costs have been nominal and have been within management s expectations 
for a further discussion of our accounting policies regarding revenue recognition see the section entitled our operating results may be affected to the extent actual results differ from accounting estimates under important factors related to forward looking statements and associated risks 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts and do not bear interest 
the accounts receivable amounts shown in the balance sheet are trade account receivable balances at the respective dates  net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on our historical write off experience 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis by type of receivable 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
actual bad debt has been within our expectations and the provisions established and has been consistent with experience of prior years  however  any unexpected significant adverse financial position of any of our major 
table of contents customers or any group of customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  as determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate the carrying value of our inventories taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand and the price we expect to obtain for our products in their respective markets 
we also evaluate the composition of our inventories to identify any slow moving or obsolete products 
the total evaluations require material management judgments  including estimates of future sales  continuing market acceptance of our products  and market and economic conditions 
additionally  inventory reserves are established based upon such judgments for any inventories that are identified as having a net realizable value less than their cost  which is further reduced by related selling expenses 
historically  the net realizable value of our inventories has generally been within management s estimates 
however  if we are unable to meet our sales expectations  or if market conditions deteriorate from management s estimates  reductions in the net realizable value of our inventories could have a material adverse impact on future operating results 
for a further discussion of our accounting policies regarding inventory valuation see the section entitled our operating results may be affected to the extent actual results differ from accounting estimates under important factors related to forward looking statements and associated risks 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
at september   other intangible assets include million of acquired customer lists  million of non patented technology  million of covenants not to compete and million of contract manufacturer relationships 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition 
a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset 
significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions 
current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset 
an evaluation under fas includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
as a result of our analysis  we will record a charge when we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenues and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 

table of contents goodwill all public companies were required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
we adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal year consequently  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  while those intangible assets with known useful lives have continued to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
at least annually  we are required to reassess goodwill 
whenever we determine that there has been an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  we will record an impairment charge against earnings  which equals the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its then fair value  and a reduction in goodwill on our balance sheet 
the identification of intangible assets and determination of the fair value and useful lives of goodwill and other intangible assets are subjective in nature and often involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
the judgments made in determining the estimated useful lives assigned to each class of assets can significantly affect net income 
at the beginning of fiscal year  we had approximately million of unamortized goodwill that resulted from our previous acquisitions 
for the purposes of the evaluation as required by fas  the reporting units with goodwill were identified as scottsdale million  santa ana million  integrated products million  lawrence million and lowell million 
we completed the first step of the transition testing by march  and completed the second step in the quarter ended june  in accordance with sfas no 
 the impairment charge was calculated as the excess  if any  of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill for each reporting unit based on a combination of the market approach weighted and the income approach weighted 
the valuation resulted in a million of goodwill impairment at integrated products  lawrence and lowell 
as required by sfas no 
 a million transition impairment charge was recorded  net of its associated million tax benefit  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  effective as of september  at september   we had approximately million of goodwill that resulted from our previous acquisitions 
million was allocated to santa ana and million was allocated to scottsdale 
as a consequence of the consolidation of santa ana  the million of goodwill has been reallocated to scottsdale in fiscal year the total million of goodwill remained unchanged as of september  effective in and in accordance with sfas  we will not amortize the remaining million of goodwill  however  up to of the remaining goodwill could be determined to be impaired during future evaluations required by fas see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are required by fas to reassess goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we are required to record a charge to income if an impairment has been incurred 
we performed our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal we have determined that no impairment existed because the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting units at september  have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination 
the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
based on an analysis of events that have occurred and circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination  the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is remote 
for a discussion of our accounting policies regarding long lived assets see the section entitled there may be goodwill impairments that would adversely affect microsemi under important factors related to forward looking statements and associated risks 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we have a nexus 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within 
table of contents the consolidated balance sheets 
we have established a valuation allowance for a portion of our deferred tax assets 
if we increase any valuation allowance in a period  it will adversely affect the tax provision in the income statement 
on october   president bush signed into law the working families tax relief act of the act 
the act retroactively extended the expiration date of the research tax credit from june  to december  since the credit was reinstated after september   the company recognized credit through june  the credit retroactively reinstated from july  will be recognized in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending september stock based compensation we account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized for stock options or restricted stock issued to employees with exercise prices at or above quoted market value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas provides an alternative to apb in accounting for stock based compensation issued to employees 
sfas provides for a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options and similar equity instruments 
however  companies that continue to account for stock based compensation arrangements under apb are required by sfas to disclose the pro forma effect on net loss income and net loss income per share as if the fair value based method prescribed by sfas had been applied 
we continue to account for stock based compensation using the provisions of apb and present the pro forma information required by sfas as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year net sales increased million or from million for fiscal year to million for the fiscal year 
the increase included approximately million  million  million and million of higher sales for defense and aerospace  computer and peripheral  mobile connectivity and automotive products  respectively  offset by decreases of approximately million and million in shipments of medical products and of other products  respectively

the breakout of net sales to oem customers which excludes sales to distributors in and were as follows defense aerospace medical notebooks monitors mobile connectivity automotive others gross profit increased million  from million of sales for to million of sales for the improvement in gross profit in was favorably impacted by higher gross margins on new products  improved factory utilization  increased revenues and price increases on high reliability products

results of operations for fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales decreased million or from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the decrease included million lower sales of space and commercial aircraft products  million lower sales to telecom and other commercial customers  partially offset by a million increase of sales of medical products 
the above decrease included the elimination of sales of rf  which had revenues of million in fiscal year and was sold in the third quarter of last year 
the decease in revenues in fiscal year reflected the general decline of the space  commercial aircraft and telecommunications markets 
the increase in revenues from our medical products represented higher demands for our high reliability medical components used in mri systems  pacemakers and implantable cardio defibrillators 
gross profit decreased million  from million of sales for fiscal year to million of sales for fiscal year cost of sales in fiscal year included a write off of million of leasehold improvements at our melrose  massachusetts facility  million for cancellations of contracts and closures of facilities  million for accrued future clean up cost at our colorado facility and million of asset impairments 
these factors had a negative impact on gross margin 
rf had million of gross profit in fiscal year or of sales 
gross profit in also benefited from improved mix of new products shipped and from higher factory utilization 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year  primarily due to lower commission expenses as a result of lower sales  the elimination of expenses associated with rf and the consolidations of our watertown and melrose  massachusetts facilities into our lowell and lawrence  massachusetts facilities  partially offset by an increase in insurance and other employee benefits 
research and development expenses decreased million  from million for fiscal year to million for fiscal year the decrease was due to the disposition of our carlsbad design center

net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the fiscal years  and  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily a result of the million increase in loss that was partially offset by the combined effect of non cash items included in income or expense  such as depreciation and amortization  gain on retirement and dispositions of assets  impairment of assets  tax benefits resulted from stock options and changes in deferred income taxes  accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income tax payable

the estimated cost to consolidate the santa ana plant will be between million to million  including million to million in future costs to complete this project in fiscal year we anticipate that the source for paying such costs will be our cash and cash equivalents 
as of the end of fiscal year  we had no additional material commitments for capital expenditures 
further plant consolidations may occur in the future 
any proceeds from sales of assets should enhance our cash position  however  we believe we can meet our cash requirements without the receipt of such proceeds 
we are involved in certain patent litigation see legal proceedings which could cause legal costs to increase above normal levels over the next several years 
it is not possible to estimate the exact amounts of these costs  but it is possible that these costs could have a material effect on our future results 
we have been incurring costs associated with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act

recently adopted accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
chapter 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
it requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement shall be applied prospectively for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement would have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and stock market 
we are exposed to various market risks  related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we conduct business in a number of foreign currencies  principally those of europe and asia  directly or in our foreign operations 
we may receive some revenues in foreign currencies and purchase some inventory and services in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in exchange rates of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
transactions in foreign currencies have represented a relatively small portion of our business 
also these currencies have been relatively stable against the us dollar for the past several years 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact historically on our revenues or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that those currencies will remain stable relative to the us dollar or that future fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies will not have material adverse effects on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the largest foreign currency exposure of ours results from activity in british pounds and the european union euro 
we have not conducted a foreign currency hedging program thus far 
we have and may continue to consider the adoption of a foreign currency hedging program 
we did not enter into derivative financial instruments and did not enter into any other financial instruments for trading  speculative purposes or to manage our interest rate risk 
our other financial instruments consist primarily of cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and long term obligations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to short term investments and short term obligations 
as a result  we do not expect fluctuations in interest rates to have a material impact on the fair value of these instruments 
we do not engage in transactions intended to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we currently have a  revolving line of credit  which expires in march at september    was utilized for a letter of credit  consequently   was available under this line of credit 
it bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus to per annum or  at our option  at the eurodollar rate plus to per annum 
the interest rate is determined by the ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
for instance  if we were to borrow presently the entire  from this credit line  a one percent increase in the interest rate would result in an additional  of pre tax interest expense annually
