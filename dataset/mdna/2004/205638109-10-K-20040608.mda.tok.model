item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this discussion contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws which are identified by the use of the words believes  expects  anticipates  will  contemplates  would and similar expressions that contemplate future events 
numerous important factors  risks and uncertainties affect our operating results  including  without limitation  those discussed below  and contained elsewhere in this report  and could cause actual results to differ materially from the results implied by these or any other forward looking statements made by us  or on our behalf 
there can be no assurance that future results will meet expectations 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
except as required by applicable law  we do not undertake any obligation to publicly release any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report 
in  we filed a lawsuit against ibm alleging  among other things  copyright infringement  misappropriation of trade secrets  intentional interference with contractual relations and economic expectancy  false advertising and various violations of the lanham act  as well as various anti trust law violations 
we claim that ibm has misappropriated portions of our software tools  used our technology to develop competing products  used its monopoly power to engage in unlawful tying arrangements and subverted competition on the merits 
ibm has filed a counterclaim against us alleging violation of six of their patents and in filed a separate complaint against us alleging violation of seven different ibm patents 
pursuing and defending these matters will be costly  time consuming and may divert management s time and attention 
due to these matters  our legal expenses have increased substantially and our administrative and general expenses could further increase as a result of these factors 
in addition  ibm may seek to influence our customers and potential customers to reduce or eliminate the amount of our products and services that they purchase  or our lawsuit against ibm and ibm s lawsuit against us may otherwise be viewed negatively by our customers and potential customers and cause them to refrain from buying our products and services 
any of the foregoing developments could adversely affect our position in the marketplace and our results of operations 
while we are expanding our focus on distributed software products  a majority of our revenue from software products is dependent on our customers continued use of ibm and ibm compatible mainframe products and on the acceptance of our pricing structure for software licenses and maintenance 
the pricing of our software licenses and maintenance is under constant pressure from customers and competitive vendors 
in addition to the ibm claims discussed above  there can be no assurance that other third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future with respect to current and future products or that any such assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
our operating margins may decline 
we do not regularly compile margin analysis other than on a segment basis 
however  we are aware that operating expenses associated with our distributed systems products are higher than those associated with our traditional mainframe products 
since we believe the best opportunities for revenue growth are in the distributed systems market  product operating margins could experience more pressure 
in addition  operating margins in the professional services business are significantly impacted by small fluctuations in revenue since most costs are fixed during any short term period 
our results could be adversely affected by increased competition and pricing pressures 
we consider over firms to be directly competitive with one or more of our products 
these competitors include but are not limited to bmc software  inc  borland  computer associates international  inc  ibm  mercury interactive corporation and niku corporation 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  recruiting and training resources than we do 
the market for professional services is highly competitive  fragmented and characterized by low barriers to entry 
our principal competitors in professional services include but are not limited to accenture  computer sciences corporation  electronic data systems corporation  ibm global services  analysts international corporation  keane  inc and numerous other regional and local firms in the markets in which we have professional services offices 
several of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  recruiting and training resources than we do 
our success depends in part on our ability to develop product enhancements and new products that keep pace with continuing changes in technology and customer preferences 
approximately of our total revenue is derived from foreign sources 
this exposes us to exchange rate risks on foreign currencies and to other international risks such as the need to comply with foreign and us export laws  and the uncertainty of certain foreign economies 
we regard our software as proprietary and attempt to protect it with copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws and or restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we depend on key employees and technical personnel 
the loss of certain key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our quarterly financial results vary and may be adversely affected by certain relatively fixed costs 
our product revenues vary from quarter to quarter 
net income may be disproportionately affected by a fluctuation in revenues because only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenues 
historical seasonality in license revenue cannot be relied on as an indicator of future performance due to the current economic conditions affecting the it industry 
changes in world economies could cause customers to further delay or forego decisions to license new products or upgrades to their existing environments or to reduce their requirements for professional services  and this could adversely affect our operating results 
acts of terrorism  acts of war and other unforeseen events may cause damage or disruption to our properties  employees  suppliers  distributors  resellers and customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
overview in this section  we discuss our results of operations on a segment basis for each of our financial reporting segments 
we operate in two business segments in the technology industry products and professional services 
we evaluate segment performance based primarily on segment contribution before corporate expenses 
references to years are to fiscal years ended march we provide software products and professional services designed to increase the productivity of the it departments of businesses worldwide 
in the early years of our company  we focused on offering professional services and mainframe products in the testing and implementation environment where we gained extensive experience and established long term customer relationships 
over the past several years  we have expanded our presence into products and professional services in the application development and integration  quality assurance  production readiness and production availability areas of the application life cycle 
we focus on growing revenue and profit margins by enhancing and promoting our current product lines  expanding our product and service offerings through key acquisitions  developing strategic partnerships in order to provide clients with our product solutions and managing our costs 
we achieved the following since the beginning of fiscal acquired certain assets of covisint effective march  covisint provides business to business applications and communication services that connect the global automotive industry 
revenue associated with the acquired business was approximately million during covisint s calendar year we do not expect covisint to have a material effect on earnings in fiscal acquired changepoint corporation in may changepoint offerings provide chief information officers with insight and visibility into their people  projects  resources and applications  helping technology leaders align it investments with business priorities 
revenue associated with the acquired business was approximately million for the twelve months ending april we do not expect changepoint to have a material effect on earnings in fiscal released mainframe and distributed products  during fiscal  designed to increase the productivity of the it departments of our customers 
achieved increases in distributed product revenue which is a reflection of our increased focus in fiscal on promoting our distributed products 
began realigning our professional service segment to higher margin offerings 
this was evident in fiscal as we decreased our revenue derived from low margin subcontract projects 
we will continue this trend in fiscal where we anticipate a first quarter reduction in subcontract revenue and cost of approximately million and million  respectively 
implemented a cost reduction strategy that included salary reductions for executive management and most employees  additional employee contributions toward healthcare  elimination of company sponsored holiday events and a review of other expenses 
these measures were intended to save a total of million to million each quarter  starting in the third quarter of savings in the third and fourth quarters of were in line with our overall estimates 
due to the positive financial results reported during the third and fourth quarters of and the outlook for continued revenue and profitability growth  certain of the cost cutting measures that were put in place primarily salary reductions were rescinded effective april  our ability to achieve our strategies and objectives is subject to a number of factors some of which we may not be able to control 
see forward looking statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operational data from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenues and the percentage change in such items compared to the prior period percentage of period to period total revenues change fiscal year ended march  to to revenue software license fees maintenance fees professional services fees total revenues operating expenses cost of software license fees cost of professional services technology development and support sales and marketing administrative and general goodwill amortization and impairment restructuring cost total operating expenses income loss from operations other income income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income loss not meaningful software products revenue our products are designed to support four key activities within the application development process development and integration  quality assurance  production readiness and performance management of the application to optimize performance in production 
product revenue which consists of software license fees and maintenance fees  comprised  and of total revenue during  and  respectively 
os product revenue mainframe revenue decreased million or during and decreased million or during revenue from distributed software products increased by million  or during and decreased million  or during license revenue increased million or during to million from million during and decreased million or during from million during license revenue was positively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currencies during compared to fiscal excluding the favorable effect of such foreign currency fluctuations  license revenue would have been approximately million during fiscal  compared to million during fiscal  a decrease of 
maintenance fees decreased million or to million during from million during and decreased million or during from million during maintenance fees were positively impacted by fluctuations in foreign currencies during compared to fiscal excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  maintenance fees would have been approximately million during  compared to million during  a decrease of 
the overall declines in product revenue from to and from to were primarily attributable to decreases in mainframe license fees and maintenance fees associated with an overall decrease in technology spending and a decrease in customer demand for large enterprise license agreements which are multi year  and often multi payment contracts 
we license software to customers using two types of software licenses  perpetual and term 
generally  perpetual software licenses allow customers a perpetual right to run our software on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips millions of instructions per second capacity or to run our distributed software for a specified number of users or servers 
term licenses allow customers a right to run our software for a limited period of time on hardware up to a licensed aggregate mips capacity 
also  our customers purchase maintenance services that provide technical support and advice  including problem resolution services and assistance in product installation  error corrections and any product enhancements released during the maintenance period 
furthermore  based on customers business needs  customers are allowed to license additional software and purchase multiple years of maintenance in a single transaction multi year transactions 
in support of these multi year transactions  we allow extended payment terms to qualifying customers 
to recognize revenue for these multi year transactions the contract price is allocated between maintenance revenue and license revenue 
all license revenue associated with perpetual license agreements is recognized when the customer commits unconditionally to the transaction  the software products and quantities are fixed  the software has been shipped to the customer and collection is reasonably probable 
license revenue associated with term transactions or with transactions that include an option to exchange or select products in the future is deferred and recognized over the term of the agreement 
when the license portion is paid over a number of years  the license portion of the payment stream is discounted to its net present value 
interest income is recognized over the payment term 
the maintenance revenue associated with all sales is deferred and is recognized over the applicable maintenance period 
product revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    europe and africa    other international operations    total product revenue    product contribution and expenses financial information for the product segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    expenses    product contribution    the product segment generated contribution margins of  and during  and  respectively 
product expenses include cost of software license fees  technology development and support costs  and sales and marketing expenses 
these factors are discussed below 
cost of software license fees includes amortization of capitalized software  the cost of duplicating and disseminating products to customers and the cost of author royalties 
as a percentage of software license fees  cost of software license fees were  and in  and  respectively 
technology development and support includes  primarily  the costs of programming personnel associated with product development and support less the amount of software development costs capitalized during the period 
also included here are personnel costs associated with developing and maintaining internal systems and hardware software costs required to support technology initiatives 
as a percentage of product revenue  costs of technology development and support were  and in  and  respectively 
capitalization of internally developed software products begins when technological feasibility of the product is established 
before the capitalization of internally developed software products  total research and development expenditures during increased million or  to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the increase in technology costs for was primarily attributable to higher compensation  benefit and bonus costs of approximately million offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of approximately million 
compensation  benefit and bonus costs were higher due to scheduled salary increases during and higher employee headcount in this area which increased by to an average headcount of  people during depreciation expense declined due to approximately million of computer equipment which became fully depreciated in the first and second quarters of a portion of the increase was offset by cost reduction strategies implemented in october that resulted in a reduction of technology development and support costs totaling during the third and fourth quarters of the decrease in technology costs for was primarily attributable to lower bonus costs of approximately million  decreases in computer equipment depreciation and purchased software amortization totaling approximately million and reduced travel and communication costs of approximately million 
sales and marketing costs consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with product direct sales and sales support  marketing for all our offerings  and personnel costs associated with new sales initiatives 
sales and marketing costs increased million or  during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in as a percentage of product revenue  sales and marketing costs were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing costs for was primarily attributable to higher salary and benefit costs of approximately million  increased commission and bonus costs of approximately million and higher advertising costs of approximately million 
compensation  benefit  commission and bonus costs were higher due to salary increases during  higher employee headcount in this area which increased by to an average headcount of  people during and the negative effect of foreign currency fluctuations on these costs as the us dollar continued to weaken throughout fiscal approximately of total sales and marketing compensation  benefit  commission and bonus costs were attributable to our non us sales force 
the change in advertising costs was a result of increases in the promotion of our products in the distributed software marketplace during fiscal in late october  we implemented cost reduction strategies that resulted in a reduction of sales and marketing costs totaling million during the third and fourth quarters of the decrease in sales and marketing costs for was primarily attributable to reduced headcount which decreased by to an average headcount of  people during resulting in lower compensation and benefit costs of approximately million  decreased travel costs of approximately million and lower bonus and commission costs of approximately million 
professional services revenue we offer a broad range of it professional services  including business systems analysis  design and programming  software conversion and system planning and consulting 
revenue from professional services decreased million or during and decreased million or during the decrease in revenue for was due  primarily  to a reduction in demand for professional services as customers continue to postpone large projects  continued downward pressure on our billing rates due to the highly competitive nature of the professional services market and an increased effort in fiscal to reduce our involvement with lower margin subcontract it projects in order to focus our resources on higher margin projects for the future 
the decrease in revenue for was due  primarily  to a reduction in customer demand for professional services  the january assignment of our prime contract with a client to a company in which we have a minority equity investment caretech  and to a lesser extent  the transfer of our engineering business to an unrelated third party in december professional services revenue was further negatively impacted by the closing of certain underperforming branch offices associated with the restructuring discussed below 
professional services revenue by geographic location is presented in the table below in thousands year ended march  united states    europe and africa    other international operations    total professional services revenue    professional services contribution and expenses financial information for the professional services segment is as follows in thousands year ended march  revenue    expenses    professional services contribution    during  the professional services segment generated a contribution margin of  compared to and during and  respectively 
cost of professional services consists primarily of personnel related costs of providing services  including billable staff  subcontractors and sales personnel 
cost of professional services decreased million or during and decreased million or during the decrease in cost of professional services for was primarily attributable to lower compensation  benefit  bonus and travel costs of approximately million and a decrease in subcontractor costs of approximately million 
compensation  benefit  bonus and travel costs were lower due to a reduction in average employee headcount in this area to  people during in late october  we implemented cost reduction strategies that resulted in a reduction of professional services costs totaling million during the third and fourth quarters of all professional services salaries have been reviewed and adjusted effective april  the decrease in cost of professional services for was primarily attributable to reductions in staff associated with the restructuring discussed below  resulting in lower salaries and benefits  and decreased use of subcontractors for special services 
the professional services billable staff decreased to an average headcount of  people during corporate and other expenses administrative and general expenses consist of costs associated with the operations and administration of the company 
these costs include the corporate executive  finance  human resources  legal and corporate communications departments 
in addition  administrative and general costs include all facility related costs  such as rent  building depreciation  maintenance  utilities  etc  associated with all of our locations 
administrative and general expenses increased million or  during to million from million in and decreased million or during from million in the increase in administrative and general expenses for was primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees of approximately million and higher depreciation expense associated with the new detroit headquarters building of approximately million 
in late october  we implemented cost reduction strategies that resulted in a reduction to administrative and general costs totaling million during the third and fourth quarters of the decrease in administrative and general expenses in was primarily attributable to decreased building rent of approximately million  decreased utility costs of approximately million and decreased compensation  benefit and bonus costs of approximately million resulting from the restructuring discussed below offset  in part  by increased legal costs of approximately million 
external legal fees for all litigation  including ibm and other matters were million  million and million in  and litigation expense has increased significantly over the past two years due primarily to the ibm litigation 
because a majority of the costs in connection with the ibm litigation have been incurred during the preparation of this case for trial  we do not expect litigation expenses to increase 
barring any unknown future litigation claims  these expenses should decline moderately 
other income consists primarily of interest earnings on deferred customer receivables and interest income realized from investments 
other income for was million compared to million in and million in income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit of million relating primarily to favorable tax settlements with the us internal revenue service and recent developments in other tax matters both in the us and other taxing jurisdictions 
excluding this tax benefit  the effective tax rate for was compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the higher percentage impact of certain tax benefit items as a result of the decline in income 
the income tax provision was million for  net of the million income tax benefit in the third quarter 
this compares to an income tax provision of million for restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of  we adopted a restructuring plan to reorganize our operating divisions  primarily the professional services segment 
these changes were designed to increase profitability in the future by better aligning cost structures with current market conditions 
the restructuring plan included a reduction of professional services staff at certain locations  the closing of entire professional services offices and a reduction of sales support personnel  lab technicians and related administrative and financial staff 
approximately  employees worldwide were terminated as a result of the reorganization 
the following table summarizes the accrual for the restructuring and charges against the accrual during  and in thousands employee facilities costs legal  consulting total termination primarily lease and outplacement restructuring benefits abandonments costs other charge restructuring charge     incurred during year ended march   accrual at march      incurred during year ended march     adjustment   accrual at march    incurred during year ended march    accrual at march    lease obligations will end in march of during the year ended march   the company determined the accruals associated with employee terminations  legal and outplacement were in excess of actual costs incurred 
these excess accruals have been reduced 
the accrual for facilities costs was increased  since the company had not been as successful in subleasing abandoned leased space as originally anticipated 
approximately of the accrual related to facilities costs is included in long term accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet at march  management s discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates note of the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
assumptions and estimates were based on facts and circumstances at march  however  future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be the most important to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition a basic criteria for revenue recognition is that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we evaluate collectibility based on past customer history  external credit ratings and payment terms within various customer agreements 
future events or inaccuracies in reported credit data that result in a change to collectibility expectations could have a negative effect on our operating results 
perpetual license fee revenue is recognized using the residual method  under which the fair value  based on compuware specific objective evidence csoe  of all undelivered elements of the agreement eg maintenance and professional services is deferred 
csoe is based on rates charged for maintenance and professional services when sold separately 
changes in rates charged for stand alone maintenance and professional services could have a significant impact on how bundled revenue agreements are characterized as license  maintenance or professional services and therefore  on the timing of revenue recognition in the future 
generally  revenues from license and maintenance transactions that include installment payment terms are recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
this is because we have an established business practice of offering installment payment terms to customers and have a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms without making concessions 
however  because a significant portion of our license fee revenue is earned in connection with installment sales  changes in future economic conditions or technological developments could adversely affect our ability to immediately record license fees for these types of transactions and or limit our ability to collect these receivables 
professional services fees professional services fees are generally based on hourly or daily rates 
however  for services rendered under fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
unforeseen events that result in additional time or costs being required to complete such projects could affect the timing of revenue recognition for the balance of the project as well as services margins going forward  and could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
based on our interpretation of us gaap including sop and  securities and exchange commission sab and eitf  we believe our revenue has been properly reported 
new interpretations or pronouncements related to software revenue recognition policies could result in changes to our method of revenue recognition in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts the collectibility of accounts receivable is regularly evaluated and we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is appropriate for our accounts receivable balances 
in evaluating the allowance  we consider historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and the aging of outstanding receivables 
larger accounts are reviewed on a detail basis  giving consideration to collection experience and any information on the financial viability of the customer 
the allowance is reviewed and adjusted each quarter based on the best information available at the time 
unforeseen events which negatively affect the ability of our customer s to meet their payment obligations would negatively impact our ability to collect outstanding amounts due from customers and may cause a material impact on our financial position and results of operations due to a change in the assumptions and judgment on which we base this estimate 
capitalized software the cost of purchased and internally developed software is capitalized and stated at the lower of unamortized cost or expected net realizable value 
we compute annual amortization using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the software product which is generally five years 
software is subject to rapid technological obsolescence and future product revenue estimates supporting the capitalized software cost can be negatively affected based upon competitive products and pricing 
such adverse developments could reduce the estimated net realizable value of our capitalized software and could result in impairment or a shorter estimated life 
such events would require us to take a charge in the period in which the event occurred or to increase the amortization expense in future periods and would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
impairment of goodwill we are required to assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may exceed the fair value 
to analyze goodwill  we measure its fair value using an estimate of the related business s discounted cash flow 
the discounted cash flow approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  and a terminal growth rate 
the fair value of the reporting unit including the goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of each reporting unit products and professional services 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  the impairment loss is recognized as an operating expense in an amount equal to that excess 
changes in any of these estimates and assumptions  and unknown future events or circumstances eg economic conditions or technological developments  could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
investments in partially owned companies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have minority investments in and advances to certain privately held companies for strategic purposes 
at march   the net carrying value of our investments and advances to these entities totaled million 
additionally  we have guaranteed outstanding lease obligations of million at march  we regularly evaluate the financial condition of these partially owned companies to assess potential impairment in the carrying value of our investments in and advances to these entities 
we consider their current financial situation  including their ability to meet current cash requirements  expected future cash flows and any other information known to us in determining whether an impairment charge is appropriate 
unknown factors or unforeseen events that impair their ability to pay their obligations or to operate profitably could have an impact on our ability to recoup our investments in and outstanding advances to these companies and could require us to expense all or a portion of the outstanding investments and advances in that period 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance and tax liabilities we estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  net deferred tax assets based on expected future taxable benefits in such jurisdictions and our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
for additional information regarding these estimates see note to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in estimates of projected future operating results or in assumptions regarding our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences are deductible could result in significant changes to these accruals and  therefore  to our net income 
in addition  we recognize contingent tax liabilities through tax expense for estimated exposures related to our current tax positions 
we evaluate the need for contingent tax liabilities on a quarterly basis and any change in the amount will be recorded in our results of operations  as appropriate 
it could take several years to resolve certain of these contingencies 
other other accounting policies  although not generally subject to the same level of estimation as those discussed above  are nonetheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
many assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses require some degree of estimation or judgment in determining the appropriate accounting 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   cash and investments totaled approximately million 
during and  cash flow from operations was million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of operating cash flow is generated from the collection of the current portion of prior years receivables 
the decrease was primarily due to lower collections on customer receivables due to the general decline in revenue from the prior year 
during these periods  capital expenditures for the detroit headquarters facility totaled million and million  respectively  and capital expenditures for other property and equipment and capitalized research and software development totaled million and million  respectively 
on may   we entered into a million revolving credit facility maturing on july  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this revolving credit facility 
no borrowings have occurred or are planned under this facility 
we intend to renew this facility upon expiration 
we have relocated to our new corporate headquarters building 
the total construction cost approximated million for the building and million for furniture and fixtures 
annual depreciation expense is approximately million 
future cash requirements to complete the construction will be minimal in fiscal year in july we entered into an option and purchase agreement for our farmington hills  michigan facility 
the option agreement allows the holder to commit to purchase the building for one year after the execution of the agreement 
the option selling price of the building approximates the current net book value of million for the building 
if exercised  the holder would pay million upon exercise and the remaining balance in five years with interest being paid monthly at of the unpaid balance 
on may   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
our purchases of stock may occur on the open market  through negotiated or block transactions based upon market and business conditions 
we regularly evaluate market conditions for an opportunity to repurchase our stock 
during august  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock under this program at an average price of per share 
approximately million remains for future purchases under this program 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we regularly review the financial condition of our partially owned companies  inclusive of considering the companies relationships with their major customers  to determine that the recorded amounts in our financial statements are appropriate and the investments inclusive of the debt obligations are not impaired 
caretech solutions  inc s caretech most significant customer is the detroit medical center and subsidiaries dmc 
the dmc has publicly announced it is having financial difficulties 
after consideration of all relevant factors  we concluded that no impairment charge or valuation allowance related to our investment in and receivables due from caretech should be recorded at march  the dmc has requested  and caretech has agreed  to provide the dmc with extended payment terms up to days 
in turn  we have also agreed to extend day payment terms to caretech 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the other shareholders of caretech expressed an inability or unwillingness to provide additional funding to meet any short falls in caretech s cash flow requirements 
therefore  we will record percent of any future losses incurred by caretech as a reduction to our outstanding advances to caretech 
at march   the carrying value of investments in and advances to caretech was million 
on february   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with covisint llc covisint which became effective march  we acquired selected assets and certain liabilities related to their communicate portal solutions  connect and problem solver businesses acquired business for approximately million in cash plus certain lease obligations up to million 
in may  we acquired all outstanding shares of changepoint corporation  a privately held market leader of it governance application software for approximately million in cash 
the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase during the first quarter of fiscal  and  accordingly  assets and liabilities acquired will be recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date 
we continue to evaluate business acquisition opportunities that fit our strategic plans 
we believe available cash resources  together with cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to meet cash needs for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our payments under contractual obligations and our other commercial commitments as of march  in thousands payment due by period as of march  and total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases        other     total        other includes a million commitment to various city of detroit charities and a million advertising agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed lease obligations of caretech of up to million 
we have not recorded any liability related to these guarantees since we believe that caretech will continue to meet its obligations 
at march   caretech s outstanding lease obligations were approximately million 
we currently do not have any non consolidated special purpose entity arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that we take the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate and foreign exchange exposures on our financial position and operating performance 
we do not use derivative financial instruments or forward foreign exchange contracts for investment  speculative or trading purposes 
immediate changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates discussed in the following paragraphs are hypothetical rate scenarios used to calibrate risk and do not currently represent management s view of future market developments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash investments and installment receivables 
derivative financial instruments are not a part of our investment strategy 
investments are placed with high quality issuers to preserve invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
in addition  marketable debt securities and long term debt investments are classified as held to maturity which does not expose the consolidated statement of operations or balance sheet to fluctuations in interest rates 
the table below provides information about our investment portfolio

foreign currency risk we have entered into forward foreign exchange contracts primarily to hedge amounts due to or from select subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria we use for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and one to one matching of derivative instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income  offsetting foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign balances being hedged 
if the underlying hedged transaction is terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in income in the same period 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as a hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material net gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign currency denominated balance would be offset by the gain or loss on the forward contract 
we operate in certain countries in latin america and asia pacific where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus we have unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies
