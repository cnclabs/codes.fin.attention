item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview allos therapeutics  inc is a biopharmaceutical company that is focused on developing and commercializing innovative small molecule drugs for improving cancer treatments 
small molecule drugs  in general  are non protein products produced by chemical synthesis rather than biological methods 
we strive to develop drugs that improve the treatment of cancer and enhance the power of current therapies 
our goal is to build a profitable company by generating income from products we develop and commercialize  either alone or together with one or more potential strategic partners 
our focus is on product opportunities that leverage our internal clinical development and regulatory expertise and address important medical markets 
we have two product candidates that are currently under development  rsr efaproxiral and pdx propargyl deazaaminopterin 
in addition  we endeavor to grow our existing portfolio of product candidates through ongoing product acquisition and in licensing efforts 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and clinical development 
we have never generated any revenue from product sales  and have experienced significant net losses since our inception in for the years ended december   and  we had net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue incurring net losses for the foreseeable future 
the presence and size of these potential net losses will depend  in large part  on if and when we receive regulatory approval in the united states or europe to market rsr as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer 
our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability  alone or with partners  to successfully complete the development of our product candidates  conduct clinical trials  obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  and manufacture and market our product candidates 
on april   we announced the preliminary results of our pivotal phase trial of rsr in patients with brain metastases in which the survival benefit observed did not reach statistical significance in either of the pre specified intent to treat groups 
however  the results demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit in patients with brain metastases originating from breast cancer 
based on these findings  in december  we submitted an nda to the fda for approval to market rsr as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer 
in february  the fda accepted our nda with priority review and established an action date by june we also intend to submit an maa in europe for approval to market rsr in this indication in the first half of in june  given the uncertainty provided by the results of our pivotal phase trial of rsr in patients with brain metastases and the potential impact on our business  we implemented certain cost reduction measures and reduced our quarterly operating expenses to approximately million 
in connection with this restructuring  we reduced the size of our organization from to employees  cancelled certain purchase orders for rsr bulk drug substance and terminated our phase trial of rsr in nsclc 
in october  we entered into a settlement and termination agreement and mutual release of claims with n gene research laboratories  inc  which terminated all of our rights and licenses to the intellectual property surrounding bgp  an investigational compound that we in licensed from n gene in march  and settled certain disputes between the parties under the original license agreement 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  we paid n gene an aggregate of  in settlement fees and expenses and relinquished our equity investment in n gene  which had a book value of million and was recorded as an impairment charge in also in october  we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with durus life sciences master fund  ltd 
the fund  pursuant to which we settled certain claims against the fund and certain of its affiliates under section b of the securities exchange act of such claims arose out of the funds transactions in our common stock during the period from june  through july   during which time it was a beneficial owner of or more of our outstanding common stock 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the fund paid us a one time settlement fee of approximately million  and we released and discharged the fund and certain of its affiliates from any and all further claims by us and or our shareholders arising under section b with respect to these transactions 
on november   we completed a million private placement of securities with several institutional investors 
pursuant to the terms of the securities purchase agreement  we sold  shares of common stock at a purchaser price of per share  and issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the purchase price for the common stock was privately negotiated with the purchasers to represent an approximately discount to the market value of our common stock on november  the warrants first become exercisable on may   and expire on november  in february  we announced the initiation of a phase trial of rsr plus wbrt in the treatment of patients with brain metastases originating from breast cancer 
in  the financial impact of this study is expected to represent approximately of our anticipated research and development expenses 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and long term marketable securities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the calendar year however  we will require significant levels of additional capital beyond from outside sources to continue research and development activities  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals and build sales and marketing capabilities  as necessary 
if rsr is approved for marketing in the united states  we would expect to increase our operating expenses by at least to million during the first months after launch in order to develop a commercial organization and to engage in marketing activities 
in europe  we anticipate engaging a corporate partner that would  upon marketing approval of rsr  incur the majority of launch related expenses 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs of basic research  nonclinical studies  clinical trials  regulatory affairs  biostatistical data analysis  patents and licensing fees for new products 
years ended december  in millions research and development expenses  as reported non cash charges recoveries the million increase in was due primarily to increased headcount to support our clinical trials and to develop a regulatory department  and paying an initial up front license fee related to the in licensing of the pdx compound 
the million decrease in was due primarily to the termination of our phase trial of rsr in nsclc  determining our final site payments for our phase trial of rsr in brain metastases  lower patient enrollment in our clinical trials and a reduction in our license fee payments for the pdx compound 
we expect research and development expenses to increase moderately in  due primarily to costs associated with our phase clinical trial of rsr for brain metastases from breast cancer  the phase b study of rsr in patients with nsclc  the commencement of a multi site study of pdx for nsclc  and a milestone payment for pdx due in june the amount and timing of the increased costs related to our clinical trials is difficult to predict due to the uncertainty inherent in the timing of clinical trial initiations  the rate of patient enrollment and the detailed design of future trials 
in addition  if we receive approval in the united states or europe in to market rsr as an adjunct to radiation therapy for the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer  we expect to incur additional research and development expenses as we build clinical infrastructure to support our commercialization efforts 
in order to fund our research and development programs after  we will require significant levels of additional capital 
if we do not receive approval to market rsr in the united states or europe and are otherwise unable to raise sufficient additional funds  we may be forced to curtail our development plans for one or more of our product candidates  including rsr  in which case our research and development expenses may decrease materially 
clinical manufacturing 
clinical manufacturing expenses include third party manufacturing costs for rsr for use in clinical trials  costs associated with pre commercial scale up of manufacturing to support anticipated commercial requirements  and development activities for clinical trial material for pdx 
years ended december  in millions clinical manufacturing  as reported the  increase in resulted from increased headcount and consulting expenses to support our anticipated nda filing and pre manufacturing costs for bgp the million increase in was due primarily to a million termination fee associated with the cancellation of our purchase orders for rsr bulk drug substance and increased development work to produce clinical trial drug material for pdx 
we currently have a sufficient supply of rsr bulk drug substance and formulated drug product to support all of our currently pending and or planned clinical trials involving rsr as a result  we expect clinical manufacturing expenses to decrease significantly in until such time  if any  as we initiate manufacturing efforts for commercialization of rsr if fda approval is received  we anticipate a moderate increase of clinical manufacturing expenses to establish a supply of finished goods inventory 
the timing of future payments for finished goods inventory in relation to the timing of regulatory approval may cause variability in our future cost of goods sold and clinical manufacturing expenses 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include costs for pre marketing activities  executive administration  corporate offices and related infrastructure and corporate development 
years ended december  in millions marketing  general and administrative  as reported non cash charges recoveries the million increase in was primarily due to costs associated with relocating our company headquarters  additional personnel costs related to our administrative infrastructure and corporate development  and increased facility costs 
the  increase in was primarily attributable to the fees and expenses incurred in connection with our settlement of claims with n gene research laboratories 
if we obtain regulatory approval for rsr  we expect marketing  general and administrative expenses to increase significantly as personnel are hired to develop a commercial organization and expenses are incurred to support pre launch marketing activities 
if we do not obtain regulatory approval for rsr or if we are not able to raise sufficient additional funds to support our operations  our marketing  general and administrative costs will likely decrease as we may be required to reduce our administrative infrastructure to conserve our capital resources 
restructuring costs 
we recorded  in restructuring costs during the year ended december  the restructuring expenses include severance and other employee termination costs of approximately  and legal fees of  as of december   there was no remaining liability related to the restructuring 
gain on settlement claims 
in  we recognized a gain on settlement claims of approximately million in connection with our receipt of the one time settlement fee from durus life sciences master fund  ltd 
interest and other income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  for  and was million  million and  respectively 
the million and million decrease in and  respectively  primarily resulted from lower average investment balances and lower yields on united states government securities  high grade commercial paper and corporate notes and money market funds 
income taxes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future regular and alternative taxable income 
these carryforwards will expire beginning the utilization of the loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards 
in addition  the availability of the net operating loss carryforwards to reduce united states federal taxable income is subject to various limitations in the event of an ownership change in our stock 
non cash charges 
we have recorded stock based compensation expense resulting primarily from certain options granted prior to our initial public offering with exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on their respective grant dates 
during  we recorded million in marketing  general and administrative  million in research and development and  in clinical manufacturing 
during  we recorded million in marketing  general and administrative  negative million in research and development and  in clinical manufacturing 
the negative balance recorded in research and development is a result of recovery of an expense of million that was recorded in prior periods due to the cancellation of a former employee s unvested options 
during  we recorded a negative  in marketing  general and administrative   in research and development and  in clinical manufacturing 
the negative balance recorded in marketing  general and administrative is due to the change in employment status of our chairman from an employee to a consultant  resulting in the recovery of expenses totaling  related to stock based compensation expense on unvested stock options recorded in prior periods 
at december   we had  of unamortized deferred compensation remaining to be expensed in future years 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of common and preferred stock  a public equity financing  and interest income  which have resulted in net proceeds to us of million through december  we have used million of cash for operating activities through december  cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term marketable securities were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in operating activities was primarily to fund net losses  excluding non cash charges 
net cash provided by investing activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the maturities of short term investments  partially offset by the purchase of short term investments  acquisition of property and equipment and the investment in equity of another company in net cash used in financing activities during was  and consisted primarily of pledging collateral for a line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities during and was million and million  respectively  and resulted from the private sale of common stock  exercise of common stock options  and proceeds from sales of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
below is a schedule of timing of contractual commitments related to our leases and service contracts 
we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements 
less than year years years more than years total operating leases     other long term obligations    total contractual cash obligations    other long term obligations represent future milestone payments under our in licensing commitments  which could be paid earlier depending on the timing of achieving the pertinent milestone 
based upon the current status of our product development and commercialization plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the calendar year we anticipate continuing our current development programs and beginning other long term development projects on new products or technologies 
these projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
therefore  we will need to obtain additional funds from outside sources to continue research and development activities  fund operating expenses  pursue regulatory approvals and build sales and marketing capabilities  as necessary 
however  our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the status of our product development programs  the time and cost involved in conducting clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals  the time and cost involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to market and distribute our future products and establish new collaborative and licensing arrangements 
we intend to raise additional capital in the future through arrangements with corporate partners  equity or debt financings  or from other sources  including the proceeds of product sales  if any 
such arrangements  if successfully consummated  may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in consummating any such arrangements 
in addition  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources  such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
in the event we are not able to raise sufficient additional funds  we will be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs and our business and future prospects for revenue and profitability may be harmed 
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial position are determined based on the application of our accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our critical accounting policies are important to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and the results presented in the financial statements require management to make judgments and estimates that are inherently uncertain 
we record the costs of clinical studies  clinical development  finished drug inventory  regulatory affairs  biostatistical data analysis  non clinical studies  basic research and licensing fees as a component to research and development expenses 
clinical study costs represent internal costs from personnel  external costs incurred at clinical sites and contracted payments third party clinical research organizations to perform certain clinical trials 
we are obligated to make certain upfront payments upon execution of certain research and developments agreements 
we record these upfront payments as prepaid research and development expenses 
such payments are expensed as services are performed or terms of the respective agreements are achieved 
we accrue research and development expenses for activity as incurred during the fiscal year and prior to receiving invoices from clinical sites and third party clinical research organizations 
we accrue external costs for clinical studies based on the progress of the clinical trials  including patient enrollment  dosing levels of patients enrolled  estimated costs to dose patients  and contracted costs with clinical research organizations and clinical sites 
we record internal costs primarily related to personnel in clinical development  regulatory affairs and biostatistical data analysis and external costs related to non clinical studies and basic research as incurred 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the accrued balance in any accounting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions 
we performed a sensitivity analysis on our accrual for external costs related to our clinical studies as of december  we considered the timing of patient dosing and determined that the effect was immaterial when accruing at enrollment or upon final dosing in comparison to our policy 
we record upfront fees and milestone payments made under our licensing agreements as a research and development expense 
our finished drug inventory is expensed to research and development since we are still a development stage company and we have not received regulatory approval to market rsr after regulatory approval  we will be required to capitalize any future costs of our marketed products at the lower of cost or market 
the timing of future payments for finished drug inventory in relation to the timing of regulatory approval may cause variability in our future cost of goods sold and clinical manufacturing expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures on market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk and all are classified as held to maturity 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  or type of instrument 
the average duration of all of our investments is less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided
