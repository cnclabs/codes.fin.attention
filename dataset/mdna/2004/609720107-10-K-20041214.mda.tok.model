significant accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operation are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the company s consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgment and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed description of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
real estate investments the company applies financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  statement to measure impairment in real estate investments 
rental properties are individually evaluated for impairment when conditions exist which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis without interest from a rental property is less than its historical net cost basis 
these expected future cash flows consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred  rental properties are reduced to their fair value 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time there is a commitment to sell the property and or it is actively being marketed for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less its cost to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded 
page item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation cont d upon acquisition of a property  the company allocates the purchase price of the property based upon the fair value of the assets acquired  which generally consist of land  buildings  leasing commissions and intangible assets  including in place leases and above and below market leases 
the company allocates the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property determined by third party appraisal of the property obtained in conjunction with the purchase 
acquired above and below market leases are valued based on the present value of the difference between prevailing market rates and the in place rates over the remaining lease term 
the purchase price is further allocated to in place lease values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the company s overall relationship with the respective tenant 
acquired above and below market leases are amortized over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the value of in place lease intangibles  which is included as a component of other assets  is amortized to expense over the remaining lease term 
if a tenant terminates its lease early  the unamortized portion of the tenant improvements  leasing commissions above and below market leases and the in place lease value is immediately charged to expense 
securities available for sale investments in non real estate assets consist primarily of marketable securities 
management individually reviews and evaluates our marketable securities for impairment on an annual basis  or when events or circumstances occur 
management considers  among other things  credit aspects of the issuer  amount of decline in fair value over cost and length of time in a continuous loss position 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recognized in earnings and the cost basis of the individual security shall be written down to fair value as the new cost basis 
estimates and revenue recognition estimates are used to establish amounts receivable and revenue from tenants for such things as annualized rents  real estate taxes and other cost recoveries 
in addition  an estimate is made with respect to whether a provision for allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is necessary 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management s estimate of the amounts of the recorded accounts receivable at the balance sheet date that will not be realized from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
if cash receipts in subsequent periods vary from our estimates  or if the company s tenants financial condition deteriorates as a result of operating difficulties  additional changes to the allowance may be required

revised december fin r 
for public entities  fin or fin r is applicable to all special purpose entities spes in which the entity holds a variable interest no later than the end of the first reporting period ending after december   and immediately to all entities created after january  the effective dates of fin r vary depending on the type of reporting enterprise and the type of entity that the enterprise is involved with 
fin and fin r may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
fin and fin r provides guidance on the identification of entities controlled through means other than voting rights 
fin and fin r specifies how a business enterprise should evaluate its involvement in a variable interest entity to determine whether to consolidate that entity 
a variable interest entity must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
conversely  effective dispersion of risks among the parties involved requires that a company that previously consolidated a special purpose entity  upon adoption of fin or fin r  to deconsolidate such entity
