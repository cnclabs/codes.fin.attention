item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the financial statements of the trust are prepared on the following basis a royalty income is recorded when received  including the effect of overtaken or undertaken positions  by the corporate trustee on the last business day of each calendar quarter  and b trust general and administrative expenses are recorded when paid  except for the cash reserved for future general and administrative expenses 
this manner of reporting income and expenses is considered to be the most meaningful because the quarterly distributions to unit holders are based on net cash receipts received from the working interest owners 
the financial statements of the trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  because  under such principles  royalty income and trust general and administrative expenses for a quarter would be recognized on an accrual basis 
in addition  amortization of the net overriding royalty interest  calculated on a units of production basis  is charged directly to trust corpus since such amount does not affect distributable income 
liquidity and capital resources the trust s source of capital is the royalty income received from its share of the net proceeds from the royalty properties 
reference is made to note in the notes to financial statements under item of this form k  which contains certain unaudited supplemental reserve information  for an estimate of future royalty income attributable to the partnership  of which the trust has a interest 
substantial uncertainties exist with regard to future oil and gas prices  which are subject to material fluctuations due to changes in production levels and pricing and other actions taken by major petroleum producing nations  as well as the regional supply and demand for gas  weather  industrial growth  conservation measures  competition and other variables 
in accordance with the provisions of the trust agreement  generally all net proceeds received by the trust  net of trust general and administrative expenses and any cash reserves established for the payment of contingent or future obligations of the trust  are distributed currently to the unit holders 
in  in anticipation of future periods when the cash received from the royalty may not be sufficient for payment of trust expenses  the trust determined  in accordance with the trust agreement  to begin further increasing the trust s cash reserve each quarter 
in the first quarter of  the trust determined that the trust s cash reserve was currently sufficient to provide for future administrative expenses in connection with the winding up of the trust 
the trust determined that a cash reserve equal to three times the average expenses of the trust during each of the past three years was sufficient at this time to provide for future administrative expenses in connection with the winding up of the trust 
the reserve amount at december  and was  and  respectively 
during the first quarter of and the first quarter of  the trust used  and  respectively  from the trust s cash reserve account to pay the trust s general and administrative expenses when insufficient royalty income was received by the trust 
operations the following operational information has been based on information provided to the corporate trustee by chevron as the managing general partner of the partnership and by the applicable working interest owners 
the trustees have no control over these operations or internal controls relating to this information 
years and royalty income increased approximately from  in to  in primarily due to an increase in gas revenues and crude oil and condensate revenues as discussed below 
for  the trust had an undistributed net income of approximately  compared to undistributed net income of approximately  in undistributed net income represents positive net proceeds generated during the period that were applied to an existing loss carryforward 
undistributed net loss represents negative net proceeds generated during the respective period 
an undistributed net loss is carried forward and offset  in future periods  by positive net proceeds earned by the related working interest owner s 
volumes and dollar amounts discussed below represent amounts recorded by the working interest owners unless otherwise specified 
natural gas and gas products gas revenues increased approximately from  in to  in  primarily due to a increase in the average price received for natural gas and gas products from per mcf in to mcf in the increase in gas revenue was also due to a increase in gas volumes from  mcf in to  mcf in the increase in gas volumes were primarily due to new wells on eugene island that came online in march and august  combined with tubing workovers and stimulation on west cameron chevron has recently informed the trustees that it will make downward adjustments to revenues and production based on an improper credit to the trust of revenues and production on eugene island this improper credit relates to production credited from wells in which the trust has no interest from as early as june through october the aggregate amount of these adjustments are expected to be approximately  barrels of oil or  for oil revenues  as well as  mcf or  for gas revenues 
recovery by chevron of these amounts  as well as certain capital expenditures discussed below  will affect royalty income and distributable income in future periods 
the trustees have not had sufficient time to completely evaluate or confirm this information 
the trustees intend to complete a detailed examination and to inquire further with the managing general partner concerning this information as well as to request additional information for the trustees to understand the nature and causes of these anticipated adjustments 
the working interest owners of the ship shoal  east cameron and east cameron properties  respectively  have advised the trust that  as of october   approximately  mcf   mcf and  mcf  respectively  had been overtaken by the working interest owners from these properties 
in addition  chevron  the working interest owner of the eugene island and the west cameron properties  has advised the trust that  as of october   approximately  mcf and  mcf  respectively  had been undertaken by chevron from these properties 
the partnership s share of revenues related to the overtaken gas was included in the partnership s royalty income in the periods during which the gas was sold 
accordingly  the reserves and future royalty income attributable to the partnership  as discussed in the degolyer and macnaughton letter and shown in note in the notes to financial statements have been reduced by the partnership s share of such imbalance 
the standardized measure of discounted future royalty income attributable to the partnership was reduced by approximately  in related to this imbalance 
chevron has advised the trust that it believes sufficient gas reserves exist on eugene island for underproduced parties to recoup their share of the gas imbalance on that property 
during  the working interest owner on the eugene island property settled a gas imbalance on that property for approximately  the trust s share of this settlement amount was approximately  the balance of this amount was recovered from the trust by the working interest owner during crude oil and condensate crude oil and condensate revenues increased approximately from  in to  in  due primarily to a increase in crude oil and condensate volumes from  barrels in to  barrels in additionally  crude oil and condensate prices increased by approximately from in to in operating and capital expenditures operating expenses paid by the working interest owners decreased approximately from  in to  in capital expenditures paid by the working interest owners increased approximately from  in to  in  due primarily to costs associated with drilling the new i well and residual costs to complete the i and i wells on ship shoal in the first quarter  repairs of hurricane lili damages on ship shoal in the second quarter  delineation projects on eugene island for the c and c wells and drilling costs on the f well on ship shoal in the fourth quarter 
chevron has recently informed the trustees that it will make adjustments to capital expenditures to the eugene island and ship shoal properties based on miscalculations and duplications of downward adjustments allocations on ship shoal during the third and fourth quarters of these miscalculations and duplications  which are expected collectively to amount to approximately  are reflected in the amounts above 
recovery of these amounts by chevron will affect royalty income and distributable income in future periods 
the trustees have not had sufficient time to completely evaluate or confirm this information 
the trustees intend to complete a detailed examination and to inquire further with the managing general partner concerning this information as well as to request additional information for the trustees to understand the nature and causes of these adjustments 
special cost escrow account the special cost escrow account is an account of the working interest owners and it is described herein for information purposes only 
the conveyance provides for reserving funds for estimated future special costs of plugging and abandoning wells  dismantling platforms and other costs of abandoning the leases  as well as for the estimated amount of future drilling projects and other capital expenditures on the royalty properties 
as provided in the conveyance  the amount of funds to be reserved is determined based on factors including estimates of aggregate future production costs  aggregate future special costs  aggregate future net revenues and actual current net proceeds 
deposits into this account reduce current distributions and are placed in an escrow account and invested in short term certificates of deposit 
such account is herein referred to as the special cost escrow account 
the trust s share of interest generated from the special cost escrow account  approximately  in  serves to reduce the trust s share of allocated production costs 
special cost escrow account funds will generally be utilized to pay special costs to the extent there are not adequate current net proceeds to pay such costs 
special costs that have been paid are no longer included in the special cost escrow account calculation 
deposits to the special cost escrow account will generally be made when the balance in the special cost escrow account is less than of future special costs and there is a net revenues shortfall a calculation of the excess of estimated future costs over estimated future net revenues pursuant to a formula contained in the conveyance 
when there is not a net revenues shortfall  amounts in the special cost escrow account will generally be released  to the extent that special costs have been paid 
amounts in the special cost escrow account will also be released when the balance in such account exceeds of future special costs 
the discussion of the terms of the conveyance and special cost escrow account contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the conveyance itself  which is an exhibit to this form k and is available upon request from the corporate trustee 
in the first quarter of  there was a net credit of funds to the special cost escrow account of approximately  in  the working interest owners deposited a net amount of  into the special cost escrow account 
the deposit was made primarily due to an increase in the estimate of projected capital expenditures  production costs and abandonment costs of the royalty properties 
as of december   approximately  remained in the special cost escrow account 
in  the working interest owners released a net amount to the trust of  from the special cost escrow account 
the release was made primarily due to a decrease in the estimate of projected capital expenditures  production costs and abandonment costs of the royalty properties 
as of december   approximately  remained in the special cost escrow account 
in  the working interest owners released a net amount to the trust of  from the special cost escrow account 
the release was made primarily due to a decrease in the estimate of projected capital expenditures  production costs and abandonment costs of the royalty properties 
as of december   approximately  remained in the special cost escrow account 
additional deposits to the special cost escrow account may be required in future periods in connection with other production costs  other abandonment costs  other capital expenditures and changes in the estimates and factors described above 
such deposits could result in a significant reduction in royalty income in the periods in which such deposits are made 
summary by property listed below is a summary of operations as compared to of the four principal royalty properties based on gross revenues generated during these periods combined 
eugene island eugene island crude oil revenues increased approximately  from  in to  in primarily due to increases in both prices and production 
crude oil production increased from  barrels in to  barrels in the average price of crude oil increased from per barrel in to per barrel in gas revenues increased approximately  from  in to  in primarily due to an increase in the average price received for natural gas from per mcf in to in  along with an increase in gas production from  mcf in to  mcf in capital expenditures increased from  in to  in primarily due to delineation projects during the fourth quarter 
operating expenses decreased from  in to  in chevron has advised the trust that the foregoing comparison does not give effect to an improper credit of revenues and production and a miscalculation of capital expenditures that will be allocated during the first quarter of and recovered by chevron during that period and in subsequent periods 
the aggregate amount of these adjustments for improper credits of production and revenues from as early as june through october are expected to be approximately  barrels of oil or  for oil revenues  as well as  mcf or  for gas revenues 
the comparison above is included without adjustment as royalty income for these periods was calculated and paid based on these amounts 
as discussed under item in description of the royalty properties reserves  the working interest owner has advised the trust that as of october   there was an undertake imbalance position of approximately  mcf  mcf net to the trust on this property
