business overview overall  fiscal was a challenging year for the company in terms of sales 
as the company entered  the retail economy remained soft  a war with iraq was imminent  the company s sales trends from continued to be difficult  and the company made a significant change in its merchandising organization with the appointment of a new chief merchandising officer 
given these factors  the company continued to maintain tight control over its expenses and for the third consecutive year made further reductions in planned inventory levels to protect gross margins 
total inventories at year end were million versus million at the end of  and on a square foot basis fiscal year end inventories were down in the company s us women s apparel stores 
at the same time  overall product gross margin improved by approximately basis points  due to an increase in markon  offset partially by higher markdowns 
this lean inventory strategy  however  which protected the company on the downside  began to limit its ability to drive sales when the economy began to recover in the second half of the year  particularly impacting fourth quarter sales and net income 
fourth quarter sales and net income were also impacted by lower markdown selling 
the company believes this was partially due to the company s end of season sale event having reduced levels of inventory available on a square foot basis and compounded by reduced customer demand for the goods included in the sale event 
the company ended the year with notes payable of zero and long term debt at million 
cash flow from operations was very strong  at million for the year  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales in fiscal one of the company s key initiatives in fiscal is to increase its inventory levels  reflecting its plan for stronger demand 
in fiscal  the company is also increasing its investment in advertising over levels  including national tv and print advertising  which is expected to add to sales momentum during key selling periods 
the company opened a total of new stores in fiscal  with expansion in all concepts 
among these openings was the retail launch of talbots mens  with three stores opened in the spring and three stores opened in the fall 
the company also opened its first talbots collection store  which features a more fashion forward  upper layer assortment 
the company will move ahead cautiously in its evaluation of these test concepts  but believes both may represent future growth opportunities for talbots 
looking at the full fiscal year  the company is currently planning to open a total of approximately new stores  with growth planned in each concept  which would represent approximately square footage growth 
the company also updated many of its existing stores in fiscal the company believes that it is critical  even in a soft economy  to maintain its stores at the highest level  and the company typically refurbishes each of its stores every three to five years 
the company s capital expenditures for fiscal totaled approximately million  with more than of this capital spending for store expansion and store renovations 
the balance was for various mis initiatives and infrastructure upgrades 
other areas of growth in fiscal included the company s online business  which increased over fiscal and represented approximately of total catalog sales  up from in fiscal further  the

additionally  the company saw growth in finance charge income associated with the increase in customer accounts receivable 
interest expense  net  decreased by million to million in compared to million in interest expense decreased by million to million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to a combination of declining interest rates and slightly lower borrowing levels

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the nature of the company s business is to have two distinct selling seasons  spring and fall 
the first and second quarters make up the spring season and the third and fourth quarters make up the fall season 
within the spring season  catalog sales are stronger in the first quarter  while retail store sales are slightly stronger in the second quarter 
within the fall season  catalog sales are generally stronger in the fourth quarter except in when the third quarter came in stronger 
this was partially due to weaker than anticipated performance in the fourth quarter sale event from low inventory levels 
retail store sales are the strongest in the fourth quarter 
the following table sets forth certain items in the company s unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of net sales 
the information as to any one quarter is not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal quarter ended may  august  november  january  net sales cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income fiscal quarter ended may  august  november  february  net sales cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income the company s merchandising strategy focuses on liquidating seasonal inventory at the end of each selling season 
generally  the company achieves this by conducting major sale events at the end of the second and fourth quarters 
these events produce an increase in sales volume  however  since marking down the value of inventory increases expense  the company s cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses as a percentage of net sales is increased 
merchandise inventories typically peak in the third quarter 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are strongly affected by the seasonality of sales 
the two key elements of this seasonality are the catalog circulation strategy  which affects catalog sales volume and produces commensurately high catalog production costs and the major semiannual sale events  which require additional store payroll and selling supplies 
another factor is the store expansion 
table of contents program  which results in having more stores open in the fall than at the beginning of the year and  therefore  results in higher store payroll and operations related expenses 
the combined effect of the patterns of net sales  cost of sales  buying and occupancy expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  described above  has produced higher operating income margins  as a percent of sales  in the first and third quarters 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operating activities and a line of credit facility from five banks  with maximum available short term borrowings of million 
at january  and february   the company had no amounts outstanding under this facility 
the company s working capital needs are typically at their lowest during the spring season and peak during the fall selling season

net income in was million lower than in additionally  operating cash flows were negatively impacted by changes in income tax accruals and deferred income taxes  due to the reduced level of net income and the timing of depreciation deductions 
this was partially offset by the change in customer accounts receivable as the balance increased at a lower rate in compared to the company recognized increased usage of the talbots charge card in  however  it has also recognized an increase in the rate of customer account repayments 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities over was primarily attributable to the change in customer accounts receivable and the timing of receipts and payments of merchandise inventories 
customer accounts receivables increased at a lower rate in than this was primarily due to the national rollout of the company s classic awards customer loyalty program in early  which was supported by in store promotion and advertising 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was also due to the company s continued focus on managing inventory levels 
throughout  inventory levels and accounts payable balances were maintained at lower levels than previous years  benefiting cash flows 
other positive adjustments to operating cash flow relate to the increase in general accruals and liabilities booked in the normal course of operations including accrued taxes  pension and other retirement plan liabilities and general accruals 
partially offsetting these positive trends was a decrease of million in net income 
cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in  consisting entirely of investments in property  plant and equipment

the company s primary on going cash requirements will be to fund new stores and the expansions  renovations and relocations of existing stores  expansion of the company s corporate facility  to finance working capital build ups during peak selling seasons  to pay cash dividends that may be declared from time to time and to repurchase the company s common stock 
for the current fiscal year and next fiscal year  the company believes its cash flows from operating activities and funds available to it under credit facilities will be sufficient to meet its planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements  including its debt service payments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements require the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  retirement plans  allowance for doubtful accounts and income taxes 
the estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results would differ from these estimates if actual events or experience were different from their assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
however  there is no assurance that such judgments and estimates will reflect actual results or that such estimates or their underlying assumptions may not need to change materially in the future to reflect actual experience 
inventory markdown reserve 
merchandise inventory is a significant portion of the company s balance sheet  representing approximately of total assets at january  talbots manages its inventory levels by holding four major sale events a year in its stores and catalog  consisting of two mid season sales and two end of season clearance sales 
no other major promotional sale events are typically held 
these events serve to liquidate remaining inventory at the end of each selling season after which remaining goods are transferred to 
table of contents the company s outlet stores 
at the end of each reporting period reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining markdown inventory 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of markdown inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns on this same merchandise based on historical markdown percentages 
these percentages are reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 
if market conditions were to decline or customer acceptance of product is not favorable  talbots might be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  possibly resulting in an incremental charge to earnings 
management believes that at january  and february   the markdown reserve was reasonable based on current markdown inventory levels  historical markdown trends and reasonable sales and markdown forecasts 
sales return reserve 
as part of the normal sales cycle  the company receives customer merchandise returns through both its catalog and store locations 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels and projected future return levels 
the sales return reserve calculation consists of two separate components 
the stores component is based on an analysis that tracks daily sales over the preceding six months and actual returns processed against those sales 
a six month rolling average return rate is applied against the actual sales and the difference between the estimated returns and actual returns is booked as a reserve 
the model also applies a component to reduce the reserve for returns that result in merchandise exchanges 
these types of returns are tracked by the store systems and the estimate is applied against the return reserve 
the catalog component is based on a similar process except that sales are tracked by catalog and return rates are based on forecasted estimates for the entire life of the catalog and are based on current and historical return experience 
periodically both components of the calculation are validated by comparing the assumptions used to the actual returns processed 
management believes that at january  and february   the reserve was sufficient based on current sales return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
the company records store generated revenue at the point of sale and catalog and online revenue based on estimated receipt by the customer 
customer loyalty program 
talbots maintains a customer loyalty program in which customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching a specified purchase level on their talbots charge accounts 
customers may redeem their appreciation awards toward future merchandise purchases on the talbots charge card 
appreciation awards  by their terms  expire one year from the date of issuance 
typically  the customer receives one point for each of purchase 
each time a customer reaches points within the program year the customer is issued a appreciation award 
in fiscal and the company ran two promotional events each year where the customer was credited points for each purchased 
appreciation award expense is calculated as a percent of talbots charge sales and is based on expected redemption rates and is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
on going analysis of issuances and redemptions is performed to identify trends in the redemption rate 
a secondary analysis is performed that analyzes the accrual account balance and factors in the outstanding unredeemed awards  actual redemptions and the level of award points earned 
adjustments are made to the accrual based on trends and changes in the program 
several key statistics are monitored regularly  including expense as a percent of sales  redemptions as a percentage of sales and cumulative redemptions 
trends in these statistics are then factored into both the initial expense and the analysis of the liability account 
actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could result in additional expense 
management believes that at january  and february   its current accrual was sufficient based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 

table of contents retirement plans 
the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all full time employees  a non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan serp for certain key executives impacted by internal revenue code limits  and provides certain medical benefits for most retired employees under a postretirement medical plan 
in calculating its retirement plan obligations and related expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates 
the annual determination of expense involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to plan participants and allocates this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
the plans are valued annually as of december st 
significant assumptions related to the calculation of the company s obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan  the average rate of compensation increase by certain plan participants and the assumed healthcare trend rates on the postretirement medical plan 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based in part on an analysis of corporate bonds with maturities matched to the plans anticipated cash flows 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the company s obligation and net expense 
at december  and  the discount rate used was and  respectively 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s obligations are decreased or increased  accordingly 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on an analysis using ibbotson associates historical investment returns data for the two major classes of investments in which the company invests debt and equity securities 
this rate is utilized primarily in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than or more than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this loss or gain adjusts future pension expense over approximately years 
during and  the company utilized as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is based on historical and expected compensation increases 
the company utilized a rate of for the period beginning december  and for the period beginning december  this rate is utilized principally in calculating the retirement obligation and annual expense 
the assumed health care expense trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement medical plan 
the healthcare cost escalation rate is used to determine the postretirement obligation and annual expense 
at december  and  the company used and as initial cost escalation rates that gradually trends down to 
to the extent that these rates increase or decrease  the company s obligation and associated expense are decreased or increased  accordingly 
at december  and  the company believes that the assumptions used in the calculation of its retirement plans and postretirement medical plan liabilities were reasonable based on current market conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer accounts receivable consist entirely of outstanding receivables from the company s customers for purchases made using the company s proprietary credit card 
talbots maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts providing for estimated charge offs resulting from the inability of talbots charge customers to make required payments 
delinquent accounts are generally charged off automatically after a period of delinquency 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
increases in the allowance are charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
the likelihood of collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors including the level of accounts receivable balances  overall credit quality of the portfolio  historic charge off levels and projected future charge off levels 

table of contents an analytical review of accounts receivable is performed each reporting period  which categorizes delinquent accounts based on the number of days overdue 
bad debt estimates  by category  are then calculated based on historical collection rates 
for accounts that are not delinquent  a bad debt rate is imputed based on historical delinquency and collection rates 
in addition  bad debts resulting from factors other than delinquency  such as bankruptcy or fraud  are also factored into the calculation based on historical experience 
existing accounts are reviewed twice a year using standard industry credit score models by an independent credit scoring agency 
an adjustment to the reserve is calculated based on movement in the portfolio s credit scores and current aging trends 
if the creditworthiness of talbots customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additions to this reserve might be required 
management believes that at january  and february   the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was reasonable in light of portfolio balance  portfolio quality  historical charge offs and reasonable charge off forecasts 
income taxes 
the company is routinely under audit by various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
in response to this  management records accruals for estimates of audit adjustments by the taxing authorities 
the eventual resolution of these audits might include increases or decreases in liabilities
