item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our long range plans still include developing additional inns and expanding existing jameson inns as suitable opportunities arise 
we also continue to sell underperforming jameson and signature inns which no longer meet our investment criteria 
see policies and objectives with respect to certain activities dispositions 
during we sold one jameson inn and one signature inn which were mostly under performing and which no longer met our investment criteria 
at year end  three inns were held for sale 
since we have relinquished our reit status and acquired kitchin hospitality  we plan to use the cash that would otherwise be paid out in dividends on our common stock and any additional cash flow resulting from our ownership of kitchin hospitality to pay down long term indebtedness and to finance any expansion and renovation projects that we believe are appropriate 
we also continue to consider other strategic alternatives as a possible means of growth and increasing shareholder value 
these include acquisitions of other properties  business combinations  an offering of additional equity securities  entry into additional long term debt financings  engaging in related lines of new business such as licensing or franchising the use of our trademarked names or operating hotel properties owned by third persons and other alternatives 
we have made no decisions or commitments at this time  but we intend to continue to consider these alternatives 
internal growth 
due primarily to anticipated increases in the demand for hospitality services projected by some industry experts and professional observers  we are focusing on increasing revenue per available room  or revpar  between one and five percent for we will benefit from increases in room revenues generated through increases in occupancy rates and average daily room rates or adr of the inns 
we practice market sensitive pricing  increasing and decreasing room rates at particular inns as market conditions in the specific communities warrant or require 
the inns general managers receive a portion of their compensation based on achieving specified quarterly operating results 
raising equity capital 
we are currently considering raising equity capital through an offering of additional common stock as a means of reducing leverage and strengthening our balance sheet 
development of new inns 
we believe that selective opportunities may still exist for the development of new jameson inns in certain markets in the southeastern united states 
although we have no current plans to begin new development of jameson inns  we will continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise in targeted communities 
at december   we had no inns under expansion 
we have entered into agreements with best western under which three signature inns are being operated as best western signature inns 
we may consider other re flagging opportunities in the future although we have no obligation to do so 

table of contents expansion of existing jameson inns 
we expanded one jameson inn in january we may consider expanding additional existing jameson inns if market conditions and other circumstances warrant although we currently do not have plans to do so in since jameson inns built prior to were initially constructed with the office and lobby  swimming pool and fitness center on sites generally large enough for future expansions  the incremental cost per room of expansions is lower than for new inn construction 
accordingly  we have expanded jameson inns in markets that had strong room demand 
also  as compared to the development of new inns  expansion of existing jameson inns has been a relatively lower risk growth strategy since we have an opportunity to assess local room demand and market trends based on our direct experience in developing and owning the existing hotel 
we employ substantially the same strategy regarding possible expansion of our currently operating exterior corridor jameson inns 
the sites for new  interior corridor jameson inns  however  and all of the current signature inn sites are fully developed and these properties cannot be expanded 
sales and marketing 
in our marketing efforts  we will focus on local efforts directed to the business community in the city or town where the particular inn is located 
one of the key responsibilities of an inn s general manager is to make sales calls on local chambers of commerce  businesses  factories  government installations and colleges and universities 
the goal of the sales call is to familiarize local business people with the inn in their community and solicit their recommendation of the inn to business travelers visiting communities where inns are located  including both individual discretionary travelers as well as groups attending family or community events 
we own billboards and utilize other similar types of advertising and have our own call center with numbers to facilitate reservations for the inns 
all jameson inns and signatures have direct links to global distribution systems gds for reservations which also interface with major electronic reservation systems 
this interface connects the inns with travel agents nationally and internationally 
in addition to billboard advertising which has been traditionally utilized and which we will continue to utilize  we place advertisements for the inns in regional and special event publications and in newspapers 
we also market the inns through our website www 
jamesoninns 
com 
competition 
the hotel industry remains highly competitive 
each of our inns is located in an area that has competing hotels 
the number of competitive hotels in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy  adr  and revpar of the inns 
many of our inns are located in cities and communities in which significant new hotel and motel development has occurred in recent years 
the inns compete mainly on the basis of price  quality and perceived value 
competition for the inns is made up primarily of limited service hotels in the southeastern and midwestern united states operating under national franchises  many of which have greater financial resources than we do  substantial advertising budgets  national reservation systems  marketing programs  guest reward programs and greater name recognition 
regulations environmental matters 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly remediate such property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using the real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
while we have not incurred any such costs in connection with our inns or land parcels  we may be potentially liable for such costs 
we are not aware of any potential material liability or claims for which we may be responsible 
however  we cannot be certain that there are no material claims or liabilities related to real property which we own  future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on us  or the current environmental condition of the inns will not be affected by their operations  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the inns such as the presence of underground storage tanks or by third parties 

table of contents we believe that the inns are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and do not anticipate that we will be required in the foreseeable future to expend any material amounts in order to comply with such ordinances and regulations 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  and are not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of our present or former properties 
americans with disabilities act 
under the americans with disabilities act of or the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
in addition to remedial costs  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
we believe that all existing inns are substantially in compliance with these requirements and we intend to construct future inns in accordance with such requirements as well 
we have engaged disabilities consultants at various times to make recommendations regarding compliance of the inns with the ada 
these consultants submitted reports recommending a number of improvements for access to and use by disabled persons with respect to certain of the inns in operation  which improvements were made 
we have also incorporated the consultants recommendations into the construction of new jameson inns and plan to do so in the future 
employees at december   prior to our acquisition of kitchin hospitality  we employed persons who were also employees of kitchin hospitality 
under the cost reimbursement agreement between jameson and kitchin hospitality  we reimbursed kitchin hospitality for the time and for other general and administrative costs that these shared employees spent on our business 
for the year ended december   our reimbursement to kitchin hospitality totaled approximately  due to our acquisition of kitchin hospitality  we now employ approximately  full and part time employees who are engaged in day to day operations of the inns 
none of our employees is represented by a union or labor organization  nor have our operations ever been interrupted by a work stoppage 
we consider relations with our employees to be excellent 
policies and objectives with respect to certain activities the following is a discussion of our investment objectives and policies  financing policies and policies with respect to certain other activities 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the sole discretion of our board of directors 
we can give no assurance that we will attain our investment objectives or that the value of jameson will not decrease 
investment objectives and policies 
our investment objective is to improve our earnings and return on equity by deploying all of our available capital into debt repayment and hotel development and operations 
we will seek to accomplish these objectives through the ownership and operation of the inns  increases in the inns room revenues and selective development and expansion of inns 
for related disclosures  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently intend to invest only in inns as well as our billboards  although we may also hold temporary cash investments from time to time pending investment 
we may purchase or lease properties for long term investment  expand and improve properties  or sell such properties  in whole or in part  when circumstances warrant 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness which have priority over our equity interest 
dispositions 
during  we sold one room jameson inn and one room signature inn 
two additional jameson inns and one additional signature inn were classified as held for sale at december  we may identify additional inns to dispose of which do not meet our investment criteria 
we do not expect the combined sales of these properties to result in a significant gain or loss 
financing 
our policy has been to finance all of the costs of developing new inns and expanding existing inns 
indebtedness we incur may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured and unsecured  and publicly and privately placed debt instruments 
indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of our inns or may be limited to 
table of contents the inn to which the indebtedness relates 
we may also use the proceeds from any of our borrowings for working capital  to refinance existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions  expansions or development of new inns 
most of our current mortgage indebtedness is with recourse to us 
at december   we had outstanding an aggregate of approximately million of mortgage debt 
in addition  kitchin hospitality has a million credit facility that jameson has assumed and that has availability through the loan maturity in may while our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur  we currently have a policy of limiting outstanding indebtedness for new construction  expansions and refinancings to of the aggregate value of the inns based on the most recent appraisals obtained on the inns 
our board of directors could change our current policies and we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements 
this increase could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may attempt to raise additional equity capital for working capital purposes  the repayment of indebtedness or the redemption of our outstanding preferred stock 
in the event we desire to raise additional equity capital  our board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of jameson common stock or other capital stock of jameson in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
existing stockholders would have no preemptive right to purchase shares issued in any offering  and any such offering might cause a dilution of a stockholder s investment in jameson 
working capital reserves 
our policy is to maintain working capital reserves and when not sufficient  access to borrowings in amounts that our board of directors determines to be adequate to meet normal contingencies in connection with the operation of our business and investments 
policy regarding capital expenditures 
in july  we adopted a policy of maintaining cash or sufficient access to borrowings equal to of the jameson inns aggregate room revenues since july   less amounts actually spent from that date forward for capital expenditures 
this policy extends to the signature inns acquired in may for the period july  through december   our actual expenditures for these purposes exceed these amounts as of room revenues equal million and we expended million on items during that same period 
the amount actually expended represents of aggregate room revenue since july  other policies 
we intend to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of we do not intend to invest in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such issuer  underwrite securities of other issuers or actively trade in loans or other investments 
we may make investments other than as previously described  although we presently have no plans to do so 
conflicts of interest 
because of thomas w 
kitchin s ownership of kitchin hospitality prior to january  and his position with jameson  there were inherent conflicts of interest in the construction of new jameson inns and signature inns and the expansion  refurbishment and other capital expenditures relating to existing inns by kitchin hospitality 
it is our current intention that we will no longer enter into any contracts with any company owned by thomas w 
kitchin 
conflicts of interest also existed in our dealings with kitchin hospitality under the master leases and under the cost reimbursement agreement between the two companies 
these conflicts of interest were eliminated upon our acquisition of kitchin hospitality 
under the rules of the nasdaq national market  transactions between us and one or more of our directors  officers  shareholders or any member of such person s immediate family  or between us and any other entity which a director has a financial interest must be approved by our audit committee or another independent body of the board of directors

overview from through december   we were a real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
on january   we acquired kitchin hospitality  llc and relinquished our status as a reit 
with the closing of the acquisition  kitchin hospitality became our wholly owned subsidiary and we now both own and operate our inns 
as of december   we owned jameson inn hotels and signature inn hotels  all of which were classified as being within the economy and mid scale segments of the lodging industry 
we did not purchase or build any hotels in  but we did expand one existing jameson inn in january during  all of our hotels were leased to kitchin hospitality  llc under certain master leases pursuant to which we received rental payments  which were our only substantive source of revenues 
in addition to our ownership of our hotels  we also own billboards and other related assets 
the billboards were leased to kitchin hospitality  llc and to other parties  and the rental revenues were our sole source of revenue from these properties 
although room revenues in were earned by our lessee  kitchin hospitality  not by us  they are the basis upon which the percentage rent earned by us until december  under the master leases was determined 
room revenues in were affected by a number of factors  including a weak economy generally  reduced business and leisure travel  the conflict in iraq  terrorist threat assessments and national security alert levels  regional and local economic factors  the retail price of oil and gasoline  oversupply of rooms in specific markets  the effects of penetration over the last several years by competitors into certain secondary and tertiary markets in which we have historically operated and direct competition as to room rates 
in  room rental revenues will be received directly by us  and we will bear all of the hotel operating and administrative costs and expenses 
these revenues and expenses were previously received and incurred by kitchin hospitality 
as a result of our relinquishment of our status as a reit in  we are now a tax paying entity and are no longer entitled to a deduction for dividends and other distributions to our stockholders 

table of contents key performance indicator the master leases provided for the payment by kitchin hospitality to us of base rent and percentage rent 
for the year ended december   we earned a combined base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million from the jameson inns master leases and million from the signature inns master leases 
the principal determinant of percentage rent under the master leases was the room revenues of our inns 
the primary financial indicator of our performance is our revpar revenue per available room and the factors contributing to it  such as our occupancy rate and our average daily room rate 
control of our operational and administrative expenses will also be an important aspect or our business since we are now operating our inns  but many of the operational expenses will vary in proportion to the number of rooms that we operate 
thus  we believe that the results of our efforts to grow revpar will be the single most important factor in determining our future financial performance 
based on information from several observers of our industry and our recent experience  we expect demand for hospitality services to increase during as a result  we expect revpar growth of between and in due primarily to an expected increase in business travel 
our hotels  along with the other lodging companies  were negatively impacted in due to the weak economy in the first half of the year 
management s priorities our highest priority for is revpar growth 
in addition  for  our other principal priorities include the strengthening of our balance sheet and the re branding of our signature inn hotels 
we also intend to consider other strategic alternatives as a possible means of growth and increasing shareholder value 
these include acquisitions of other properties  business combinations  corporate restructuring  redemption of our preferred stock  entry into additional long term debt financings  engaging in related lines of new business  such as licensing or franchising the use of our trademarked names or operating hotel properties owned by third persons and other alternatives 
we have made no decisions or commitments at this time  but we intend to continue to consider any of these alternatives 
our long range plan is to grow the jameson inn brand as opportunities for growth become available which may include  among other things  new development or franchising of the brand 
results of operations the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the years indicated 
year ended december combined jameson and signature brands occupancy rate adr revpar room rentals s other inn revenues s room nights available operating inns at period end rooms available at period end including amounts related to discontinued operations 

table of contents comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december for fiscal  we earned base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million compared with million for this relatively flat result was due to a slight increase in our overall occupancy rate  which was mostly offset by slight decreases in our average daily rate and number of available rooms in due  in the latter case  to the sales of one signature inn and one jameson inn  offset by the addition of one new jameson inn expansion during 
billboard revenues also were essentially flat for we believe that the weak economy and the lingering effects of terrorist actions world wide continued to negatively impact us and our industry in general during our property and other taxes and our insurance expenses in increased a total of million  or  compared to primarily due to increased rates and premiums in and the effects of a one time reduction in our franchise taxes in resulting from a  refund 
our depreciation expense decreased to million from million in due primarily to the decrease in capital additions in recent years 
our general and administrative expense includes an allocation of salary  office overhead and other general and administrative costs of the corporate office 
we share employees and office space with kitchin hospitality 
our general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in due to additional time spent by shared employees in our business matters as compared to kitchin hospitality s 
for and future years  all of the general and administrative expense historically incurred by kitchin hospitality will be reported by us on a consolidated basis with the expenses incurred by us  so there will be no similar allocations in the future 
we incurred acquisition expenses of approximately million consisting of professional fees investment banking  legal  and accounting in connection with our acquisition of kitchin hospitality  llc and a shareholder lawsuit settlement in we do not anticipate any further acquisition expenses directly related to this acquisition or shareholder lawsuit settlement in the purchase consideration of the acquisition of million  together with the excess of liabilities assumed over assets acquired of million  will be expensed in january as lease termination costs 
during we experienced a positive net impact on our earnings of approximately  as a result of the sale of two inns and a tract of land  compared with a net gain of approximately  upon the sale of five inns  and a tract of land in our interest expense decreased from million in to million in this was the result of the weighted average interest rate on our debt of during compared to during our net principal balance of our outstanding debt was reduced million during our income from discontinued operations  before impairment charges and gains on disposal  decreased slightly to  in compared to  in we report as discontinued operations assets held for sale and assets sold in the current period 
discontinued operations for also include a  impairment charge related to two inns held for sale at december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december for fiscal  we earned base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million 
our lease revenue for decreased  as compared to due to the following factors lease revenues earned from the signature inns decreased  in versus due to a decline in occupancy rate  as well as a slight decrease of room nights available in as a result of the sale of one signature inn during in  all that was earned from the signature inns was base rent 
lease revenues earned from the jameson inns increased  due to a slight increase in the average daily rate compared to  offset somewhat by a decline in the occupancy rate 
one new jameson inn was opened in  and five new jameson inns were opened during the increase in the number of rooms due to the opening of new inns was offset partially by the sale of three jameson inns during additionally  lease revenue earned from billboards decreased  in due to the sale of certain billboards in connection with inn sales during and 
table of contents a soft us economy during along with the continuing effect of the september  terrorist attacks negatively impacted travel and demand for hotel rooms generally 
our property and other taxes expenses totaled million in  compared with million for the decrease of  is attributable primarily to a  refund received in that resulted in a one time reduction of expense in  as property taxes were relatively flat compared to our insurance expenses totaled million in  compared with  for the increase is attributable to increased costs associated with the year end renewal of our property and liability insurance which was adversely affected by the impact to the insurance markets of the september  terrorist attacks 
our depreciation expense remained relatively constant at million compared to million in our net operating inns decreased by three but this was offset by the depreciation of several inn expansions and capital expenditures on the inns 
our general and administrative expenses include an allocation of salary  office overhead and other general and administrative costs of the corporate office 
we shared employees and office space with kitchin hospitality 
our general and administrative expenses for increased to million as compared to million in due to additional time spent by shared employees in our business matters as compared to kitchin hospitality s  and an increase in other professional fees 
during we experienced a positive net impact on our earnings of approximately  with respect to properties sold 
this was comprised of a net gain of  upon the sale of four inns  and a net gain of  in connection with the sale of a tract of land 
during we experienced a negative net impact on our earnings of approximately  with respect to properties sold or held for sale 
this consisted of a  impairment loss related to seven inns  a net gain of  upon the sale of five other inns  and a net gain of  in connection with the sale of a tract of land 
our interest expense decreased from million in to million in this was the result of the weighted average interest rate on our debt of during compared to during our net principal balance of our outstanding debt was reduced million during our income from discontinued operations  before gains on disposal  increased to  in compared to  in we now report as discontinued operations assets held for sale and assets sold in the current period 
funds from operations and ebitda supplemental non gaap information we believe ffo and ebitda to be meaningful non gaap measures of operating performance 
however  they should not be considered alternatives to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we calculate ffo for all periods consistent with the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc definition 
ffo has been calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders before depreciation expense and gains or losses on disposal of depreciable real estate assets 
however  ffo as presented in this table may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
ebitda is defined as income before interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization 
restructuring and other special items and gains and losses on asset dispositions and impairments are also excluded from ebitda as these items do not impact operating results on a recurring basis 
we consider ebitda to be one measure of the cash flows from our operations before debt service that provides a relevant basis for comparison  and ebitda is presented to assist investors and lenders in analyzing performance 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  nor should it be considered as an indicator of our overall financial performance

liquidity and capital resources historically  as a reit  we were required to distribute to stockholders at least of our taxable income  excluding net capital gains 
the termination of our status as a reit eliminated this requirement  beginning in however  by relinquishing our status as a reit  we are subject to payment of income taxes 
in addition  due to the acquisition of kitchin hospitality  llc on january   we are now exposed to greater business risks  including the seasonal cash flow related to the operation of hotels 
sources and uses of cash 
our net cash provided by operations was million in our other principal sources of liquidity are existing cash on hand of million at december   the remaining availability under the line of credit million at december   proceeds from the refinancing of inns with increased borrowing capacity  and net proceeds from the sale of inns and land held for sale 
these funds are used to meet the principal repayments of our amortizing debt  the refurbishing costs and capital maintenance of our existing inns  and certain other cash requirements including the payment of preferred dividends and other operating expenses 
our net cash used in investing activities for totaled  we received net cash proceeds totaling million from the sale of two inns and a parcel of land 
proceeds from these asset sales were primarily used to retire debt 
we had an agreement to sell three inns at december  that closed during the first quarter of  and we may sell additional inns in the future 
additions to property and equipment totaled million for as compared to million in included in additions to property and equipment are capital 
table of contents expenditures for refurbishing and renovating existing inns of approximately million for compared to million for we plan to spend million during on refurbishment and renovation projects of existing inns 
these expenditures exceed our minimum policy of of inn room revenues  which we commit to spend for capital improvements and the refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment at our inns 
these capital expenditures are funded from operating cash flow  net proceeds from the disposition of under performing hotels and possibly additional borrowings 
we anticipate this trend to continue during as we refurbish our existing inns to ensure their competitiveness in the market 
these capital expenditures are in addition to amounts spent on normal repairs and maintenance expense 
our net cash used in financing activities during totaled million 
this amount included the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders of million  net proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan of  proceeds from mortgage notes net of repayments and related deferred finance costs of  and scheduled long term debt payments of million 
we have historically financed construction of new jameson inns entirely with bank borrowings 
we continue to consider possible additional long term debt or equity financing that would be available to fund any future development activities 
debt structure 
at december  the company had total indebtedness of million compared to million at december  of that  approximately million is variable rate debt adjustable during as follows adjustment date amount in millions weighted average interest rate january february march april may july september october adjusts daily total during the weighted average interest rate on our debt was compared to during we anticipate full year required principal repayments of approximately million 
we have million of scheduled principal payments and maturing loans for including letters of credit aggregating million that expire on december  which are secured by two of our signature inns at december  this excludes million that will be repaid upon the closing of the sale of two of our inns in early in addition  we have classified a million mortgage secured by one signature inn in the scheduled aggregate principal payments as we are in violation of a debt service coverage ratio loan covenant 
based on our discussions with representatives of the lender  we anticipate the lender will amend this covenant or provide a waiver of this technical violation in early there are nine other mortgage loans  along with our line of credit  which mature during we expect to be able to make our regularly scheduled debt payments out of our available cash flow 
we also expect to refinance with the same lenders those loans that are scheduled to mature in based on our preliminary discussions with these lenders we believe we will be successful in obtaining replacement financing at renewal terms satisfactory to us 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total inflation operators of hotels in general possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
nevertheless  competitive pressures have limited kitchin hospitality  and may in the future limit us  in the ability to raise rates in the face of inflation 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
impairment of real estate assets we review long lived assets for indicators of impairment at least quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of our property may be impaired 
if indicators are present  we project the expected future results of operations of the asset based on our estimates on future budgeted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and use growth assumptions to project these amounts over the expected life of the underlying asset 
our growth assumptions are based on assumed future changes in the economy and changes in demand for lodging in our markets  if actual conditions differ from those in our assumptions  the actual results of each asset s actual future operations could be significantly different from the estimated results we used in our analysis 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from expected future results estimated to be generated by those assets  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
impairment losses are based on the difference between the book value of each individual property and the related estimated fair value of each property 
in and  we recognized  million and million  respectively  of impairment losses 
we did not recognize any impairment losses during in the event assumptions used to perform our review are inappropriate  the carrying value of these properties and our operating results would be misstated 
overhead allocation from kitchin hospitality kitchin hospitality operates all of our inns and pays all of our salaries and administrative overhead expenses pursuant to the cost reimbursement agreement 
the overhead allocation pursuant to the cost reimbursement agreement involves a substantial number of estimates pertaining to the allocation between entities of employee s time and various other costs 
kitchin hospitality charged us   and  in  and  respectively of allocated salaries  office overhead and other general and administrative costs pursuant to the cost reimbursement agreement 
we expensed approximately   and  of the allocated costs in  and  respectively 
the remainder represented capitalizable property and equipment costs 
historically  a significant portion of the overhead expense was charged by kitchin hospitality for the development of new inns 
in the event that the assumptions used to determine the overhead allocation were incorrect  we would not expense an appropriate amount for such services 
as a result of our acquisition of kitchin hospitality in january of  we will report in the future all of the salaries and administrative overhead incurred by us and all of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 

table of contents investment in real estate assets our management is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our depreciable assets 
we consider the period of future benefit of the asset to determine the appropriate useful life 
these assessments have a direct impact on our operating results 
the estimated useful lives of our assets by class are as follows land improvements years buildings years furniture  fixtures and equipment years billboards years in the event that management uses inappropriate useful lives or methods for depreciation  our operating results would be misstated 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a significant portion of our existing indebtedness is subject to adjustable interest rates primarily with twelve month interest rate readjustment dates  and is secured by our inns and billboards 
because of the current cost and relative unavailability of fixed interest rate long term financing  we anticipate that the majority of our future borrowings will continue to be at interest rates which adjust with certain indices 
therefore  our costs of financing our floating rate debt may increase subject to events beyond our direct control 
our variable rate debt consists primarily of individual property mortgages that adjust one time per year at varying dates for a twelve month period following the interest rate adjustment date 
a hypothetical basis point change on january  in the indices underlying our floating rate debt would have changed our annual interest expense by approximately million based on the weighted average borrowings subject to variable rates during however  the actual annual impact to interest expense would have been less than million due to the various annual interest rate readjustment dates of our variable rate debt 
we expect to selectively obtain financial instruments  including interest rate cap agreements  to limit our exposure to increases in short term interest rates 
additional information regarding this  to the extent that it is relevant to our business  is included in item of this report under the caption risk factors interest rate increases could increase our cost of current and future debt and in item under the caption liquidity and capital resources
