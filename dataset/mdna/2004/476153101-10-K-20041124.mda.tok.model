overview we are the owner and licensor of sofabed specialty retail stores that specialize in the sale of a complete line of sofa beds and companion pieces such as loveseats  chairs and recliners 
we also have specialty retail stores that specialize in the sale of leather furniture 
in addition  we have stores that sell both fabric and leather furniture 
in july  we entered into proposed settlement agreements and an interim operating agreement with a related private company that currently operates jennifer convertibles stores  which significantly affect the way we operate with the private company 
results of operations fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august net sales included merchandise sales and home delivery income of  and  for the fiscal years ended august  and august   respectively 
net sales of merchandise and home delivery increased  or  for the fiscal year ended august  revenue from service contracts increased to  for the fiscal year ended august   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended august  same store sales increased for the fiscal year ended august   compared to the fiscal year ended august  these increases are primarily due to the overall softness in the economy and the poor weather conditions in the northeast that had affected retailers generally during fiscal cost of sales increased to  for the fiscal year ended august   from  for the fiscal year ended august  cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal  an increase of over the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in store occupancy costs and lower margins associated with merchandise imports 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended august   as compared to  as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended august   a decrease of as a percentage of revenue 
this decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of fees associated with our private label card business along with a reduction in professional fees 
our net receivables of  from the private company increased in the aggregate by  as of august   compared to the prior year end 
we have fully reserved uncollected amounts  which totaled  as of august  and august   respectively 
the collectibility of this amount is uncertain and contingent upon court approval of the proposed settlement agreements and the interim operating agreement 
interest income decreased by  to  for the fiscal year ended august   as compared to  during the prior year 
the decrease is due to less funds available for investments 
we reported income tax expense of  in and income tax benefits of  in the expense results primarily from the increase in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset  net of current tax benefits 
the tax benefit resulted from the tax effect of the loss for the year  net of an increase in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset 
net loss in the fiscal year ended august  was  compared to net loss of  in the fiscal year ended august  this increase is largely attributable to the effect of the increase in the valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset 
fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august net sales includes merchandise sales and home delivery income of  and  for the fiscal years ended august  and august   respectively 
net sales of merchandise and home delivery income decreased  or  for the fiscal year ended august  primarily due to the overall softness in the economy and the poor weather conditions in the northeast that had adversely affected retailers generally 
decreased same store sales were partially offset by revenue from the new stores opened during the year 
revenue from service contracts decreased to  for the fiscal year ended august   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended august  beginning may   we changed the method under which we recognize income from the sale of fabric protection and associated warranties 
before may   the private company was responsible for all fabric protection warranty claims  and all fabric protection revenue was recognized at the time of sale to the customer 
after may   as a result of the execution of the interim operating agreement  we became responsible for all fabric protection claims and revenue from the sale of fabric protection began to be recognized over the estimated service period 
the effect was that fabric protection revenue  which we would have previously recognized as revenue  was immediately treated as deferred income on our balance sheet and  except for the amendment to the agreement with the private company referred to in the following paragraph  would have been recognized in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the plan 
as this accounting treatment was an unintended result of the interim operating agreement  we entered into an amendment to such agreement with the private company pursuant to which  for a payment of  payable in eight installments of  the private company became responsible for fabric protection claims made after june   as to previously sold merchandise and  for  per month  subject to adjustment based on the annual volume of sales of the fabric protection plans  the private company is responsible for fabric protection claims made with respect to all merchandise sold between june  and august   subject to a one year extension at our option 
we delivered to the private company a notice of extension on june  exercising our option through august  as a result of this amendment during fiscal   of revenue  which had been deferred as of august   was recognized in fiscal service contract revenue for was lower than the fiscal year primarily due to the favorable impact of this amendment on results and as a direct result of reduced merchandise sales in fiscal compared to fiscal cost of sales decreased to  for the fiscal year ended august   from  for the fiscal year ended august  however  cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal  an increase of over the prior year 
the increase is attributable to several factors  including the increase of occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue in  the recognition in of the  of fabric protection revenue  as a result of the amendment described above and the decrease in revenue from service contracts which has a very high gross margin compared to furniture sales 
under the interim operating agreement  which went into effect may   we are no longer charged for warehousing fees by the private company  but instead provide such services and charge such fees to the private company 
warehousing fees charged to the private company included in net sales amounted to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal we also bore the expenses of operating the warehouse system 
we reduced such expenses by  to  in fiscal  a reduction compared to  in fiscal such reduction was accomplished primarily by reducing payroll 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended august   as compared to  as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year ended august   an increase of as a percentage of revenue 
although costs decreased by approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased due to the reduction in revenue 
the most significant reason for the decrease in overall expenses can be attributed to a reduction in compensation to officers and sales staff of  and a reduction in advertising expense of  this was partially offset by the  charged to us by the private company pursuant to the interim operating agreement  which includes a requirement that we pay the private company specified amounts based on decreases in its sales volume 
we also experienced an increase in legal fees due to increased litigation 
our net receivables from the private company of  decreased in the aggregate by  as of august   compared to the prior year end 
we have fully reserved uncollected amounts  which totaled  as of august  and  as of august  the collectibility of these amounts is uncertain and contingent upon court approval of the proposed settlement agreements and the interim operating agreement 
interest income decreased by  to  for the fiscal year ended august   as compared to  during the prior year 
the decrease is due to less funds available for investing and lower returns on investments 
we reported income tax benefits of  and  in and  respectively 
the benefit resulted primarily from decreases in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  net of current tax expense 
the tax benefit resulted from the tax effect of the loss for the year  net of an increase in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset 
net loss in the fiscal year ended august  was  compared to net income of  in the fiscal year ended august   resulting in a decrease of income of  in fiscal the principal reasons for the decrease were the overall softness of the economy  current world affairs  the extremely inclement weather in the northeast  the increase in the amount charged to us by the private company pursuant to the interim operating agreement and  of deferred revenue from fiscal which was recognized as revenue in the year ended august  liquidity and capital resources as of august   we had aggregate working capital deficiency of  compared to aggregate working capital of  as of august   and had available cash and cash equivalents of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  as of august  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is a result of our operating loss during fiscal as well as shorter payment terms with principal suppliers  stocking up on inventory from our oversea suppliers in order to meet delivery obligations to our customers and the purchase of an annuity contract 
we have negotiated extended payment terms with principal suppliers effective september and we are contemplating closing certain unproductive stores during fiscal as a result  although general trends in the economy have adversely affected retail sales and our operating cash flow  in the opinion of management  cash flows  together with available working capital will be adequate to fund operations during fiscal we continue to fund the operations of certain of our limited partnership licensees  some of which continue to generate operating losses 
any such losses have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
it is our intention to continue to fund these operations in the future and  if the settlement agreements referred to below are approved  we will acquire of such limited partnerships 
starting in  the private company entered into offset agreements with us that permit us to offset our current monthly obligations to one another up to  amounts in excess of  are paid in cash 
based on the payment terms of these offset agreements  current obligations of the private company and the unconsolidated licensees as of august   have been subsequently paid 
additionally  as part of such agreements  the private company  in november  agreed to assume certain liabilities owed to us by the unconsolidated licensees 
our receivables from the private company and the unconsolidated licensees  which arose in fiscal and prior years  had been reserved for 
in march  we executed a credit and security agreement with our principal supplier  klaussner  which extended the payment terms for merchandise shipped from days to days 
on december   the credit and security agreement was modified to include a late fee of 
per month for invoices we pay beyond the normal day terms 
this provision became effective commencing in january see certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
as part of the credit and security agreement  we granted a security interest in all of our assets including the collateral assignment of our leasehold interests  our trademarks and a license agreement to operate our business in the event of default 
in may  we executed a termination agreement and release whereby klaussner released the liens on our assets 
in fiscal  we opened five new stores and closed two stores 
since the end of fiscal  we have closed four stores and the private company has closed three 
for the fiscal years ended august  and august   we had  and  respectively  in capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures of approximately  during fiscal to support the opening of a new store during the next fiscal year 
we do not anticipate the need for outside financing for such expansion 
in connection with the termination agreement and release executed by klaussner and us in may  a credit line which klaussner had made available to us in december  whereby klaussner agreed to lend us  per new store for up to new stores  was also terminated 
the credit line had never been drawn upon 
the proposed settlement agreements and the interim operating agreement we entered into with the private company impacts our liquidity  capital resources and operations in a number of ways  including in return for providing warehousing services to the stores owned by the private company  the private company will pay us i through may  a fee for all fabric protection and warranty services sold in their stores plus of their yearly net sales for net sales up to an aggregate of  and of their yearly net sales for net sales in excess of  and ii during each month period after may  until we either buy the private company or until december   a fee based on all fabric protection and warranty services sold in their stores plus of their yearly net sales 
we have the right to open an unlimited number of stores in the state of new york for a royalty of  per year which includes stores already opened  provided however  that on november   the management agreement and license pursuant to which we are required to make such royalty payments to the private company was amended such that the private company has agreed to waive its rights to receive from us such annual royalty payment during the period commencing january  through the date on which court approval is granted 
the private company is obligated to pay us  per month for advertising 
this represents a decrease from the  per month to which we were previously entitled 
in addition  if private company sales had been less than  for the initial period from january  through august  or are less than  for each succeeding month period commencing august   we must reimburse the private company for every dollar of sales under those amounts subject to the  and  caps described in the paragraph below 
we were obligated to pay the private company  and  under this provision in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
because we may negatively impact the private company s sales by opening additional stores of our own within the state of new york and because we will be managing the private company s stores  we agreed to pay the private company of the amount by which its net sales for the initial period from january  through august  were less than  provided that if its sales fell below  for that initial period  we were obligated to pay the private company of such shortfall amount  provided further that such amounts  together with amounts we were required to pay for advertising if the private company s sales had dropped below  during such initial period  shall not have  in the aggregate  exceeded  for such initial period 
upon the expiration of the initial period  if the private company s sales during any month period commencing on august  are less than  we are obligated to pay the private company of such shortfall amount  provided that if its yearly net sales fall below  we will pay the private company of such shortfall amount  provided further that such amounts  together with amounts we may pay for advertising if the private company s sales drop below  during in any month period  shall not  in the aggregate  exceed  during such month period 
we were obligated to pay the private company  and  under this provision in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
on november   the management agreement and license pursuant to which we are required to make such payments to the private company was amended such that the private company has agreed to waive its rights to receive the payments described above during the period commencing january  through august  this waiver also covers any payments during such period in the event that the settlement agreements are approved by the court and become effective during such period 
harley j 
greenfield  our chairman and chief executive officer and a principal stockholder  and edward seidner  our executive vice president  former director and a principal stockholder had agreed to be responsible for up to an aggregate of  of amounts due under these provisions in each year 
this agreement with messrs 
greenfield and seidner was terminated effective july  and they were not required to pay  for the year ended august  the company recorded  of compensation expense and a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital representing the benefit received by messrs 
greenfield and seidner as a result of the termination of the agreement 
in settlement of certain disputes as to amounts due us from the private company  all of which have been fully reserved  the private company will execute three promissory notes to us in the aggregate principal amount of  including a note in the principal amount of  due over three years and bearing interest at per annum  a note in the principal amount of  due over five years and bearing interest at per annum  and a note in the principal amount of  due over five years without interest  plus amounts owed as of the date in which settlement is approved by the court  for purchasing and other services 
the effect of these agreements with the private company  including our assumption of the warehousing responsibilities  adversely effected our operating results by  and  in fiscal and  respectively  and improved our operating results by  for fiscal  compared to the results we would have achieved based on the same sales levels under the agreements effective prior to the initial operating agreement 
there is no assurance that the agreement will improve our future operating results in the future 
for a more detailed discussion of the proposed settlement agreement and the interim operating agreement  see certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations in total  for each of the next five years and thereafter  as of august  such obligations include the retail store and shuttle warehouse leases  the lease for the executive office  written employment contracts for two of our executive officers  and agreements to pay the private company royalties 
caption dollars in thousands thereafter total operating leases for retail stores  shuttle warehouses and executive office        royalty payments to the private company employment contracts fabric protection fees to the private company total contractual obligations        while we pay the private company  pursuant to the interim operating agreement  for the cost of the warehouse leases  such leases are not contractual obligations for which we are directly liable 
the approximate amount that we pay the private company for the leases is  per year see note below and is not included in the table above 
the amount of the royalty payments  as well as our obligation to make such payments to the private company  may be contingent upon the approval of the proposed settlement agreement by the court 
based on the approval of the proposed settlement agreements 
the table does not include a commitment to pay the private company a maximum of million annually see discussion above in shortfall payments and certain other amounts that are not currently determinable  such as warehousing fees 
we are party to four warehouse leases of which the private company pays two 
these amounts include the approximate payments for all four warehouse leases 
significant accounting policies the receivable from the private company as of august  represents current charges aggregating  principally for merchandise transfers  warehousing services and advertising costs  which are payable within days of the end of the month in which the transactions originate 
such amount has been fully paid subsequent to the balance sheet date 
in addition to the above  the receivables from the private company include  representing unpaid amounts from fiscal and prior years  which are in dispute and have been fully reserved for in the accompanying financial statements 
as explained in note in notes to consolidated financial statements  as part of a proposed settlement  the disputed balance will be settled by the private company executing two notes to us in the aggregate principal amount of  payable over a three to five year period 
we intend to maintain a reserve for the full amount of the notes and record income as collections are received 
the arrangement with respect to the transfer of merchandise between the private company  which operates retail stores operating under the jennifer convertibles name  and us arises from the private company s desire to avail itself of our economic leverage in purchasing merchandise for its jennifer convertibles stores 
the purchasing agreement provides that the we will purchase merchandise on behalf of ourselves and the private company and bill the private company at cost as invoiced by the vendor and pass through to the private company the benefit of volume related discounts received from the vendor 
we do not believe it likely that the private company  if purchasing directly from vendors  would get the same favorable volume related pricing that we receive 
in effect  we are accommodating the private company  which is a related party 
the merchandise transfers are not reflected in our consolidated statements of operations and do not impact our earnings 
sales and delivery fees paid by customers are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
sales are made on either a non financed or financed basis 
a minimum deposit of is typically required upon placing a non financed sales order with the balance payable upon delivery 
commencing june   and prior to may   a subsidiary of the private company assumed all performance obligations and risks of any loss under the lifetime protection plans and accordingly  we recognized revenue from the sale of service contracts related to the plans during such periods at the time of sale to the customer 
during the period from may  through june  as part of the interim operating agreement entered into with the private company  we agreed to assume responsibility and risk of loss under the plans for sales of service contracts during such period and accordingly revenue from sales of the service contracts was deferred and amortized into income in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred in performing services under the plans 
inflation there was no significant impact on our operations as a result of inflation during the three fiscal years ended august   august  and august  risk factors cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements 
this annual report contains certain forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as being applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report on form k 
there is no assurance we will operate profitably 
we incurred a net loss of  and  in the fiscal years ended august  and august   respectively and achieved net income of  in the fiscal year ended august  the furniture business is cyclical and we have been impacted and will continue to be affected by changes in such cycles  by losses from new stores  the overall economic and political climate  changes in consumer preferences or demographics or unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause us to continue to incur losses from operations 
the outcome of pending litigation is uncertain and may entail significant expense 
as described under legal proceedings  we are currently involved in certain derivative litigation 
we have spent a substantial amount on legal fees and other expenses in connection with such litigation 
although we have entered into proposed settlement agreements which we expect will soon be presented to the court for its approval  effectiveness of such agreements is subject to such court approval and other conditions and there can be no assurance that such conditions will be met 
in addition to the derivative litigation  as described under legal proceedings  there are several other actions in which we are involved 
there is no assurance that we will prevail in these actions and to the extent that any recovery is not covered by insurance  it could adversely affect our cash position 
we may be liable for up to  per year of short fall payments to the private company 
as part of our proposed settlement with the private company  we obtained the right to open an unlimited number of stores in new york for a royalty of  per year 
because we will be managing the private company s stores and because we may negatively impact the private company s sales by opening stores in its territory  we agreed to pay the private company up to  for the initial period beginning january  and ended august  and  per year thereafter  if its sales drop below specified levels 
for the initial period  which ended august   the amount of short fall payments we paid to the private company was  and for fiscal year ended august  the amount was  the provisions of the proposed settlement are currently in effect as a result of the interim operating agreement 
however  on november   the management agreement and license pursuant to which we are required to make such payments to the private company was amended such that the private company has agreed to waive its rights to receive the payments described above during the period commencing january  through august  this waiver also covers any payments during such period in the event that the settlement agreements are approved by the court and become effective during such period 
in addition  pursuant to the amendment  the private company has agreed to waive its rights to receive from us an annual royalty payment in the amount of  per year during the period commencing january  through the date on which court approval is granted 
our company could suffer from potential conflict of interest 
potential conflicts of interest exist since harley j 
greenfield  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  and edward b 
seidner  our executive vice president  and a former director  are owed over million by the private company  which owns  controls or licenses the private company stores 
accordingly  such persons derive substantial economic benefits from the private company 
in addition  fred love  the co founder of the related private company  was mr 
greenfield s brother in law 
mr 
love passed away in october and jane love  mr 
greenfield s sister  is currently acting as the interim president of the private company 
circumstances may arise in which the interest of the private company stores  of the private company or of mr 
greenfield and mr 
seidner will conflict with our interests  including the negotiations to settle the litigation described above 
there are also numerous relationships  and have been numerous transactions  between us and the private company  including an agreement under which we warehouse and purchase merchandise for the private company  manage its stores and provide it other services 
see certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
we heavily depend on three suppliers 
we purchase a significant percentage of our merchandise from klaussner  which also manufactures furniture under the sealy brand name 
during the fiscal year ended august   we purchased approximately of our merchandise from klaussner 
since a large portion of our revenues have been derived from sales of klaussner products  the loss of this supplier could have a material adverse impact on us until alternative sources of supply are established 
klaussner is also a principal stockholder and creditor of ours and owns retail stores that compete with ours 
klaussner s position as a significant creditor could potentially result in a temporary or permanent loss of our principal supply of merchandise  if  for example  klaussner halted supply because we defaulted on or were late in making our payments to klaussner 
see certain relationships and related transactions in our proxy statement to be furnished in connection with our annual meeting of stockholders to be held february   which is hereby incorporated by reference 
also  we purchase a significant percentage of our merchandise from two other non affiliated suppliers 
during the fiscal year ended august   we purchased approximately of our merchandise from the two non affiliated suppliers 
the cyclical nature of the furniture industry poses risks to us from prolonged economic downturn 
the furniture industry has been historically cyclical  fluctuating with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  the furniture industry tends to experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy 
we believe that the industry is significantly influenced by economic and political conditions generally and particularly by consumer behavior and confidence  the level of personal discretionary spending  housing activity  interest rates  credit availability  demographics and overall consumer confidence 
all of these factors are currently being negatively affected by the economic downturn and a prolonged economic downturn might have a material adverse effect on our business 
competition in the furniture industry could cost us sales and cause us to reduce prices 
the retail sofabed business is highly competitive and includes competition from traditional furniture retailers and department stores as well as numerous discount furniture outlets 
our stores may face sharp price cutting  as well as imitation and other forms of competition  and we cannot prevent or restrain others from utilizing a similar marketing format 
although we are the largest sofabed specialty retail dealer in the united states  many of our competitors have considerably greater financial resources 
we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing 
our ability to expand and support our business may depend upon our ability to obtain additional financing 
we may have difficulty obtaining debt or equity financing 
until may  when we executed the termination and release agreement  all of our assets were pledged to klaussner as security for the amounts we owe under the klaussner credit and security agreement 
from time to time  our financial position has made it difficult for us to secure third party consumer financing 
inability to offer such financing adversely affects sales 
harley j 
greenfield and current management are likely to retain control 
as of november   harley j 
greenfield  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer and principal stockholder  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
approximately of the outstanding common stock is beneficially owned by all officers and directors as a group  including messrs 
greenfield and seidner 
since the holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights  such officers and directors ownership of our common stock will likely enable them to exercise significant influence in matters such as the election of our directors and other matters submitted for stockholder approval 
also  the relationship of such persons to the private company could serve to perpetuate management s control in light of the private company s performance of important functions 
our future success depends heavily on two executives 
our future success will depend substantially upon the abilities of harley j 
greenfield  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer and one of our principal stockholders  as well as rami abada  our president  chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
the loss of mr 
greenfield s and or mr 
abada s services could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects for the future 
we do not have key man insurance on the lives of such individuals 
we are not likely to declare dividends on common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently anticipate that we will retain all our earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and  therefore  do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future
