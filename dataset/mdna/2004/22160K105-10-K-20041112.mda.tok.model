the  of 
senior notes issued in march reduced the amount of registered securities available for future issuance to derivatives the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms 
the aggregate amount of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at august  was not material 
the only significant derivative instruments the company holds are interest rate swaps  which the company uses to manage the interest rate risk associated with its borrowings and to manage the company s mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
as of august   the company had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of  and an aggregate fair value of  which is recorded in other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these swaps were entered into effective november   and march   and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of the company s  
senior notes and the company s  
senior notes  respectively 
as the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt  the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact

the repurchased shares would constitute authorized  but non issued shares and would be used for general corporate purposes  including stock option grants under stock option programs 
on october   the board of directors renewed the program for another three years 
to date  no shares have been repurchased under either program 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations 
management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise inventory  impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs and insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the present circumstances 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales  net of estimated returns  at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services 
when the company collects payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed 
the company provides for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting  and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company believes the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
the company records an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
the company considers in its calculation of the lifo cost the estimated net realizable value of inventory in those inventory pools where deflation exists and records a write down of inventory where estimated net realizable value is less than lifo inventory 
the company provides for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts on the basis of a percentage of sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the trend of the actual physical inventory count results  which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as the company progresses towards earning those rebates provided they are probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approach 
impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments are based on market and operational conditions at the present time 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
the company provides estimates for warehouse closing costs when it is appropriate to do so based on the applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
future circumstances may result in the company s actual future closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued insurance self insurance liabilities the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property insurance  director and officers liability  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and outside expertise  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  eitf 
the guidance prescribes a three step model for determining whether an investment is other than temporarily impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on investments

the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  fsp eitf 
fsp eitf delays the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance contained in paragraphs of eitf issue during the period of the delay  fsp eitf states that companies should continue to apply relevant other than temporary guidance 
the adoption of eitf  excluding paragraphs  did not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company will assess the impact of paragraphs of eitf once the guidance has been finalized 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin r requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which was issued in january and revised the implementation date to the first fiscal period ending after march   with the exception of special purpose entities 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached consensus on issue no 
 application of issue no 
by resellers to sales incentives offered to consumers by manufacturers  with respect to determining if consideration received by a reseller from a vendor that is reimbursed by the vendor for honoring the vendor s sale incentives offered directly to consumers should be recorded as a reduction in sales 
these rules apply to transactions entered into by consumers in fiscal periods beginning after november  and  therefore  apply to such transactions starting with the company s fiscal third quarter of  which began february  the adoption of eitf did not affect the company s consolidated gross profit or net income  but did result in a reduction of both net sales and merchandise costs by an equal amount 
for fiscal  net sales and merchandise costs have been reduced by  had the company s comparable periods in fiscal and been reported under eitf guidance  the sales and cost of sales would have been reduced by  and  respectively 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in november  the eitf reached consensus on certain issues discussed in issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  with respect to determining how a reseller should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement 
requirements for recognizing volume based rebates are effective for arrangements entered into or modified after november  and resellers with other supplier payments should generally apply the new rules prospectively for agreements entered into or modified after december  the adoption of this consensus by the company in fiscal did not have a significant impact on the company on an annual basis  but resulted in a change in the timing for the recognition of some vendor allowances for certain agreements entered into subsequent to december  and extends the recognition time frame beyond that which was in effect for similar contracts entered into prior to december  net income for fiscal was negatively impacted by approximately  after tax due to the adoption of eitf item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates 
as a policy  the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the nature and amount of the company s long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of august   the company s fixed rate long term debt includes its  principal amount at maturity zero coupon subordinated notes and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling  the company s debt also includes  
senior notes and  
senior notes 
the company has entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the senior notes  effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities 
fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt 
the company holds interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
as the majority of these instruments are of a short term nature  if interest rates were to increase or decrease immediately  there is no material risk of a valuation adjustment related to these instruments 
for those instruments that are classified as available for sale  the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in interest rates are reflected in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss 
based on the company s cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at august   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately  to interest income pre tax on an annual basis 
most foreign currency transactions have been conducted in local currencies  limiting the company s exposure to changes in currency rates 
the company periodically enters into short term forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on inventory purchases 
the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at august  was not material to the company s results of operations or its financial position
