item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with an overview of our overall strategy and the strategy for our two business units to give the reader a view of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving 
this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results 
following that  beginning on page  we discuss our results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and discuss our financial commitments in the sections entitled liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet financing arrangements 
forward looking statements this portion of our annual report contains forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results may differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors  including those factors described in risk factors and important factors that may affect future results beginning on page readers should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements  and we assume no obligation and do not intend to update any forward looking statements 
our strategy our goal is to be the world s leading provider of software and hardware solutions for the optimization and automation of plastics focused manufacturing by offering customers a broad range of solutions to improve the way they design and produce parts and molds through powerful and robust technology based products and services 
our focus is to help customers manufacture cheaper and more reliable plastic products by increasing the effectiveness of their designs and their manufacturing operations and improving efficiencies across the entire design through manufacture process 
we believe that our key competitive strength is our extensive domain knowledge in the fields of materials science and characterization  numerical methods and predictive modeling through simulation and analysis  coupled with our expertise in packaging and delivering this knowledge to our customers in easy to use software and hardware applications 
we develop software products internally and through cooperative research relationships with a number of public and private educational and research organizations around the world 
in addition  some of our products are developed by commercial contractors 
because of the strong body of intellectual property and knowledge that we have created over the course of twenty six years in serving the plastics design and manufacturing market  we have become the leading provider of highly sophisticated predictive software applications for the plastics design engineering and manufacturing communities 
plastics are pervasive throughout a broad range of vertical industry applications including the automotive  electronics  packaging  medical products and consumer goods industries 
these industries are generally large and growing 
because the supply chains that support the design and production of plastic parts in these industries are often fragmented and comprised of multiple companies in various geographies around the globe  we have developed a wide range of applications that can be used by participants at all stages of the plastics value chain to optimize their process and reduce their costs 
our strategy is to deliver our deep domain 
table of contents expertise in plastics packaged in software and system solutions that address the specific issues of the participants in each of these stages and increase our penetration of these industries by making our products available through a combination of direct and independent sales representatives  resellers and engineering consultants around the globe 
for the design of plastic parts and molds  our strategy is to provide products which enable analysis driven design  in the earliest stages of product development  by making analysis technology more integral to the design process 
in doing so  we seek to make our technology available to a wider audience of potential users in mainstream design markets  including those engineers who are not specialists in plastics design 
by building upon our existing technology categories  we bring powerful solutions which are easy to learn and use  providing low cost of deployment and rapid return on investment 
for manufacturers of plastic parts  our strategy is to offer a range of products which address the needs for optimizing and automating the set up  temperature  flow  control and monitoring of the primary equipment and other process elements in the manufacturing process 
our solutions include applications which provide real time business performance management information that enables companies to manage their manufacturing operations throughout the production process 
because of our extensive knowledge of the material properties of plastics and the physics involved in the process of converting raw plastic to finished goods  we can assist companies to obtain higher production yields  reduced cycle times  improved process reliability and better part quality 
our growth strategy derives from these strengths 
we continue to increase the business value of our design solutions and manufacturing solutions for our customers in a number of ways 
we improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release 
we develop products addressing specific vertical market needs in each of the target market segments of our business 
in the design phase  for example  we provide applications which address the process of microchip encapsulation  a process which is involved in the manufacture of semiconductors 
in the manufacturing phase  we offer solutions to the die cast market  a conversion process that is similar to the plastics manufacturing process 
expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy 
we believe that the rapidly growing economies in china and other developing countries present significant longer term growth opportunities for our business 
our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development and lower costs 
international development  however  also involves significant costs and challenges  including whether we can adequately protect our intellectual property and derive significant revenue in areas where laws regarding intellectual property are not in place or not effectively enforced 
a significant part of our growth strategy is based upon building on the customer loyalty that we have achieved and the large installed base that we have built 
we receive approximately to of our overall revenues from repeat customers 
we deliver product releases on a regular and timely basis which incorporate significant functionality improvements to ensure that our customers have access to the latest technology developments 
we focus on customer satisfaction through programs aimed at involving our customers in the future direction of our products  enhancing their ease of use and user experience  and providing multiple points of contact within the company to ensure that their needs are met 
we believe that increases in our efficiency and productivity will allow us to increase investment in our growth initiatives while improving our profitability 
we are managing our business with a goal to achieve annual operating margins in the to target range by the second half of fiscal year this goal is based upon current generally accepted accounting principles and makes no attempt to consider the effect of future changes to those principles  including the potential expensing of stock options  which would have a material adverse effect on our operating margins 
in the longer term  we will continue to balance operating margin targets with revenue growth opportunities 
our uses of cash include capital expenditures to support our operations and our product development  mergers and acquisitions  and investments in growth initiatives 
we continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities to the extent they support our strategy and our growth objectives

our primary offerings are our moldflow plastics xpert for process set up  optimization and control  our shotscope process monitoring and control application  our altanium system for temperature and process control and our celltrack product  formerly known as mms production monitoring  for monitoring and reporting on the operations across the factory floor 
our manufacturing solutions products are an integration of our internally developed moldflow plastics xpert product  with shotscope  celltrack and altanium  all of which were initially developed by companies we have acquired 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our reported revenues and results of operations as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty  and are made based on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document  we believe that our most important critical accounting policies are with respect to the following revenue recognition  asset valuation allowances  acquisition accounting  impairment of acquired intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets  income tax accounting  restructuring charges  hedge accounting  capitalization of software development costs  and stock option accounting 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations 
they may require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from three principal sources license fees for packaged software products  product fees for manufacturing management systems and hot runner process controllers  and service fees from maintenance and support contracts  consulting  implementation  training and material testing services 
packaged software products and manufacturing management systems for revenue derived from license fees for packaged software products and from product fees for manufacturing management systems  we follow aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions  both of which provide guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in recognizing revenue on software transactions 
we recognize revenue from sales of software licenses upon product shipment provided that evidence of the arrangement exists  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and free of contingencies 
maintenance and support contracts are often entered into at the same time as the sale of software licenses 
in accordance with sop  we consider these multiple elements of a single arrangement 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues from arrangements like these with one or more elements to be delivered at a future date  when evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements  such as installation and maintenance services  is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we determine vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of undelivered services based on the prices that are charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
the fair value of maintenance and support services may also be determined based on the price to be paid upon renewal of that service in accordance with the optional renewal terms offered contractually to a customer 
if sufficient evidence of the fair value of an undelivered element does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized upon delivery of that element or at the time that fair value can be established for the undelivered element 
we recognize revenue from software maintenance and support contracts ratably over the related contract period and from training and other services as they are performed 
our software products do not require significant modification or customization 
implementation of the products is generally routine and can be performed by the customer or other third party providers 
hot runner process controllers for revenue derived from sales of hot runner process controllers and other hardware products with insignificant embedded software  we apply the guidance of eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the product is shipped to the customer  provided that evidence of the arrangement exists  legal title has passed to the customer  all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied  the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
our hot runner process controllers do not require significant modification or customization and installation of the products is generally routine and may be performed by the customer or other third parties 
general at the time of product shipment  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenue is only recognized if we are reasonably assured that collection will occur 
in making this 
table of contents assessment  we consider customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience 
if we determine that collectibility of a particular sale is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which generally occurs upon receipt of payment from the customer 
also at the time of product shipment  we assess whether the total fee payable to us for the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies 
in assessing whether the consideration payable to us is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  including whether the terms are extended  and our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  among other factors 
if the total consideration payable to us is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if an arrangement includes customer acceptance criteria  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until acceptance is received or the acceptance period has lapsed  unless those acceptance criteria only require that the product perform in accordance with our standard published product specifications 
if a customer s obligation to pay us is contingent upon a future event such as installation or acceptance  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until that event has occurred 
a portion of our revenue is derived from sales to resellers 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of the product to these resellers  provided that the same conditions for revenue recognition described above are met 
our arrangements with customers  including resellers  do not contain any rights of product return  other than those related to standard warranty provisions that permit repair or replacement of defective goods 
anticipated warranty costs are accrued upon product shipment 
asset valuation allowances management must estimate the amount of our accounts receivable which may be uncollectible due to the inability of our customers to make payments 
we review the composition of accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily on a specific identification basis 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers deteriorates after entering into a revenue arrangement resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of june   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts of  management writes down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those assumed by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
as of june   our inventory balance was million 
acquisition accounting we allocate the purchase price of each acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value on the date of acquisition 
in certain cases  we engage third party appraisers to determine the fair value of the assets acquired 
for example  we obtained a third party fair value appraisal for the intangible assets that were acquired in our january purchase of american msi corporation 
in other cases  depending upon the size of the acquisition and the nature of assets and liabilities acquired  management estimates the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities based upon a number of generally accepted valuation methodologies 
for example  for our january acquisition of c ntrole de processus industriels sarl cpi  the fair value of the acquired developed technologies was based upon a discounted cash flow model  the fair value of the acquired customer base was based upon estimated replacement costs  and the fair value assigned to non compete agreements was based upon the salaries of the individuals subject to such agreements and the length of the agreement 
in all cases  any excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 

table of contents all such valuation methodologies  as well as the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
impairment of acquired intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets management assesses the impairment of identifiable acquired intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets at least on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of a product line or operating activity relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of acquired intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment  we assess whether an impairment has occurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminated amortization of goodwill and introduced a two step impairment test model to be applied upon adoption and at least annually thereafter 
transitional and annual impairment tests of goodwill are to be conducted on the basis of a company s reporting units  as defined in sfas no 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  the company must then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to determine if an impairment has occurred 
any resulting impairment would be expensed immediately 
in adopting sfas no 
 we conducted the required transitional impairment test as of july   concluding that no impairment of the goodwill acquired in the acquisitions prior to that date had occurred 
from the date of adoption through the date of our third quarter fiscal impairment test  we operated as a single reporting unit 
to estimate the fair value of that reporting unit  we employed a market value approach  under which the average closing price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq national market  was determined for a set number of days in the third fiscal quarter 
this average closing price was deemed to be the fair value of our stock and was then multiplied by the number of shares of common stock outstanding to determine the company s total fair value 
that total fair value was then compared to the recorded carrying value of our total net assets as of the end of our third fiscal quarter to identify potential impairments 
we did not identify any potential impairments as a result of these tests 
as a result of our reorganization into two separate business units in late  we will conduct our future goodwill impairment assessments in the context of two reporting units 
as of june   our remaining goodwill and acquired intangible assets were million  net of accumulated amortization of million 
restructuring charges we periodically record charges resulting from restructuring of our operations  including the consolidation of operations  changes in our strategic plan  or managerial responses to declines in demand  increasing costs or other events 
the determination of restructuring charges requires management s judgment and may include such costs and charges as those related to employee severance  termination benefits  the write off of assets  professional service fees and costs for future lease commitments on excess facilities  net of any estimated income from subleases 
in determining the amount of charges related to excess facilities  we are required to estimate such factors as vacancy rates  the time required to sublet properties and sublease rates 
all such 
table of contents estimates are reviewed and  if necessary  revised on a quarterly basis  which may result in adjustments to previously recorded liability accruals 
in april  we enacted a restructuring plan to resize our business and reduce overhead costs 
in march  we enacted a restructuring plan related to our acquisition of cpi 
in january  we enacted a restructuring plan related to our acquisition of amsi and the reorganization of our operations into two business units 
each of these restructuring plans involved the recording of certain restructuring charges 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax liability and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense within the income tax provision of our consolidated statement of operations 
based upon our historical results of operations  we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of june   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses 
at june   our net deferred tax asset balance was  net of a tax asset valuation allowance of million and deferred tax liabilities of  management believes that the net deferred tax asset balance represents the best estimate  based upon the weight of available evidence  of the deferred tax assets that will be realized in future periods 
if such evidence were to change  based upon near term operating results and longer term projections  the amount of the valuation allowance recorded against the gross deferred tax assets may be decreased or increased 
hedge accounting we hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated inter company sales and a portion of our foreign currency denominated inter company research and development payments with derivative financial instruments  including currency options  zero cost collars and other instruments 
as the hedging activities are based upon our forecasts  a significant amount of judgment and estimation is required in assessing the appropriateness of hedge accounting for the instruments 
if these judgments or estimates are incorrect or if the hedging transactions are not highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of the hedged items  amounts currently recorded as unrealized gains and losses may be realized in our earnings 
at june   hedging instruments with fair values of  were recorded as components of other current assets 
net unrealized gains on these instruments of  were included as a component of equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
capitalization of software development costs we follow sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which requires that costs associated with the development of computer software and related products be expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility  and capitalized thereafter until commercial release of the software products 
both the assessment of the amount of costs required to be capitalized and the determination of subsequent amortization periods involve significant judgments and estimates 
as of june   our capitalized software development costs were million  net of accumulated amortization of  these costs are being amortized over the estimated economic lives of the related software products  which range from three to five years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents stock option accounting we do not record compensation expense when stock option grants are awarded to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
had we recorded compensation expense based on the fair value of each stock option  our net income would have been substantially less 
in addition  if we are required to record such compensation expense  our ability to achieve our target operating margins will be adversely affected 
the impact of expensing employee stock awards is further described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
reporting periods our fiscal year end is june references to  or mean the fiscal year ended june  unless otherwise indicated 
overview of fiscal results of operations highlights included growth in revenues to million in from million in  an increase in earnings to income of per diluted share in from a loss of per share in  cash generated from operations of million  an increase of million from  the acquisition of american msi corporation in january for consideration of million  and the establishment of business units focused along product and market lines 
summary of fiscal operating performance fiscal year as a fiscal year as a ended of ended of june  revenue june  revenue in thousands revenue cost of revenue operating expenses  excluding amortization of acquired intangibles and restructuring charges restructuring charges amortization of acquired intangible assets income loss from operations for fiscal  our primary goals were to drive revenue growth from our products and services  while increasing our operating efficiency to move our business model toward our long term operating margin objectives 
we made considerable progress towards our goals  as our income from operations increased from approximately break even in to six percent of revenue in our total revenue was higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to strong growth in our design analysis solutions product sales coupled with the positive effects of changes in foreign currencies  principally driven by the strength of the euro and japanese yen  as well as from revenue generated by the acquired operations of american msi corporation in january we generate revenues in the united states  europe and the asia australia region  in particular in japan  korea  taiwan and china 
the weaker value of the us dollar  relative to other currencies  had a positive impact of  on operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal had exchange rates from fiscal 
table of contents been in effect during fiscal  translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been million lower and operating expenses would have been million lower 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of american msi corporation amsi  a company located in moorpark  california  for million in cash  of which million was used to retire all of amsi s outstanding debt  and the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at million 
in addition  we paid  of costs directly related to the acquisition 
the results of amsi have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
amsi is a leading solution provider of hot runner process controllers for the injection molding industry 
hot runners are a key element of sophisticated mold systems used in the manufacture of large components or molds with high cavitation  typically used in industries such as automotive  packaging and medical instruments 
hot runner process controllers facilitate precise control of the temperature of the molten plastic  providing optimized feedback and extensive mold diagnostics and process data collection 
amsi was acquired to expand the breadth of our product offerings in our manufacturing solutions group and to bring additional managerial depth to the organization 
the acquisition of american msi gave us critical mass in our manufacturing solutions business and allowed us to reorganize our operations into two business units  design analysis solutions and manufacturing solutions  strategically focused along the lines of our product groups and end user markets 
this change enhanced our management focus on expanding the growth opportunities of each of our main product lines by creating an organizational structure in which the growth objectives and incentives would be more closely aligned 
we believe that these organizational changes  coupled with the enhancement and expansion of our product lines  leave us better positioned to serve the needs of our existing and new end user industries 
as we executed on this reorganization  we incurred restructuring charges for severance and other termination costs totaling  in the third quarter of fiscal the reorganization into two business units was substantially completed by june  and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action in the future 
our operating expenses  excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets and restructuring charges  increased million in fiscal but declined as a percentage of revenue as compared to fiscal the increase is due primarily to higher variable costs based on current sales performance as well as costs of personnel added in our acquisition of amsi 
our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue  given the nature of most of our operating expenses  which consist primarily of employee related expenditures  facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense 
in future periods  employee related expenditures would likely increase substantially if we are required to record compensation expense related to employee stock option grants 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash from our operating activities as compared to million in the previous year 
we finished the year with million in cash and marketable securities and no long term debt 
results of operations in  our operations were negatively impacted by severe economic downturns in many of our major geographic and end user markets 
accordingly  we took actions in to resize our business and reduce our overhead costs 
in and  we have focused our management efforts on achieving growth in revenue and improving the profitability of our business operations

table of contents our product revenue includes both license fees for our packaged software application products and product fees for our manufacturing management systems and hot runner process controllers 
typically  our customers pay an up front  one time fee for our products 
for our packaged software applications  the amount of the fee depends upon the number and type of software modules licensed and the number of the customer s employees or other users who can access the software product simultaneously 
our mpa product is subject to the terms of a click wrapped software license agreement that is included as part of each customer s installation process 
for sales of our other packaged software products  we generally require a signed license agreement 
for our manufacturing management and hot runner process controllers  the amount of the fee depends upon the number and type of software modules licensed with the system  if any  and the system s hardware components 
we generally require a signed license agreement for sales of our manufacturing management systems that have significant application software functionality 
in addition  we receive royalty payments from developers of other software products related to the bundling of our software with their design software programs 
we record these payments as revenue as well  but such amounts have been immaterial to date 
in fiscal  our product revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase was due  in part  to sales of products acquired in our acquisition of american msi corporation  which contributed million of product revenue during the fiscal year 
in addition  our product revenue grew as the result of the introduction of new products and our extended distribution capabilities  which allowed us to reach a broader segment of the mid range design market 
we added approximately new customers in fiscal  compared to approximately and new customers in and  respectively 
sales to new customers represented of total product revenue in fiscal  compared to and of total product revenue in and  respectively 
we believe that the lower percentage of revenue from new customers in and is a result of the introduction of new product modules in our das business that are typically sold to existing customers and our strategy of pursuing larger follow on transactions for our ms business 
pricing of individual products within our product families can vary greatly  and the mix of products sold during a given period can significantly impact our average selling price per seat 
as such  we do not believe that an average selling price per seat provides a meaningful measure of our business 
design analysis solutions product revenue product revenue from our design analysis solutions das increased by million  or  to million in when compared to  due mostly to strong sales results in the asia australia region  in particular in japan  korea and taiwan  and in the europe region  in particular in france and germany 
we believe that this strong sales growth is the result of a number of factors  including economic recovery in certain of our key markets  new product introductions that expanded our base of potential customers and the expansion of our indirect distribution channel 
in december  we released mpa version  which introduced new complementary add on modules to our previous mpa product 
we believe that this product release has increased the appeal of the product to a broader base of engineers  resulting in increased sales of this product family in the second half of fiscal year we experienced a decline of million  or  in our design analysis solutions product revenue from to demand for our das products is largely driven by the number of new designs and molds created to meet the demand for the end products of our customers 
the industries in which many of our key customers operate  including the consumer products  telecommunications and electronics industries  were among those most severely impacted by prolonged economic pressures which began during as such  in many cases  these companies reduced their spending on capital items  including spending on our products 
we believe that the decline in das product revenues during fiscal was due to lower demand for these products as a result of the challenging economic conditions that were affecting our major end user and geographic markets  including the us and europe  which resulted in decreases in the related product revenue 
table of contents in these regions of and  respectively 
the decline was partially offset by a increase in revenue from our asia australia region  which included a increase in product revenue in japan 
das product revenue in japan was million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
we believe that the increase in product revenue in japan in both and was a result of a broadening of the market for our products beyond our traditional customer base to include participants in the automotive and electronics supply chains and a result of a mild economic recovery in japan which resulted in higher levels of capital spending by our customers 
to a lesser extent  favorable exchange rates also contributed to the growth of japanese revenue 
we sold seats of das products in fiscal  compared to and seats of these products in and  respectively 
manufacturing solutions product revenue product revenue from our manufacturing solutions ms products increased by million  or  to million in compared to  due primarily to sales of hot runner process controllers  a product line that was acquired in our january acquisition of amsi 
sales of hot runner process controllers accounted for million of our ms product revenue in excluding the sales of these products  revenues from our traditional manufacturing process monitoring and control products decreased by  in when compared to that decline resulted from lower sales volumes in the united states  which we believe was due to a combination of factors 
these factors included continued challenging economic conditions experienced by united states based manufacturing companies  including the plastics industry  during fiscal and  to a lesser degree  the impact of the reorganization of our operations into business units and changes to sales territory assignments during the second half of the year 
sales of our ms products increased by million  or  to million in compared to the increase in this revenue was primarily attributable to growth in our european market  and to a lesser degree  favorable foreign exchange rates 
the growth in the underlying business was primarily the result of orders received for large plant wide implementations in the electronics and automotive sectors and the impact of revenue in europe from sales of our production monitoring products  which contributed revenue of  following our january acquisition of cpi 
we sold seats of our ms products in fiscal  including units of our hot runner process controllers  compared to and seats of ms products in and  respectively 
services revenue we derive revenue from maintenance and support contracts that require us to provide technical support services to customers and unspecified product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
we also provide consulting and implementation services  training of customers employees and material testing services 
in fiscal  services revenue from the das business unit was million and services revenue from the ms business unit was million 
prior to fiscal  services revenue was not separately tracked by product line

additionally  from time to time  we engage outside consultants to meet peaks in customer demand for consulting and implementation services 
our cost of services revenue was million in  million in and million in the significant increase in these expenses from to was due primarily to the impact of an organizational change and redirection of our technical sales staff from research and development and sales functions to our post sales and implementation groups  the costs of which are included in cost of services revenue

 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  requires the capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility up to the point of the product s release 
prior to fiscal  costs eligible for capitalization were not significant 
since that time  the complexity of many of our newly developed software products has increased  and  as a result  the period of time and costs incurred between the establishment of technological feasibility of the product and the point of the product s release have increased 
accordingly  the amount of capitalized research and development costs has also increased 
in accordance with sfas no 
 research and development costs of   and  were capitalized in  and  respectively 
all such capitalized costs are being amortized to cost of product revenue over the estimated economic life of the related products  which ranges from three to five years 
we expect to incur additional capitalizable software development costs of similar amounts in fiscal with the planned releases of several product enhancements 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in  excluding amounts incurred and capitalized for software development 
the increase in was primarily attributable to increased compensation expense  which resulted from the combination of several factors  including the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our annual salary increases that took effect in october  and development staff added in our january acquisition of amsi  offset in part by an increase of  in the amount of capitalized software development costs and the redirection of some members of our technical staff to post sales and implementation groups 
the decrease from to was attributable to a  increase in the amount of capitalized software costs and the elimination of technical positions as a result of our april restructuring  which reduced our compensation and headcount related expenses

these increases were offset  in part  by the impact of our redirection in of sales resources to customer support and implementation activities  the cost of which is included in cost of services revenue 
this organizational change reduced our selling and marketing expenses by million as compared to and increased cost of services revenue by a corresponding amount 
the increase in expense in as compared to was primarily attributable to increased commission expense resulting from our increased total revenue  and to a lesser degree  foreign exchange rates

in light of the more highly regulated financial reporting environment  we expect these costs to increase in fiscal as we continue to comply with these requirements

in and  we incurred income taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions that could not be offset in the financial statement tax provision by tax benefits arising from losses in other jurisdictions 
we expect that a similar result could occur in future periods due to the globally distributed nature of our operations and certain fixed income amounts in those jurisdictions 
our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of income taxes associated with our foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates different from the us federal statutory rate  as well as the timing and extent of the realization of deferred tax assets  changes in the tax law and potential acquisitions 
further  we believe that our tax rate may fluctuate within a fiscal year  including from quarter to quarter  due to potential items arising from discrete events  including settlements of claims  acquisitions of other companies or other similar events 
we currently believe that our fiscal effective tax rate will be in the range of to  subject to any material changes in these factors 
we have established a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets  consisting principally of net operating loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions including the united states  because we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax assets in those jurisdictions will not be realized prior to their expiration 
at june   we had total net deferred tax assets of  net of a tax asset valuation allowance of million and deferred tax liabilities of  realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the related tax jurisdictions 
we believe that sufficient taxable income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
business combinations over the past three fiscal years  we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries 
during this time period  we acquired the following businesses date company details january american msi corporation the acquisition of american msi corporation provided us advanced hot runner process controller products that assure that materials are kept in an optimal state until injected into the part cavity during the manufacturing process

recent accounting pronouncements we believe that there are no recent accounting pronouncements that will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position that have not been previously disclosed 
impact of inflation we believe that our revenue and results of operations have not been significantly impacted by inflation during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe that our revenue and results of operations will be significantly impacted by inflation in future periods 
risk factors and important factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties prior to making an investment in our common stock 
the following risks and uncertainties may also cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in or predicted by our forward looking statements 
our business model is changing as we further develop and exploit our manufacturing solutions products  and our recent reorganization of our sales  marketing and support staff along business unit lines may result in disruption in our sales 
the development and implementation of a robust set of manufacturing solutions products has required that we devote significant research and development  marketing and executive level resources to this product family 
further expenditures of time and effort will be required in order to maximize the potential of this set of products 
we recently completed the acquisition of amsi  a provider of hot runner process controllers  with products focused solely on the manufacturing market 
in connection with this acquisition  we reorganized our business into two strategically focused business units  one focused on design analysis solutions products and one on manufacturing solutions products 
this change in organizational structure may lead to further disruption in our business operations  as we have split our direct sales force into product specific sales forces  each of which will be reporting directly to the responsible business unit leader 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by significant delays in developing  completing or shipping our new or enhanced manufacturing solutions products as well as by delays in acceptance of these products by customers 
because these products interact with other factory or enterprise wide systems  we may be required to provide additional functionality or services  which may delay the recognition of revenue 
further  our acquisition of amsi may delay the development and completion of our manufacturing solutions products as we seek to integrate newly acquired technology into our product platform 
our manufacturing solutions business unit is managed by the former chief executive officer and sole stockholder of amsi and our ability to successfully integrate and further develop the amsi business will be dependent on our ability to retain this employee 
a general economic slowdown  particularly in our end markets  may continue to impact our results 
the demand for our products is largely driven by the demand for the products in our primary end markets 
many of these end markets  particularly the automotive  telecommunications and electronics industries experienced severe economic declines which significantly and adversely affected our business in fiscal and while general economic trends have improved in some geographic markets  continuation of this general economic slowdown  particularly in the discrete manufacturing industry  could materially and adversely affect us by decreasing our revenue as compared to prior years  or by lowering our revenue growth 

table of contents we are dependent on third parties such as resellers and distributors to distribute a substantial portion of our manufacturing solutions products 
following the acquisition of amsi  we now distribute a substantial portion of our manufacturing solutions products through a network of independent  regional channel partners 
in addition  we are adding more channel partners in geographically dispersed locations in order to sell our products to new customers 
the channel partners sell our products to new and existing customers  expand installations within their existing customer base  offer consulting services and provide the first line of technical support 
consequently  we are highly dependent on the efforts of the channel partners 
difficulties in ongoing relationships with channel partners  such as delays in collecting accounts receivable  failure to meet performance criteria or to promote our products as aggressively as we expect  and differences in the handling of customer relationships could adversely affect our performance 
additionally  the loss of any major channel partner for any reason  including a channel partner s decision to sell competing products rather than our products  could have a material adverse effect on us 
moreover  our future success will depend substantially on the ability and willingness of our channel partners to continue to dedicate the resources necessary to promote our products and to support a larger installed base of our products following our acquisition of amsi 
if the channel partners are unable or unwilling to do so  we may be unable to achieve revenue growth with respect to the products sold primarily through this channel 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and  as a result  period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we have experienced significant historical fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly basis 
we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our future quarterly results of operations due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including seasonal slowdowns  in particular  in our first fiscal quarter  in many of the markets in which we sell our products  changes in the mix of products and services we provide because sales of our manufacturing solutions products and our services will result in lower gross margins and may result in a longer selling cycle  which effect may be more significant following the acquisition of amsi  which will result in a higher percentage of sales coming from our manufacturing solutions products as compared to our design analysis solutions products  the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures  including costs relating to the expansion of our operations and infrastructure  and planned program spending  such as that required for major marketing initiatives or tradeshows  introductions of new services or enhancements by us and our competitors and changes in our and our competitors pricing policies  our increased use of third parties such as distributors and resellers which may lessen the control we have over revenue and earnings during any particular period  the timing and magnitude of our tax expense  resulting from the globally distributed nature of our selling and research and development operations that may lead to increased taxable income in certain jurisdictions that may not yet be offset by losses in other tax jurisdictions  fluctuations in our tax rate from quarter to quarter due to the impact of discrete events  including the settlement of claims  the acquisition of other companies or other events  currency and exchange rate fluctuations  and timing and integration of acquisitions 
in addition  like many software companies  we usually record a larger percentage of our quarterly revenue in the third month of the fiscal quarter 
also  our manufacturing solutions products may involve a longer selling cycle with corresponding larger order sizes which may lead to an inability to close on orders or make 
table of contents shipments in the period immediately preceding the end of the fiscal quarter 
accordingly  our quarterly results are often difficult to predict prior to the final days of the quarter 
if we experience delays in introducing new products or if our existing or new products do not achieve market acceptance  we may lose revenue 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  changes in end user requirements  intense competition  technically complex products  frequent new product introductions  and evolving offerings by product manufacturers 
we believe our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate or adapt to these factors and to offer on a timely basis products that meet customer demands 
for example  the introduction of new products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render our existing products obsolete 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements and result in unexpected expenses 
our growth and profitability also will depend upon our ability to expand the use and market penetration of our existing product lines as well as new products we introduce 
market acceptance of our products will depend in part on our ability to demonstrate the cost effectiveness  ease of use and technological advantages of our products over competing products 
our recent acquisition of amsi and any future mergers  acquisitions and strategic relationships may result in lost revenue caused by business disruptions and missed opportunities caused by the distraction of our management 
in january we acquired american msi corporation  a privately held company specializing in development and sale of hot runner process controllers for the plastics processing industry 
further  we may engage in other acquisitions and strategic relationships in the future 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  and  if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make such acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
if we merge with or acquire another company including amsi  we will only receive the anticipated benefits if we successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner 
we will have to devote a significant amount of time  management and financial resources to do so 
even with this investment of management and financial resources  the acquisition of amsi or another business may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital  management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve non recurring charges and amortization of significant amounts of acquired identifiable intangible assets that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the reorganization of our sales force may lead to disruption in our sales activity 
late in fiscal  we made certain changes to our overall business by creating two separate business units focused on our two product lines 
along with this change  we reorganized our worldwide sales force 

table of contents these changes may result in a decrease in sales productivity which would lead to a decrease in revenue in one or both of our business units 
future restructurings of the sales force could result in further transition issues and could adversely impact our revenue and financial condition 
if we become subject to intellectual property infringement claims  we could incur significant expenses and we could be prevented from offering specific products or services 
our products include proprietary intellectual property 
we may become subject to claims that we infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
in the united states and elsewhere  a significant number of software and business method patents have been issued over the past decade and the holders of these patents have been actively seeking out potential infringers 
in addition  our manufacturing solutions products require interaction with an injection molding machine  the use and technology of which are subject to a wide variety of worldwide patents and other intellectual property protection 
if any element of our products or services violates third party proprietary rights  we might not be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms to continue offering our products or services without substantial re engineering and any effort to undertake such re engineering might not be successful 
in addition  any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
any judgment against us could require us to pay substantial damages and could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products and services 
we may lose sales if we are unable to protect important intellectual property 
our ability to compete effectively against other companies in our industry will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our technology 
we may be unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
we face the following risks in protecting our intellectual property we cannot be certain that our pending united states and foreign patent applications will result in issued patents or that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology  third parties may design around our patented technologies or seek to challenge or invalidate our patented technologies  patents of others may have an adverse effect on our ability to do business  the contractual provisions that we rely on  in part  to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach and our trade secrets and proprietary information may be disclosed to the public  our trade secrets may also become known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors  foreign countries  including some of those in which we do business  may reduce or limit the protection of our intellectual property rights and software piracy  particularly in certain countries in asia  may result in lost revenue in those countries or to customers with worldwide operations  and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights may reduce our future profitability 
our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by international business risks 
the majority of our employees  including sales  support and research and development personnel  are located outside of the united states 
similarly  the majority of our revenue is derived from customers outside the united states and certain intellectual property is owned by subsidiary companies located outside the united states 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to numerous risks  including decreased liquidity resulting from longer accounts receivable collection cycles typical of certain foreign countries  
table of contents decreased revenue on foreign sales resulting from possible foreign currency exchange and conversion issues  lower productivity resulting from difficulties managing our sales  support and research and development operations across many countries  decreased earnings based on changes in tax regulations in foreign jurisdictions or the timing of required tax payments in foreign jurisdictions that may not yet be offset by tax benefits arising from losses in other jurisdictions  lost revenue resulting from difficulties associated with enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  lost revenue resulting from the imposition by foreign governments of trade protection measures  and higher cost of sales resulting from import or export licensing requirements 
we have more limited financial and other resources than many of our competitors and potential competitors and may be unable to compete successfully against them 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to successfully compete 
companies in our industry and entities in similar industries could decide to focus on the development of software solutions for the design  analysis and manufacture of injection molded plastic parts 
many of these entities have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share 
disruption of operations at our development or manufacturing facilities could interfere with our product development and production cycles 
a significant portion of our computer equipment  source code and personnel  including critical resources dedicated to research and development  are presently located at operating facilities in australia  the united states and europe 
our manufacturing operations are performed in the united states and ireland  using both in house and contract manufacturing facilities 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated catastrophe at any of these facilities could cause interruptions in our operations and services 
extensive or multiple interruptions in our operations at our development or manufacturing facilities could severely disrupt our operations 
our manufacturing solutions products may lead to product liability claims against us 
our manufacturing solutions products are installed directly on our customers injection molding machines and  in certain cases  automatically adjust the operation of these machines 
as a result  it is possible that our customers may claim that our product interfered with the proper operation of their machines and may seek reimbursement for consequential and other damages from us 
although we expressly disclaim any liability for consequential or other damages in connection with our sale of these products  this disclaimer may not protect us from claims for damages from our customers and these claims may adversely affect our relationships with our customers or our reputation generally 
in addition  our insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us against any product liability claims that arise 
this insurance is expensive and may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we make estimates in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
we make significant estimates in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
these estimates are subject to many transactions  calculations and proceedings where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
these proceedings currently include customary inquiry activities by various taxing authorities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final outcome of tax matters and proceedings could be different than the estimates reflected in the historical income tax provision and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on income tax expense and net income in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents if we are required to expense options granted under our employee stock plans as compensation  our net income and earnings per share would be significantly reduced 
in the past  we have used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock options provide an incentive to our employees to maximize long term shareholder value and can encourage valued employees to remain with the company 
certain proposals related to accounting for the grant of an employee stock option as an expense have been issued for comment by the financial accounting standards board 
if such proposals are implemented  our net income and earnings per share will be negatively impacted 
our stock price is highly volatile and our stock price could experience substantial declines and our management s attention may be diverted from more productive tasks 
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  the per share price of our common stock has experienced significant volatility since we have been a public company 
many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to decline  including revenues and operating results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors in any quarter  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions  changes in our senior management personnel  distribution or sale of shares of our common stock by insiders or affiliated persons  including the shares received by the selling stockholder in connection with the acquisition of amsi  a portion of which have been registered for resale on form s and could therefore be sold at any time  technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  a decrease in the demand for our common stock  investor perception of our industry or our prospects  and general technology or economic trends 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
we may be involved in securities class action litigation in the future 
such litigation often results in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop our products in research centers in australia  the united kingdom  france and the united states 
we sell our products globally through our direct sales force and indirect distributor channels 
as a result  our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  political climate and economic conditions in foreign markets 
in the future  we expect to increase our international operations in our existing markets and in geographic locations where we do not have any operations now 
we collect amounts representing a substantial portion of our revenues and pay amounts representing a substantial portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies 
as a result  changes in currency exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results and our invested cash balances 
during  our consolidated cash balances were impacted favorably by the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  particularly with respect to the australian dollar 
at june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents invested in foreign currency accounts 
our consolidated cash position will continue to be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we engage in hedging transactions designed to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
we cannot assure you  however  that any efforts we make to hedge our exposure to currency exchange rate changes will be successful

our invested cash balances are subject to interest rate risk and  as a result  changes in interest rates from time to time may affect our operating results 
we invest our excess cash balances in highly liquid  interest bearing instruments  including government and corporate bonds 
at june   the fair value and principal amounts of our bond portfolio amounted to million  with a yield to maturity of 
our investments are limited to high grade corporate debt securities  government issued debt  municipal debt securities  money market funds and similar high quality instruments 
in a declining interest rate environment  we would experience a decrease in interest income 
the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment 
since january  the united states federal reserve and european central bank have significantly decreased certain benchmark interest rates  which has led to a general decline in market interest rates 
this decline in market interest rates has resulted in a significant decrease in our interest income over the past three years 
our interest income will continue to fluctuate based upon changes in market interest rates and levels of cash available for investment 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
however  given the relatively short maturities and investment grade quality of our marketable securities portfolio  a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse effect on the fair value of these instruments 
these instruments potentially expose us to credit risk  however  we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
however  those guidelines limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
in addition  our accounts receivable from our customers expose us to credit risk 
we believe that such credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers comprising our accounts receivable and their broad dispersion over geographic regions and industries
