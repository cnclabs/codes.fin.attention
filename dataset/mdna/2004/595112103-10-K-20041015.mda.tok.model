factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to  those identified in certain factors 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended september  all period references are to the company s fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated 
all per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis 
all tabular dollar amounts are in millions 
unless otherwise stated  all production data reflects production of the company and its tech joint venture 
overview the company is a global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor memory devices  principally dram and flash  and cmos image sensor devices 
its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers  workstations  servers  cell phones  digital still cameras  and other consumer and industrial products 
the company s customers are principally original equipment manufacturers and memory module retailers located around the globe 
the markets for the company s products behave in a manner similar to commodity markets as the products are generally standardized with selling prices that fluctuate based on industry wide relationships of supply and demand 
enhancing operating results and strengthening financial condition in these types of markets is likely dependent upon leading the industry in low cost production  capital efficiency and return on research and development investments 
historically  the semiconductor memory market has been subject to subsidization  thereby leading to the entry of new competitors and  at times  excess supply 
the company s proprietary product and process technology allows sophisticated semiconductor memory and imaging devices to be manufactured with progressively smaller die sizes 
historically  the company has been able to reduce the cost of its memory products by implementing new product and process technologies 
these new technologies enable the company to produce more megabits of memory on each wafer  primarily by reducing the size of the circuits shrinking that make up each memory cell 
in  the company introduced products featuring its f hypershrink array architecture technology that enables it to further increase megabits produced per wafer 
this f technology reduces the size of memory cells approximately from industry standard f products without significant additional investment in equipment 
the company continually introduces new generations of products that offer lower costs per megabit and improved performance characteristics such as higher data transfer rates  reduced package size per megabit and lower power consumption 
the company has made substantial investments in its manufacturing facilities in the united states  europe and asia 
a significant portion of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is replaced every three to five years with more advanced equipment to process leading edge technology and reduce cost per part 
because the company owns most of its manufacturing capacity  a significant portion of the company s operating costs are fixed 
in general  these costs do not vary with changes in the company s utilization of its manufacturing capacity and  accordingly  margins fluctuate with utilization 
the company must generate sufficient cash flow from operations for reinvestment in manufacturing capability or obtain external financing 
historically  the company has accessed external markets to fund a portion of its cash requirements 
maximizing returns from investments in research and development r d is dependent on developing process technology that effectively reduces production costs  leveraging required investments across a substantial scale of production  and designing new products that can be successfully brought to market 
the company must invest heavily in r d to expand its product offering and enable development of leading edge product and process technologies 
the company has made significant r d investments in recent periods to develop products that will enable it to enter new markets 
in recent years  approximately of the company s products were sold into computer and computer peripheral markets 
the computing market for a number of decades has had an extremely high growth rate 
as with any maturing market  it is likely that future growth rates will more closely parallel broader macroeconomic trends 
the company is strategically diversifying its business into semiconductor products other than core dram 
the company s non core dram products include specialty memory  flash memory and cmos image sensors 
these products leverage the company s competencies in semiconductor memory manufacturing and product and process technology 
non core dram products are typically of lower density and are manufactured in lower volumes than core dram  and allow the company to use prior generation processes and equipment 
unlike core dram  these products are typically used in electronic devices other than computers and in many cases the company can differentiate them from competitor s products based on performance characteristics 
markets for some of the company s non dram products are expected to grow rapidly  in particular the markets for nand flash and cmos image sensors 
the company believes that its product and process technology and manufacturing competencies position it well to compete in these markets 
accordingly  the company plans to allocate an increasing portion of its manufacturing capacity to these products in success in these markets is dependent in part on the company s ability to timely develop new products that are well received by customers and gain sufficient market share 
results of operations amounts in millions and as a percent of net sales net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative research and development restructure and other charges operating income loss the company s fiscal year is the or week period ending on the thursday closest to august the company s fiscal contained weeks 
net sales net sales for increased by as compared to primarily due to a increase in megabits sold and a increase in average per megabit selling prices for the company s memory products as a result of generally improved market conditions 
during  the company increased its allocation of manufacturing capacity to specialty memory products  including pseudo static ram psram  cmos image sensors and legacy dram products 
the shift in product mix contributed to the increase in average per megabit selling prices for as specialty memory products and legacy dram products on average had higher selling prices per megabit than the company s core dram products 
the company s overall megabit production for increased approximately from primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies 
the growth rate in megabit production for was constrained in part by the allocation of wafers to cmos image sensors  specialty memory products and legacy dram products which do not require leading edge process technology and therefore inherently have a lower production growth rate than the company s advanced core dram products 
megabit output per wafer is also lower for specialty memory and legacy dram products because of their relatively lower density and greater complexity 
further  the company s diversification of product mix and prioritization of specialty memory products necessitated production changes to optimize long term wafer process efficiency that resulted in a temporary reduction of wafer output in ddr products constituted of the company s net sales for both and and of net sales in for  megabit production was slightly higher than megabit sales 
finished goods inventories at the end of remained at relatively low levels 
the company expects to achieve significant growth in megabit production during from manufacturing efficiencies and increased wafer output resulting from the production ramp of its mm wafer fabrication facility 
growth in future megabit production over the next several quarters  however  is expected to be adversely affected by an increased allocation of wafers to the manufacture of ddr products  which have a relatively larger die size  cmos image sensors  specialty memory products and flash memory 
net sales for increased by as compared to  primarily due to a increase in megabits of memory sold 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices in as compared to for the company s semiconductor memory products 
megabits produced increased in as compared to  principally due to manufacturing efficiencies 
gross margin the company s reported gross margin percentage for increased to from a negative for primarily due to the increase in average per megabit selling prices and reduced costs per megabit 
in addition  compared to  reported gross margin for benefited from relatively higher margins on sales of products purchased from the company s tech joint venture 
the company reduced its overall average cost per megabit for as compared to through manufacturing efficiencies achieved by improving product yields and continuing its transition to products utilizing nm process technology and f technology 
the company s f technology enables it to produce approximately more potential die per wafer than standard products  which use f technology 
per megabit cost reductions in the near term will be limited by the effects of increased production of ddr products and specialty memory products but the company expects that average selling prices per megabit for these products will be higher than its primary ddr product 
per megabit cost reductions will also be limited by higher costs associated with the limited volumes of production at the company s mm manufacturing facility in virginia 
the company s reported gross margin for improved as compared to  primarily due to a decrease in per megabit manufacturing costs  partially offset by the decrease in average selling prices for the company s semiconductor products and the net effects of inventory write downs 
the company was able to significantly reduce per megabit manufacturing costs in through improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 
during  the company completed its migration to nm process technology and continued to transition to nm technology 
inventory write downs the company records charges to cost of goods sold in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to write down the carrying values of work in process and finished goods inventories when they exceed their estimated market values 
the inventory write downs reflect estimates of future market pricing relative to the costs of production and inventory carrying values and projected timing of product sales 
many of the company s semiconductor components have characteristics similar to commodities that are generally standardized products with selling prices that fluctuate significantly based on industry wide relationships of supply and demand 
in recent years  a combination of global economic conditions and a slowing growth rate in demand for personal computers  coupled with worldwide increases in semiconductor production capacity  caused significant declines in average selling prices for semiconductor components 
in all quarters of fiscal and  market values of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date were below the company s manufacturing cost of these products and the company recognized a charge to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of inventories to their estimated market values 
as such charges are recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the write down is sold  gross margins in the period of sale are higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous write downs 
no write down was necessary for and  as of september   only a de minimis amount of previous write downs remains in ending inventory 
as a result  write downs of inventories prior to will not have a significant effect on operating results in future periods 
the following table sets forth adjusted gross margins absent the inventory write downs and the estimated effect of previous write downs 
these write downs may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature but are a result of significant market driven declines in average selling prices 
the presentation of these adjusted amounts vary from numbers presented in accordance with us gaap and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies 
however  the company believes this information is significant to understanding the company s gross margins and analyzing the company s gross margin trends 
this non gaap information is important to analyzing the company s cost of goods sold since the effect of inventory write downs must be separated from the manufacturing cost component in order to have a reasonable basis for understanding trends in cost of goods sold 
when evaluating performance and making decisions on how to allocate company resources  management uses this non gaap data and believes investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions 
amounts in millions and as a percent of net sales gross margin as reported inventory write downs estimated effect of previous write downs as adjusted inventory write downs are calculated based on estimates of future market pricing relative to the company s costs of production and inventory carrying values and the projected timing of product sales 
the reduction in cost of goods sold resulting from sales of written down inventory is reflected as the estimated effect of previous write downs in the table above 
the estimated effect of previous write downs is calculated by computing cost of goods sold for each applicable period as if no write downs had been recorded and comparing it to cost of goods sold as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in calculating the estimated effect of previous write downs  the company uses the same judgments and estimates that are used to calculate cost of goods sold 
tech semiconductor singapore pte 
ltd 
tech the tech joint venture supplied approximately  and of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in  and  respectively 
the company generally purchases memory products from tech at prices determined quarterly  based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the company for the immediately preceding quarter 
depending on market conditions  the gross margin from the sale of tech products may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by the company s wholly owned operations 
in  and  the company realized higher gross margin percentages on sales of tech products than for products manufactured by its wholly owned operations 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for were lower than for primarily due to lower costs associated with outstanding legal matters and reduced depreciation costs  partially offset by higher levels of performance based compensation expense and other personnel costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for were higher than for primarily due to higher costs associated with outstanding legal matters 
sg a expenses for the first quarter of are expected to approximate million 
research and development research and development r d expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed  the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development  and personnel costs 
because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the company s products  the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing 
the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability 
r d expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 
r d expenses for increased from principally due to an increase in development wafers processed during as the company increased its product diversification and ramped production at its mm wafer fabrication facility  which primarily ran development wafers in higher r d costs in also reflect a higher level of expenses related to cmos image sensors  flash memory and specialty memory products 
r d expenses for increased from primarily due to an increase in development wafers processed as the company expanded its product development efforts and began ramping production of mm development wafers 
r d expenses for the first quarter of are expected to approximate million 
the company s process technology r d efforts are focused primarily on development of nm  nm and smaller line width process technologies  which are designed to facilitate the company s transition to next generation products 
additional r d efforts include process development to support the company s mm wafer manufacturing  cmos image sensors  flash memory  specialty memory products including psram and reduced latency dram rldram and new manufacturing materials 
efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on the company s meg and gig ddr  ddr and ddr dram products as well as nand flash memory  cmos image sensors and specialty memory products 
restructure and other charges in the second quarter of the company announced a plan to restructure its operations 
the restructure plan included the shutdown of the company s mm production line in virginia  the discontinuance of certain memory products  including sram and tcam products  and an approximate reduction of the company s worldwide workforce 
in connection with the plan  the company recorded million of restructure charges and additional restructure related charges of million  which are included in cost of goods sold for the credit to restructure in primarily reflects gains on sales of equipment associated with operations shut down in the restructure 
the generally higher equipment sales prices reflect improved market conditions across the semiconductor industry 
the company has substantially completed the restructure plan 
as of august   the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses included million for remaining costs accrued in connection with the restructure plan 
through september   the company had paid essentially all of the severance and other termination benefits and other costs incurred in connection with the restructure plan 
the components of the restructure charge and additional restructure related charges were as follows amounts in millions restructure charge write down of equipment severance and other termination benefits write down of intangible assets other total restructure charge other charges to write down raw materials and work in process inventories total restructure and other charges other operating expense  net other operating expense for includes losses of million from changes in currency exchange rates

other operating expense for is net of million in receipts from the us government in connection with anti dumping tariffs 
other operating expense for includes net losses on write downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of million 
income taxes income taxes for  and primarily reflect taxes on the company s non us operations 
non us operating results are not expected to reflect an income tax provision  until such time as the company utilizes a substantial portion of its us net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits  as any such provision is substantially offset by a corresponding reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
as of september   the company had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of billion and unused us tax credits of million  which expire through the company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of billion for tax purposes which expire through and unused state tax credits of million for tax and financial reporting purposes which expire through liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products and the timing of capital expenditures  both of which can vary significantly from period to period 
as of september   the company had cash and marketable investments totaling  million compared to million as of august  operating activities for  net cash provided by operating activities was  million primarily reflecting improved average selling prices for semiconductor memory products 
cash generated from operations in principally reflects the company s million of income adjusted by  million for non cash depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a million increase in inventories consisting primarily of work in process inventories resulting from transitions in the company s product mix and a million increase in accounts receivable associated with the company s higher level of sales 
investing activities for  net cash used by investing activities was  million including expenditures for property  plant and equipment of  million 
the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  it must continue to invest in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
the company expects capital spending to approximate billion 
as of september   the company had commitments extending into of approximately million for the acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
financing activities for  net cash provided by financing activities was million including million received from intel corporation intel 
payments on equipment purchase contracts and debt were million for in  the company received million in net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable and sales leaseback transactions 
in the first quarter of  the company paid million to toshiba corporation to redeem the million shares of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of the company s virginia facility from toshiba 
in the first quarter of  the company received million from intel in exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable into approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
in conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights  the company agreed to achieve operational objectives through may  including certain levels of ddr production and mm wafer processing capacity 
in the event the company fails to achieve certain milestones and the company s common stock price is then below intel s per share purchase price of  the company could be obligated to pay intel amounts not to exceed million  a substantial portion of which is payable  at the company s election  in the company s common stock 
in the second quarter of  the company issued million of convertible subordinated notes the notes 
holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes at any time prior to maturity  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  into the company s common stock at a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of the notes 
this conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the company may redeem the notes at any time after february   at declining premiums to par 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  the company purchased call spread options the call spread options covering million shares of the company s common stock  which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the notes in full 
the call spread options have a lower strike price of  a higher strike price of  may be settled at the company s option either in cash or net shares and expire on january  settlement of the call spread options in cash on january   would result in the company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the company s common stock is at or below to a maximum of million if the market price per share of the company s common stock is at or above 
during the fourth quarter of  the company received million from the issuance of warrants to purchase million shares of the company s common stock 
the warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of common stock for per share the exercise price at any time through may  the expiration date 
warrants exercised prior to the expiration date will be settled on a net share basis  wherein investors receive common stock equal to the difference between and the average closing sale price for the common shares over the trading days immediately preceding the exercise date 
at expiration  the company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash  provided certain conditions are satisfied 
as of september   there have been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remain outstanding 
access to capital markets has historically been important to the company 
depending on market conditions  the company may  from time to time  issue registered or unregistered securities to raise capital to fund a portion of its operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total less than year years years more than years amounts in millions notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on the company s balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of long term debt 
the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  market prices or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria they are noncancelable  the company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled  or the company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services take or pay 
if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable  the entire value of the contract was included in the above table 
if the obligation is cancelable  but the company would incur a penalty if cancelled  the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation 
contracted minimum amounts specified in take or pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 
the company has an agreement with its tech joint venture to purchase all of tech s output of semiconductor memory components subject to specific terms and conditions 
as the purchase quantities are based on qualified production output  the agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore the company did not include the agreement in its purchase obligations 
in addition to purchase quantities  the tech purchase obligation fluctuates based on average selling prices for semiconductor memory components which can change significantly from period to period 
in  the net cost of semiconductor components purchased from tech was million 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 which provides guidance on the identification of and reporting for variable interest entities 
the company adopted interpretation no 
in the third quarter of adoption of interpretation no 
did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
contingencies the company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
income taxes the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
the company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap  which requires the assessment of the company s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets 
realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent on the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
cost includes labor  material and overhead costs  including product and process technology costs 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories 
to project average selling prices and sales volumes  the company reviews recent sales volumes  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry analysis of supply and demand  seasonal factors  general economic trends and other information 
when these analyses reflect estimated market values below the company s manufacturing costs  the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold 
differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of write down recorded 
due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry  actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and  as a result  the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 
us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values 
the amount of any inventory write down can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories 
the company s inventory has been categorized as semiconductor memory products or cmos image sensors 
the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 
product and process technology costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over periods currently ranging up to years 
the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed 
capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology  ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement 
property  plant and equipment the company reviews the carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and or disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the company  including  but not limited to  future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets  future selling prices for the company s products and future production and sales volumes 
in addition  judgment is required by the company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 
research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred 
determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the company 
the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability 
certain factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form k  the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our memory products which have adversely affected our business 
in several recent years  we experienced annual decreases in per megabit average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products including in  in  in  in  in and in at times  average selling prices for our semiconductor products have been below our costs 
if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
increased worldwide dram production or lack of demand for dram could lead to further declines in average selling prices for dram 
the transition to smaller line width process technologies and mm wafers in the industry could  depending upon the rate of transition  lead to a significant increase in the worldwide supply of dram 
increases in worldwide supply of dram also result from dram fab capacity expansions  either by way of new facilities  increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to dram production 
several of our competitors have announced plans to increase production through construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities 
increases in worldwide supply of dram  if not offset by increases in demand  could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as the computer industry matures and the growth rate of computers sold or growth rate of the amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer decreases  sales of our semiconductor products could decrease 
we are dependent on the computing market as most of the semiconductor products we sell are used in computers  servers or peripheral products 
approximately of our sales of semiconductor products for were to the computing market 
drams are the most widely used semiconductor memory components in computers 
in recent years  the growth rate of computers sold has slowed or declined largely due to the maturation of the computer industry 
the reduction in the growth rate of computers sold or growth rate of the average amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer could reduce sales of our semiconductor products and our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past 
historically  we have decreased per megabit manufacturing costs through improvements in our manufacturing processes  including reducing the die size of our existing products 
in future periods  we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs or reduce costs at historical rates 
we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance 
each generation of new products adds complexity to the manufacturing process and the initial production of new products is typically characterized by relatively high costs due to lower product yields  reduced wafer throughput and less efficient use of assets 
reduction of per megabit manufacturing costs in future periods is dependent on our ability to successfully develop product and process technology  including future transitions to nm and smaller line width process technologies  ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across facilities  achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing wafer output and yields  which may decrease as we implement more complex technologies  including our transition to mm wafer processing  and offset increases in per megabit manufacturing costs resulting from shifts in product mix to cmos image sensors  specialty memory products and flash memory 
if we are unable to timely and efficiently convert our manufacturing operations to mm wafer processing  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in  we began ramping production of mm wafers at our wafer fabrication facility in virginia 
as of the end of  production at the virginia facility had not reached levels necessary to achieve mature product yield and cost efficient utilization of the facility 
until such time that production at the virginia facility reaches mature product yields and significant volume with regards to capacity utilization  it will adversely affect our results of operations 
we are assessing which of our other facilities will be converted to mm wafer fabrication and when those facilities will be converted 
we may also experience disruptions in manufacturing operations  reduced wafer output and reduced yields during our conversion of other facilities to mm wafers 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 
our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold  average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs 
to develop new product and process technologies  support future growth  achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality  we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology  facilities and capital equipment  research and development  and product and process technology 
in addition to cash provided by operations  we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing 
depending on general market and economic conditions or other factors  we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments or access capital markets for funds on acceptable terms 
the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 
we face intense competition from a number of companies  including elpida memory  inc  hynix semiconductor inc  infineon technologies ag and samsung electronics co  ltd 
additionally  we face competition from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations 
some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete  invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities 
our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity  improve yields  reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs 
these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 
historically  various governments have provided economic assistance to international competitors  which has enabled  or artificially supported  competitors production of semiconductor memory  particularly dram 
this factor may continue to increase the supply of dram and other semiconductor products in future periods 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and are reported in us dollars 
across our multi national operations there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen and euro 
in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the japanese yen or euro  reported results of operations or financial condition will be adversely affected 
current economic and political conditions may harm our business 
throughout most of the s and s  industry revenue for the dram market grew at a much faster rate than the overall economy  driven by both growth in sales of computers and the amount of memory included in each computer sold 
in recent years  the dram market has grown at a significantly slower rate as the computer industry has continued to mature 
as a result  we expect that trends in the dram and computer industries will more closely parallel broader macroeconomic events and trends 
global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce 
if these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if  for any reason  we are unable to access the capital markets over an extended period of time  we may be unable to make property  plant and equipment expenditures  implement our research and development efforts or fund our operations  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if our tech joint venture experiences financial difficulty  or if our supply of semiconductor products from tech is disrupted  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
tech supplied approximately of our total megabits of memory produced in we have agreements to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech subject to specific terms and conditions 
in recent periods  we have realized higher margins on products purchased from tech than products manufactured by our wholly owned facilities 
any reduction in supply could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as of september   we had intangible assets with a net book value of million relating to the supply arrangement to purchase product from tech 
in the event that our supply of semiconductor products from tech is reduced or eliminated  we may be required to write off part or all of these assets and our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 
if we are unable to respond to customer demand for diversified semiconductor memory products or are unable to do so in a cost effective manner  we may lose market share and our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in recent periods  the semiconductor memory market has become increasingly segmented  with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of desktop and notebook computers  servers  workstations  handheld devices  and communications  industrial and other applications that demand specific memory solutions 
we offer customers a variety of semiconductor memory products  including ddr  ddr  sdram  edo  flash and psram 
we need to dedicate significant resources to product design and development to respond to customer demand for the continued diversification of semiconductor products 
if we are unable to invest sufficient resources to meet the diverse memory needs of customers  we may lose market share 
in addition  as we diversify our product lines we may encounter difficulties penetrating certain markets  particularly markets where we do not have existing customers 
if we are unable to respond to customer demand for market diversification in a cost effective manner  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries  from time to time  others have asserted  and may in the future assert  that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights 
we are engaged in litigation with rambus  inc rambus relating to certain of rambus patents and certain of our claims and defenses 
on august   we filed a complaint amended against rambus in us district court for the district of delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief 
among other things  our amended complaint alleges violation of federal antitrust laws  breach of contract  fraud  deceptive trade practices  and negligent misrepresentation 
the complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment a that certain rambus patents are not infringed by us  are invalid  and or are unenforceable b that we have an implied license to those patents and c that rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us 
on february   rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in delaware denying that we are entitled to relief  alleging infringement of the eight rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment claim  and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
a number of other suits are currently pending in europe alleging that certain of our sdram and ddr sdram products infringe various of rambus country counterparts to its european patent  including on september   rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim  germany  on september   rambus filed suit against micron europe limited in the high court of justice  chancery division in london  england  on september   rambus filed a complaint against us and reptronic a distributor of our products in court of first instance of paris  france  on september   we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of milan  italy  alleging invalidity and non infringement 
in addition  on december   we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of avezzano  italy  alleging invalidity and non infringement of the italian counterpart to european patent on august   rambus filed suit against us and assitec an electronics retailer in the civil court of pavia  italy  alleging that certain ddr sdram products infringe the italian counterpart to european patent in the european suits against us  rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief 
we also are engaged in litigation with motorola  inc motorola and freescale semiconductor  inc  a subsidiary of motorola freescale  relating to certain of our patents and certain of freescale s patents 
on january   motorola filed suit against us in the us district court for the western district of texas austin alleging infringement of ten motorola patents 
on march   we filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging infringement of seventeen of our patents 
freescale was later added as a party with motorola 
on march   we filed a separate action against motorola in the us district court for the western district of wisconsin madison alleging infringement of six additional of our patents  and we added a seventh patent in an amended complaint filed on april  on june   the wisconsin court granted motorola s motion to transfer the case to texas  and the two cases subsequently were consolidated 
the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our sdram and ddr dram products  which account for a significant portion of our net sales 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these suits 
a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability and or require us to make material changes to our products and or manufacturing processes 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements 
some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments 
we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future 
we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 
allegations of antitrust violations 
on june   we received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the northern district of california seeking information regarding an investigation by the antitrust division of the department of justice the doj into possible antitrust violations in the dynamic random access memory or dram industry 
we are cooperating fully and actively with the doj in its investigation of the dram industry 
subsequent to the commencement of the doj investigation  a number of purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and other dram suppliers

we are unable to predict the outcome of these suits 
based upon our analysis of the claims made and the nature of the dram industry  we believe that class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs would be more appropriately resolved on a customer by customer basis 
we can give no assurance that final resolution of these civil suits will not result in significant liability and will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
allegations of anticompetitive conduct 
on may   rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers 
the complaint alleges certain causes of action under california state law including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on rambus dram rdram  conspiracy to monopolize various relevant markets  intentional interference with prospective economic advantage relating to rdram  and unfair competition to disadvantage rdram 
the complaint seeks treble damages  punitive damages  attorneys fees  costs  and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint 
we are unable to predict the outcome of the suit 
a court determination against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
new product development may be unsuccessful 
we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology 
we anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years 
there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful  that we will be able to cost effectively manufacture these new products  that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts 
we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
sales to customers outside the united states approximated of our consolidated net sales for in addition  we have manufacturing operations in italy  japan  puerto rico  scotland and singapore 
our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  export duties  changes to import and export regulations  and restrictions on the transfer of funds  political and economic instability  problems with the transportation or delivery of our products  issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest  longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  and compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions 
these factors may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
if our manufacturing process is disrupted  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance 
difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs 
from time to time  we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages or equipment failures 
if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason  manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers 
this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships  which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 
disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards 
we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials 
however  only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards 
various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers  photomasks  chemicals  gases  lead frames and molding compound 
shortages may occur from time to time in the future 
in addition  any transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials 
lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past 
if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to achieve certain milestones  we could be obligated to pay intel corporation amounts up to million 
in conjunction with the issuance of stock rights to intel in september  we agreed to achieve operational objectives through may  including certain levels of ddr production and mm wafer processing capacity 
if we fail to achieve certain milestones and our common stock price is then below intel s purchase price of  we could be obligated to pay intel amounts up to million  a substantial portion of which is payable  at our election  in our common stock 
products that do not meet specifications or that contain  or are perceived by our customers to contain  defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex  it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications  contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses 
if  despite design review  quality control and product qualification procedures  problems with nonconforming  defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products  we could be adversely affected in the following ways we may replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product  and we may encounter adverse publicity  which could cause a decrease in sales of our products 
we expect to make future acquisitions where advisable  which involve numerous risks 
we expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance shareholder value 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including increasing our exposure to changes in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products  difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities  increasing debt to finance any acquisition  diverting management s attention from normal daily operations  managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  and hiring and retaining key employees 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  and future acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk substantially all of the company s investments are at fixed interest rates  therefore  the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of investments is minimal as the company s investments generally mature within one year 
substantially all of the company s debt is at fixed interest rates  therefore  the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates 
the estimated fair market value of the company s debt approximated billion as of september  and billion as of august  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement the swap that effectively converted  beginning august   the fixed interest rate on the company s million convertible subordinated notes the notes to a variable interest rate based on the month london interbank offering rate libor less basis points 
the swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the notes attributable to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the functional currency for substantially all of the company s operations is the us dollar 
the company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currency valued at us million as of september   and us million as of august  including deferred income tax assets denominated in japanese yen valued at us million as of september   and us million as of august  
the company also held aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at us million as of september   and us million as of august  including debt denominated in japanese yen valued at us million as of september   and us million as of august  
foreign currency receivables and payables as of september   were comprised primarily of japanese yen  euros  singapore dollars and british pounds 
the company estimates that  based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollar as of september   a change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately million for the japanese yen and million for the euro
