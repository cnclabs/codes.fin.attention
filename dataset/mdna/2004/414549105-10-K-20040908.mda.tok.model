item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview harris interactive provides market research  polling and consulting services to a broad range of companies  non profit organizations and governmental agencies 
since  we have provided these services utilizing traditional market research and polling methodologies  such as direct mail  telephone based surveys  mall intercepts  focus groups and in person interviews 
in september  we began developing our internet panel and building the technology infrastructure to provide online market research and polling services 
in november  we introduced our first internet based market research and polling services and a majority of our revenues are now internet based 
we generally perform traditional and internet based custom research services on a fixed fee basis in response to client generated requests 
we sell our multi client research services on a periodic basis  typically annually 
harris interactive service bureau also performs research for other market research firms on a project by project basis in response to requests from those firms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the most significant of these areas involving difficult or complex judgments made by management with respect to the preparation of the company s financial statements in fiscal include revenue recognition  provision for uncollectible accounts  valuation of intangible assets and other long lived assets  valuation of goodwill  realizability of deferred tax assets  and hipoints loyalty program 
in each situation  management is required to make estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition revenue under fixed fee arrangements is principally recognized on a proportional performance basis using the cost to cost methodology  which the company believes is effectively equivalent to output measures 
this revenue includes amounts billed to our clients to cover subcontractor costs and other direct out of pocket expenses 
losses expected to be incurred  if any  on jobs in progress are charged to income as soon as such losses are known 
revisions to estimated costs and differences between actual contract losses and estimated contract losses would affect both the timing of revenue allocated and the results of operations of the company 
provision for uncollectible accounts the company maintains provisions for uncollectible accounts and estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to remit payments 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  thereby resulting in an inability to make payments  or if client disputes arise that delay or jeopardize payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of intangible assets and other long lived assets the company assesses the carrying value of its identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  significant under performance 
table of contents relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets or their physical condition  and significant adverse industry or market trends 
in the event that the carrying value of an asset is determined to be unrecoverable  the company would record an adjustment to the respective carrying value 
valuation of goodwill with respect to goodwill  the company completes an impairment test on an annual basis 
in performing this annual test  the company compares the fair value of its reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
in the event that a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  the company would record an adjustment to the respective reporting unit s goodwill for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value 
in addition to the annual impairment analysis  the company also assesses the carrying value of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
realizability of deferred tax assets the company has evaluated the valuation allowance and potential realization of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
in the determination of the valuation allowance  the company has considered future taxable income 
as a result of the company s operating performance in fiscal and the more favorable near term outlook for profitability  a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of with the resultant benefit to income and goodwill 
as a result of the continued profitable operating performance in fiscal and continued outlook for profitability  the remaining us valuation allowance was reversed in the fourth quarter of with the resultant benefit to income  goodwill and equity 
further financial information about income taxes is included in note  income taxes  to our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june  contained in this form k

hipoints loyalty program since july  the company has had a loyalty program hipoints  whereby points are awarded to market survey respondents who register for the company s online panel  complete online surveys and refer others to join our online panel 
the earned points  which are non transferable  may be redeemed for gifts from a specific product folio at any time prior to expiration  which is after one year of account inactivity 
the company maintains a reserve for its obligations with respect to future redemption of outstanding points  calculated based on the expected redemption rate of the points 
this expected redemption rate is estimated based on research from other loyalty and retention programs and the company s actual redemption rates to date 
an actual redemption rate that differs from this estimated redemption rate may have a material impact on the results of operations of the company

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated our results of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue years ended june  revenue from services cost of services gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative restructuring credits charges and asset write downs operating income loss interest and other income  net net income loss before taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from services 
total fiscal revenue increased to million from million in fiscal us revenue increased million to million for fiscal  an increase of over fiscal this increase in us revenue was attributable to growth in several markets  most predominantly strategic marketing and business consumer  health care and the harris interactive service bureau hisb 
revenue in the united kingdom also increased million to million from million  an increase of over fiscal this increased revenue for the united kingdom was a direct result of exchange rate differences that accounted for a million increase in revenue due to the depreciation of the us dollar 
on a constant currency basis  united kingdom revenue decreased million 
revenue in japan increased  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal of the increased japan revenue  million was as a result of exchange rate differences and the depreciation of the us dollar 
the remaining increase in japan revenue was due to steady growth of japan operations with the addition of new work coupled with the continued benefit from preexisting customers 
revenue for fiscal also includes million in revenue from novatris as a result of the march  acquisition 
thus  of the million of increased revenue in fiscal over fiscal  all but million represented organic growth 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of revenue  during fiscal  from million or of revenue for the prior year  primarily due to the growth in internet related business relative to overall revenue growth 
revenue from internet based services was million  or of total revenue  for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenue for fiscal during fiscal the company s european operations began to make significant strides in the movement towards internet based services which in turn helped increase gross margins 
european internet based revenues increased to million in fiscal  of total european revenue  from million in fiscal because of our continued efforts to build our european database  including the acquisition of novatris in march of as the company s internet based business model continued to mature and expand and the company saw increased conversion of existing work to the internet  lower margin traditional revenue decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal hisb  which is internet based  has also played a significant role in the growth of internet revenue 
hisb projects generate higher gross margins due to the fact that they are data collection only and typically do not include as much professional time as custom internet based research work 
for fiscal  hisb projects generated revenue for the company of million  up from million 
table of contents for the prior year 
in addition to the conversion of work to the internet  we have also made significant progress in reducing data processing and telephone data collection costs by outsourcing work to lower cost subcontractors  which in turn has improved our gross margins 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for fiscal compared with million  or of revenue  from the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased one percentage point 
the increase is attributable to the increased headcount for our sales force in both the united states and united kingdom 
the increased costs for sales and marketing during fiscal are in line with both the increased revenue as compared to fiscal and management s goals to grow our sales force during fiscal and into fiscal general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for fiscal  as compared to million or of revenue for the prior year 
increases in absolute dollars are largely due to increases in incentive compensation related expenses including salaries  fringe benefits and bonuses 
such expenses for fiscal increased approximately million compared to the prior year however remain in line with the costs necessary to support our increased volume of business 
the company s costs for database development also increased approximately million for fiscal compared to the prior year as the company continues to expand its database panel in the united states and western europe 
the increased database development costs however were offset by decreased telecommunication costs of approximately million because of the closing of call centers in the united states and united kingdom 
other increases in general and administrative expenses during fiscal include increased rent expense of million  approximately million from the addition of novatris in march  a bad debt write off in japan amounting to as well as other costs related to changes in our executive officers and the consolidation of operations in the united kingdom 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased three percentage points as the company has continued its cost saving efforts and stabilized operating expenses 
included within our cost saving efforts in fiscal was the decreased usage and eventual closing of our last telephone center in the united states in june of and the above mentioned consolidation of operations in the united kingdom 
because the company continues to maintain its major systems and assets established in prior years  overall capital expenditures continue to decline  and as a result depreciation expense has decreased million during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
interest income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million for both fiscal and fiscal throughout fiscal the company had more cash and marketable securities to invest  generated primarily from operations  however earnings on the increased investment balances were offset by lower interest rates 
net cash and marketable securities at june  was million compared to million at june  income taxes 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal as compared to a benefit of in fiscal the recorded benefit during fiscal and was the result of the reversal of valuation allowances on the company s deferred tax assets 
at the end of fiscal it was determined that it was more likely than not that we would utilize additional net operating losses in the near future  and therefore a portion of the valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal at the end of fiscal  after achieving two fiscal years of net income  it became even more likely that we will utilize all of our us net operating losses  and therefore the remaining us valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from services 
total fiscal revenue increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the overall increase in revenue was primarily driven by the million increase in us revenue  or  to million for fiscal the increased us revenue was partially attributable to the incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of total research as well as overall growth in several us markets  most prominently healthcare and customer loyalty management 
additionally  excluding the total research acquisition  the company recognized a modest increase in us revenue related to our expanding 
table of contents internet client base and internet based market research services  which contributed million in total us internet based revenue for fiscal  as compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
revenue for the united kingdom increased from the prior year by million  or  to million in fiscal revenue for japan increased million  or  to million in fiscal the increase in uk revenue was primarily attributable to the incremental revenue generated from the acquisition of total research in november revenue from japan increased due to the continued benefit we derived from new contracts with selected customers throughout fiscal approximately million of the increased revenue in fiscal was from true organic growth  excluding the impact of the company s acquisition of total research 
organic growth is calculated in accordance with the pro forma information provided in note  business combinations  to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this form k related to the company s acquisition of total research 
gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of revenue  for fiscal  compared with million  or of revenue  for fiscal the improvement in gross margin percentage resulted primarily from the growth in internet related business relative to overall revenue growth 
revenue from internet based services was million  or of total revenue  in fiscal  compared with million  or of revenue  for fiscal this increase in internet revenue was due in part to the acquisition of new internet based projects as well as the conversion of existing  traditional work to the internet 
additionally  through increasing the level of internet related work  the company has been able to use our existing panel for research in place of more expensive outsourcing and telephone costs 
hisb has also played a significant role in the growth of internet revenue 
hisb projects generate higher gross margins due to the fact that they are data collection only and typically do not include as much professional time as customer internet based research work 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were million  or of revenue  compared with million  or of revenue  for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased three percentage points 
the decrease is attributable to reductions in headcount and related expenses  reflecting the company s continuing efforts to reduce costs  as well as productivity improvements from the increased experience level of the company s sales force with harris interactive sales and marketing strategies 
the company has been able to maintain a consistent level of sales and marketing costs as a percentage of sales throughout the fiscal year despite increased fiscal fourth quarter expenditures for incentive compensation and severance related costs 
the severance related costs were associated with reorganizing our uk management team and the closing of one of our four uk offices 
the additional incentive compensation expense resulted from increased full year revenue results as compared to budget that led to increased commissions and bonuses to employees in accordance with the company s compensation plans 
in total annual expenditures in fiscal continue to support the company s overall business model established in the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue  in fiscal compared with million  or of revenue  for fiscal the ten percentage point decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue reflects reductions in headcount and related expenses  rent expense and depreciation expense  and reflects the company s continuing efforts to reduce costs 
depreciation and equipment rental and maintenance expenses decreased by a combined million  or  to million in fiscal primarily as a result of the fixed asset write offs in connection with the company s fiscal second quarter restructuring charge which reduced the level of gross fixed assets 
the restructuring plan also reduced fiscal rent expense by million as a result of the closing of three of our telephone centers 
as part of its cost savings efforts  the company has eliminated all but two telephone centers in the united states and the united kingdom  retaining one in each country primarily to support committed projects with longer term  predictable needs 
the balance of telephone data collection has been migrated to lower cost providers  including some in foreign countries 
the cost savings from the prior year restructuring plan were partially offset by increased database development costs related to the establishment of our western european panel as well as the continued expansion of our us panel 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income totaled million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to the lower average 
table of contents marketable securities balance that resulted from sales of the portfolio to fund operating losses  and to interest rates for fiscal compared to fiscal income tax benefit 
the company recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal as compared to a minimal expense in fiscal for financial reporting purposes  in fiscal the company was able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to apply against fiscal net income  resulting in substantially no current income tax expense 
as described above under fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes  the recorded benefit in was as a result of the partial reversal of the valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets 
due to operating losses in fiscal no benefit was recognized in that fiscal year 
significant factors affecting company performance internet and traditional revenue mix the primary factors driving the growth in the company s gross profit and net income loss are growth in revenue and the mix of the revenue derived from internet versus traditional work 
the company s model is based upon the premise that internet work is more profitable than traditional work  due to the comparatively low data collection cost of internet work  as illustrated by the following table 
the company believes that the table  which should be viewed as illustrative and not as an actual measure or predictor of any particular project or the company s projects as a whole at any given point in time  reasonably represents comparability of traditional and internet based projects prior to adjustment for the other factors affecting profitability described below 
traditional internet based revenue less cost of services as a of revenue direct payroll data collection gross profit as a of revenue in addition to the data collection costs and panel incentives  the internet based model has additional fixed costs associated with the development and maintenance of underlying databases and internet technology 
such costs decrease net income for internet based work 
in general  however  due to the interplay between the variable and fixed components of cost  the premise is that  as the volume and percentage of internet based work increases  and assuming that project professional service components and pricing are comparable and operating expenses continue to be managed in the ordinary course  net income as a percentage of revenue should also increase 
as our internet business grows and our model matures  we have continued to analyze the differential between internet and traditional work and have learned that the variables that affect the model are becoming commensurately more complex 
for example  projects that have a majority of data collection using the internet may still have a traditional data collection component  particularly in multi country studies involving countries for which internet databases are not fully developed 
the traditional data collection component will tend to decrease profitability 
profitability also is decreased by direct costs of outsourcing and pass through costs applicable to particular projects 
on the other hand  once fixed costs of database development and maintenance are absorbed  increases in volume and revenues have a progressively increasing impact on profitability 
pure internet data collection continues to have a lower variable data collection cost than traditional methods  and we continue to view the level of our internet revenues as an important indicator of revenue sources that would not be available to the company if it were not able to do internet work and as an important driver of our profitability 
we do not believe  however  that internet revenue in and of itself should be used as an unqualified measure or predictor for other purposes 

table of contents regarding the mix of work  for fiscal  the company s actual internet mix was on a global basis and in the united states alone 
internet and traditional revenue by geographic location for fiscal  and is as follows us europe japan market market market research research research total year ended june  internet revenue traditional revenue total revenue internet percentage of total year ended june  internet revenue traditional revenue total revenue internet percentage of total year ended june  internet revenue traditional revenue total revenue internet percentage of total the company considers all of the revenue from a project to be internet based whenever or more of the surveys were completed over the internet 
development of global database although the company continues to work to convert projects to the internet in the united states  the primary new growth opportunity is in europe  where the ability to change the internet mix is dependent upon the company s success in expanding the size of its respondent panel and increasing customer acceptance of internet based work 
the globalization of the internet portion of the company s business has commenced and we expect it to ramp up over the next several years 
the company s global database of more than million internet survey respondents continues to be a critical component of its success 
the company believes that its multi million participant us database continues to be adequate to service its us internet based business 
in fiscal  the company began to conduct more internet based projects in europe and continued its initiative to build a european database 
to that end  it entered into various name acquisition agreements that resulted in names being added regularly to the european database 
our initiative was helped significantly with the acquisition of novatris and its one million member european based panel in march as of june the company s european database included over million names 
the company intends to continue to expand the european panel in fiscal and beyond in order to support the growth of internet based research in europe 
additionally  in both the us and in europe  the company intends to continue efforts to enhance existing and build new specialty panels 
the amount of the company s investments in names for its databases will continue to vary  particularly quarter by quarter  based upon factors such as panel availability  opportunities that arise for acquisition or development of panels in specialty or under represented groups  client demand and attrition 
internet databases by their nature experience participant attrition 
there are no standard measurement systems for such attrition  particularly in the internet survey response field 
measurement involves complex variables 
for example  determining attrition  by lack of response from a panelist for a set length of time since last contact  is not necessarily reflective of expected long term attrition 
the panelist may not have had an interest in responding regarding particular survey topics offered over a period of time but may  after an absence  respond to a later survey covering a topic of particular interest to the respondent 
moreover  panelists who receive what they perceive to be excessively frequent survey requests tend to have higher than normal rates of attrition 
thus  percentage rates of attrition may not be comparable or meaningful within the industry 
when the company first 
table of contents developed its internet model  it expected attrition of panel members to be in the range of annually 
with the company s increased expertise gained from several years of investment in panel management techniques  it controls panel fatigue and monitors attrition in multiple ways 
its overall attrition rates by most measures  however  are significantly less than the company originally anticipated 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity prior to fiscal we financed our operations primarily through the million of net proceeds generated from our december initial public offering 
consequently  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million at june  in fiscal the company generated positive cash flows for the first time in recent years and as a result our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were million and million at june  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal the positive cash flows in fiscal and fiscal were primarily as a result of the company generating net income during each year as compared to the funding of net losses in fiscal the increased cash provided by operating activities in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the increased income before income taxes as the tax benefits reflected in net income during each period were essentially non cash items 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal during fiscal the company s investing activities included the net purchase of additional marketable securities of approximately million  cash paid in connection with the novatris acquisition of million and capital expenditures of million 
during fiscal the company s investing activities included the net purchase of additional marketable securities of approximately million as well as capital expenditures of million 
during fiscal  net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million were partially offset by capital expenditures of million and the million cash outflow for transaction related costs to acquire total research in november fiscal and capital expenditures primarily supported the development of our internet infrastructure in the us the trend of increased operating cash flows in fiscal and have resulted in decreased investing cash flows during each period as the company has elected to invest the additional idle cash in marketable securities that produce more favorable returns 
in fiscal and the company had net cash provided by financing activities of million and million  respectively 
cash flows from financing activities in fiscal were entirely due to issuances of common stock and stock option exercises 
the company received cash of million in fiscal as a result of issuances of common stock and stock option exercises  this was offset by the repayment of million in short and long term borrowings 
net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily related to the repayment of long term debt of million and the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million  these cash outflows were partially offset by million provided by the issuance of common stock and stock option exercises 
at june  and the company had no short term or long term borrowings 
capital resources at june   the company had cash and cash equivalents balances of million  a slight increase from at june  in addition to cash and cash equivalents  at june  the company also had million in marketable securities  an increase of from million at june  as stated above  the increase in marketable securities during fiscal is a direct result of the company electing to invest its idle cash in securities with the potential to produce more favorable returns 
a significant amount of the increased investment in marketable securities were invested in government securities which represented of the total balance  as opposed to commercial paper and corporate bonds which represented and of marketable securities balances at june   respectively 
at june   government securities  commercial paper and corporate bonds represented  and of the marketable securities balance  respectively 

table of contents at june   the company had  and continues to maintain  lines of credit with commercial banks providing borrowing availability up to million  at the prime interest rate 
the prime rate in effect at june  was 
borrowings under these arrangements are due upon demand 
there were no borrowings under these agreements at june  or these lines of credit are collateralized by the assets of the company 
the company maintains a letter of credit for million euro approximately million based on the june  euro conversion rate that serves as collateral for the contingent purchase price involved in the company s acquisition of novatris during the quarter ended march   which reduces our borrowing capacity against the million line of credit 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our services  the resources we allocate to the continuing development of our internet infrastructure and internet panel  marketing and selling of our services  our promotional activities  our acquisition activities and other factors 
management anticipates continuing expenditures for property  plant and equipment and working capital requirements throughout fiscal at levels consistent with fiscal regarding the company s ability to continue to generate revenue  the company must constantly develop new business  both for growth and to replace non renewed projects 
although work for no one client constitutes more than of the company s revenue  the company has had to  and in the future will likely have to  find significant amounts of replacement and additional revenue as customer relationships and work for continuing customers change 
the company s ability to generate revenue is dependent not only on execution of its business plan but also on general market factors outside of its control 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as a result  as economic conditions decline in any of our markets  our ability to generate revenue is adversely impacted 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements to support the company s planned operations for the foreseeable future 
we cannot be certain  however  that our underlying assumed levels of revenue and expenses will be accurate 
if our operating results were to fail to meet our expectations  or if accounts receivable or other assets or acquisitions were to require a greater use of cash than is currently anticipated  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financing or other arrangements 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
off balance sheet risk disclosure the company is not party to any off balance sheet arrangements

risk factors the market research industry is vulnerable to general economic conditions 
many of our clients treat all or a portion of their market research expenditures as discretionary 
as general economic conditions decline and our customers seek to control variable costs  projects to be performed by the 
table of contents company may be delayed or cancelled  and new project bookings may slow 
as a result  the growth and earnings of the company may be adversely impacted 
our growth will be adversely affected if the marketplace does not continue to convert to internet based market research and polling 
the ongoing success of our business will depend on our ability to continually develop and market internet based products and services that achieve broad market acceptance 
our clients must continue to accept the internet as an attractive replacement for traditional market research methodologies  such as direct mail  telephone based surveys  mall intercepts  focus groups and in person interviews 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have spent million and significant management resources to develop and grow our internet based market research and polling business 
some of our clients have expressed concern that internet users do not yet accurately reflect their applicable population  and that any information collected via the internet will be inherently biased 
if our current and potential clients do not continue to accept our internet based methodologies as reliable and unbiased  our revenues may not meet expectations or may decline  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
we face intense competitive pressures and uncertainties within the market research and polling industry 
the market research and polling industry is highly fragmented and includes competitors much larger than we are 
as competitors increase their ability to offer alternative products in the market  we may come under increasing pressures in selling and pricing our products and services 
no one customer accounts for more than of our revenues and most of our revenues are derived on a project by project basis 
we must continuously replace completed work with new projects in order to sustain and grow our revenues 
the market research industry tends to be adversely affected by slow or depressed business conditions in the market as a whole 
we are at risk of decreased market research budgets as our customers respond to difficult economic conditions  as well as to delays in projects both committed and uncommitted 
if we are unable to maintain adequate size and demographic composition of our existing internet panel  if we are unable to continue global growth  or if we are required to spend substantial funds to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our success is highly dependent on our ability to obtain and retain an adequate number of panelists in our internet panel and its specialty sub panels 
our ability to maintain an adequate online panel or increase internet revenues may be harmed if a significant number of our current online panelists decide that they are no longer willing to participate in our surveys  we lose a large number of online panelists from over use  and then must rely on a limited number of online panelists for ongoing research  we are unable to attract an adequate number of replacement panelists and specialty panel members  or new regulatory requirements related to internet spam make it impractical for us to continue operations as currently conducted 
there are no industry or other benchmarks for determining the optimal size and composition of an internet panel 
among other factors  panelist response rates differ with differing survey content and the frequency with which panelists are willing to respond to survey invitations is variable 
we believe that our current panel is adequate for the foreseeable future to accommodate our clients broad based survey requests  but circumstances could change due to factors described above and  additionally  we are not always able to accommodate client requests related to limited populations with particular demographic characteristics 
we constantly reassess our panel size and demographics as survey requests are made and  based upon availability of existing panelists to fulfill project requests  determine our need to recruit additional panelists over time 

table of contents in general  if the number of our active survey respondents significantly decreases  or the demographic composition of our internet panel narrows  our ability to provide our clients with accurate and statistically projectable information would likely suffer 
this risk is likely to increase as our business expands 
for example  our internet panel is surveyed for our own studies as well as for studies conducted for other market research firms by our harris interactive service bureau 
our business will be unable to grow and will suffer if we have an insufficient number of panelists to respond to our surveys  or if our panel becomes unreliable due to reduced size  or because it is not representative of the general population 
key components of our strategy are extension of our internet based market research and polling products and services to clients globally  expansion of our internet panel to include global online panelists and development of strategic alliances globally 
our inability to attract panel members in key regions  including particularly western europe and japan  would hinder our ability to serve the needs of our customers who do business on a global level 
although we have not developed reliable estimates of our needs in japan  we have estimated that our ability to effectively provide broad based internet research in western europe requires a panel with at least  respondents 
due in part to our acquisition of novatris  sa  our european panel now exceeds that size  but our future growth in europe may be constrained if we cannot increase the size of our european panel commensurate with that growth 
the optimal size of our panel in specific countries is subject to the same uncertainty as is applicable to our existing panel in the united states 
our online panelists are not obligated to participate in our surveys and polls and there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so 
we use our hi points  hi stakes and instant results programs to provide incentives to encourage participation in our surveys and to maintain the size of our internet panel 
if these programs lose their effectiveness in the future  a reduction in size or responsiveness of the panel could result 
if we are unable to overcome other risks associated with global operations  we will be unable to conduct business on a global level 
the following additional risks are inherent in doing business on a global level export controls relating to encryption technology  inability to comply with or enactment of more restrictive privacy laws  changes in regulatory requirements  currency exchange fluctuations  problems in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  potentially adverse tax consequences  political instability  internet access restrictions  and anti american sentiment or terrorist activity against american interests abroad 
we have little or no control over these risks 
we have encountered more restrictive privacy laws in connection with our business operations in europe  which have inhibited our ability to develop our european internet panel 
we have also experienced currency exchange fluctuations  the impact of which has not been material 
as we increase our global operations in the future  we may experience some or all of these risks  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not continue to keep pace with rapid technological change within the market research and polling industry  we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan 
the markets for our products and services are highly competitive 
our current competitors also offer internet based and traditional market research and polling services 
we expect to face future competition from 
table of contents other organizations that develop internet related products and services 
these companies may  either alone or in alliances with other firms  penetrate the internet based market research and polling market 
our ongoing success will depend on our continued ability to improve the performance features and reliability of our products and services 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes 
any failure in the performance of our internet based technology infrastructure could harm our business 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in our ability to communicate with our internet panel  collect research data  or protect visual materials included in our surveys  could result in reduced revenue  and could impair our reputation 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  earthquake  flooding  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
one supplier of our secure off site web hosting facilities currently maintains approximately one third of our servers at one facility  and the redundancy of our systems may not be adequate as we depend upon the supplier and others to protect our systems and operations from the events described above 
we have experienced technical difficulties and downtime of individual components of our computer system in the past and believe that technical difficulties and downtime may occur from time to time in the future 
the impact of technical difficulties and downtime may be severe 
we have developed  however have not fully implemented a formal disaster recovery plan and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures in our systems 
in addition  our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic 
any increase in demands on our servers beyond that which we currently anticipate  will require us to fund the expansion and modification of our network infrastructure 
if we were unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand  unanticipated system disruptions and slower data collection would likely result 
our internet panel members communicate with us using various internet service providers 
these providers have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties unrelated to our systems in the future 
major components of the internet backbone itself could fail due to terrorist attack  war or natural disaster 
our business is particularly vulnerable to such failure because not only would we suffer the effects experienced by businesses in general  we would be unable to perform internet surveys which are the core of much of our business 
we thus would be unable to effectively service the needs of many of our clients 
any future system delays or failures in the internet could adversely affect our access to our online panelists  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sustaining our growth may strain our managerial and systems resources 
we have grown rapidly and need to continue to grow in all areas of our operations 
managing and sustaining our growth will place significant demands on management as well as on our administrative  operational  technical and financial systems and controls 
ongoing consolidation within the market research industry will likely force us to grow in order to provide the geographic and functional range of services provided by larger competitors 
because we are in a service industry  inability to expand our employee resources will severely hamper our efforts 
moreover  because many of our larger competitors have global operations  our expansion must in part be global 
our operational and financial systems and controls will have to continue to adapt to a more diversified geographic base of operations 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan at projected levels 
we must continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled technical  managerial  marketing  sales and client support personnel 
competition for these personnel exists  and we may be unable to attract  integrate or retain the proper numbers of sufficiently qualified personnel 
table of contents that our business plan assumes 
in the past  we have from time to time experienced difficulty hiring and retaining qualified employees 
the internet research industry is new and there are few in any educational institutions that provide specialized training related to market research 
employees therefore must be recruited in competition with other industries and few of those who are recruited have direct or substantial experience with internet research 
in the past  competition for highly skilled employees has resulted in additional costs for recruitment  compensation and relocation or the provision of remote access to our facilities 
we may continue in the future to experience difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications 
to the extent that we are unable to hire and retain skilled employees in the future  our business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could disrupt our operations and result in loss of revenues 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key technical and senior management personnel  primarily including executive officers robert e 
knapp  our vice chairman and chief executive officer  gregory t 
novak  our president and chief operating officer  and leonard r 
bayer  our executive vice president and chief technical officer 
the loss of the services of any of these persons could seriously harm our business 
the loss of the services of the other executive officers named in item of this annual report on form k also could be disruptive to our business 
only a few of our employees are currently bound by an employment agreement 
all of our other relationships with our officers and key employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees other than gordon s 
black 
our business is largely dependent on the continued development and worldwide growth of the internet 
the internet may not grow  or may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth 
if worldwide internet usage does not continue to grow  we may be unable to attract international online panelists to our internet panel or clients for our internet based market research and polling products and services 
if internet usage does continue to grow  the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
varying factors could inhibit future growth or the ability of the internet infrastructure to adequately support the growth in internet usage  including inadequate network infrastructure  security concerns  inconsistent quality of service  and unavailability of cost effective  high speed service 
our internet panel depends on internet service providers  online service providers and other website operators for access to the internet and our websites 
many websites have experienced interruptions in their service as a result of outages and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if worldwide internet usage declines  or grows at a significantly slower rate than projected  our ability to maintain our current internet panel  expand our global internet panel and gather research data and information around the world will decrease  which would likely harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a breach of our internet security measures or security concerns could adversely affect our business 
internet security concerns could cause some online panelists to reduce their participation levels  provide inaccurate responses or end their membership in our internet panel 
this could harm our credibility with our current clients 
if our clients become dissatisfied  they may stop using our products and services 
in addition  dissatisfied and lost clients could damage our reputation 
a loss of online panelists or a loss of clients would hurt our efforts to generate increased revenues 

table of contents a failure in our security measures could result in the misappropriation of private data 
as a result  we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure or inability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business 
our success and ability to compete depends substantially on our internally developed technologies and trademarks  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
we have registered a number of our trademarks  including harris interactive and the harris poll 
if we were prevented from using the harris poll name  our brand recognition and business would likely suffer 
we would have to make substantial financial expenditures to promote and rebuild our brand identity 
currently  we have pending trademark applications for a number of our products and services 
we also have patent applications currently pending for our conceptloc encryption system and our system and method for conducting product configuration research over a computer based network 
in addition  we may apply for additional trademarks or patents in the future 
our patent or trademark applications may not be approved  or if approved  our patents or trademarks may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated 
we cannot guarantee that infringement or other claims will not be asserted or prosecuted against us in the future  whether resulting from our internally developed intellectual property or licenses or content from third parties 
any future assertions or prosecutions could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to pay money damages  introduce new trademarks  develop non infringing technology  or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
any of those events could substantially increase our operating expenses and potentially reduce our expected revenues 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with parties with whom we do business  and generally control access to  and distribution of  our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure  parties may attempt to disclose  obtain or use our technologies 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we also rely on off the shelf technologies that we license from third parties 
off the shelf technology refers to generally commercially available software that is not customized for a particular user 
these third party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the inability to use licensed technology important to our business could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at a greater cost 
in the future  we may seek to license additional technology to enhance our current technology infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that any such licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the loss of any of these technology licenses could result in delays in providing our products and services until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  licensed and integrated 
we may be subject to liability for publishing or distributing content over the internet 
we may be subject to claims relating to content that is published on or downloaded from our websites 
we also could be subject to liability for content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites 
for example  as part of surveys panelists sometimes access  through our websites or linkages to client websites  content provided by our clients such as advertising copy that may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies 
we also recruit panelists to participate in research sponsored and hosted by our clients on the client s website  and we cannot completely control breaches of privacy policies  warranties  or other claims that may be made by those third parties 
we may be accused of sending bulk unsolicited email  and have our email blocked by many isps and therefore be unable to conduct online data collection 
although we carry general liability insurance  our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type  such as defamation or trademark infringement  or may not be adequate to cover all costs incurred in defense of potential claims or to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
in addition  any claims of this type  with or without merit  would result in the diversion of our financial resources and management personnel 

table of contents liability arising from the use of the personal information of our internet panel could be costly 
we could be subject to liability claims by our online panelists for any misuse of personal information 
these claims could result in costly litigation 
in addition  the federal trade commission and other domestic and international agencies have been investigating various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
we could incur additional costs and expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if our privacy practices are investigated 
changes in government regulation or industry practices could limit our internet activities or result in additional costs of doing business on the internet 
any new laws pertaining to the imposition of taxes on internet access and electronic commerce could adversely affect our business 
in february  the federal communications commission issued a declaratory ruling interpreting the telecommunications act of to allow local exchange carriers to receive reciprocal compensation for traffic delivered to information service providers  particularly internet service providers  on the basis that traffic bound for internet service providers is largely interstate 
as a result of this ruling  the costs of transmitting data over the internet may increase and our business could suffer 
a significant majority of us state legislatures had enacted laws regulating the distribution of unsolicited email 
in december  the controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of can spam was enacted 
the law requires unsolicited e mail marketing messages to have a valid return address 
e mail marketers are required to remove customers from their mailing lists if requested 
the law also gives more legal ammunition for isps to take spammers to court  allows the federal trade commission ftc to impose fines  and gives state attorneys general the power to bring lawsuits 
any future legislation or regulations or the application of existing laws and regulations to the internet could limit our effectiveness in conducting internet based market research and polling  and increase our operating expenses 
in addition  the application of existing laws to the internet could expose us to substantial liability for which we might not be indemnified by content providers or other third parties 
existing laws and regulations currently address  and new laws and regulations and industry self regulatory initiatives are likely to address  a variety of issues  including the following email distribution  user privacy and expression  the rights and safety of children  intellectual property  information security  anti competitive practices  the convergence of traditional channels with internet commerce  taxation and pricing  and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
those laws that do reference the internet have limited interpretation by the courts and their applicability and scope are not well defined  particularly on an international basis 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect our business 
industry standards related to the internet are still evolving 
moreover  some private entities have proposed their own standards for communications with  and use of information related to  individuals who use the internet 
internet service providers also have the ability to disrupt our communications with our panel 
although we believe that we maintain the highest standards for the recruitment of members into our database  communications with our panelists and use of information provided by our respondents  some service providers and or self 
table of contents appointed industry regulators may not agree 
as a result  our communications with our panelists may be disrupted from time to time 
we have incurred losses in recent years and may incur them again 
we incurred net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we base current and future expense levels on our operating plans  which are based on our estimates of future revenues 
if our revenues grow at a slower rate than we anticipate  or if our spending levels exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted to reflect slower revenue growth  we may not be able to maintain profitability 
even if we remain profitable in the future  we may be unable to maintain current profitability growth on an ongoing basis 
variations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly operating results have in the past  and may in the future  fluctuate significantly 
our future results of operations may fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
factors that are outside of our control  and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future  include declines in general economic conditions or the budgets of our clients  a general decline in the demand for market research and polling products and services  seasonal decreases in demand for market research and polling services  development of equal or superior products and services by our competitors  technical difficulties that cause general and long term failure of the internet  and currency fluctuations 
factors that are partially within our control  and that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past or that may affect us in the future  include our relative mix of internet based and traditional market research and polling businesses  technical difficulties associated with the investments in and maintenance of our own systems that negatively affect our operations  our ability to maintain the proper size and scope of our internet panel necessary to develop and sell new products and services and generate expected revenues  our ability to recruit respondents into our sub panels  such as our it decision makers  to conduct high value research for our clients  and development of our own new  marketable products and services 
the factors listed above may affect both our quarter to quarter operating results as well as our long term success 
you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations or any other trend in our performance as an indication of our future results 
the price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of internet related companies have been especially volatile and these securities may be overvalued 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations 
if financial operating results do not improve or improve at a slower rate than we anticipate  or if operating or capital expenditures exceed our expectations and cannot be adjusted accordingly  or if some other event adversely affects us  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
in addition  if the market for internet related stocks or the stock market in general experiences an additional loss in investor confidence or declines 
table of contents again  the market price of our common stock could fall for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
investors might be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the purchase price 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the subjects of securities class action litigation 
if we were to become the subject of securities class action litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our charter could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company 
our restated certificate of incorporation provides for the division of our board of directors into three classes  eliminates the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting  and provides our board of directors with the power to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
the preferred stock could have voting  dividend  liquidation  and other rights established by the board of directors that are superior to those of our common stock 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law contains provisions that impose restrictions on stockholder action to acquire our company 
the effect of these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could discourage or prevent third parties from seeking to obtain control of us  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might receive a premium for their shares over prevailing market prices 
potential acquisitions of  or investments in  other companies may not be available and or have a negative impact on our business 
as part of our continued strategy to increase revenue  expand our internet panel  acquire additional intellectual capital and add to our portfolio of existing products and services  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  services  products or technologies 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire them at reasonable prices and or on reasonable terms 
some material risks of acquisitions are difficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired business  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the availability of favorable acquisition financing  and the potential loss of key employees and or customers of any acquired business 
acquisitions may require the use of significant amounts of cash  resulting in the inability to use those funds for other business purposes 
acquisitions using our capital stock could have a dilutive effect  and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
amortization of intangible assets would reduce our earnings  which in turn could negatively influence the price of our common stock 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of operating in foreign markets  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions 
the company has international sales and operations in the united kingdom  japan and france 
therefore we are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
non us sales are denominated in the functional currencies of the country in which our foreign subsidiaries reside 
total consolidated assets and liabilities of the company are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for each period presented 
accumulated net translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity 
the company measures our risk to foreign currency rate exposure on two levels  the first being the impact on operating results on the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in the functional currency of their home country  and the second being the extent to which we have instruments denominated in a foreign currency 

table of contents foreign exchange translation gains and losses are included in the company s results of operations as a result of consolidating the results of operations of our united kingdom  french and japanese subsidiaries  which are denominated in british pounds  euros and japanese yen  respectively  with our us results 
the impact of translation gains or losses on net income from consolidating foreign subsidiaries were not material for the periods presented 
we have historically had very low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates upon consolidating our foreign subsidiaries due to the size of our foreign operations in comparison to our us operations 
while the united kingdom now contributes significantly to our revenues  we continue to believe our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation risk is low given that our united kingdom operations have historically produced low operating margins 
however  as the operating margins in the united kingdom increase and we continue to expand in europe  our exposure to the appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar could have a more significant impact on our net income and cash flows 
to the extent the company incurs expenses that are based on locally denominated sales volumes paid in local currency  the exposure to foreign exchange risk is reduced 
since the company s foreign operations are conducted using a foreign currency we bear additional risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
we have historically had low exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with regard to instruments denominated in a foreign currency given the amount and short term maturity of these instruments 
the carrying values of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency  including cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
the company has determined that the impact of a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
therefore the company has not entered into any derivative financial instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk 
however  this does not preclude the company s adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
as we continue to expand globally  the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may increase 
therefore  in the future  we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis to mitigate such risks
