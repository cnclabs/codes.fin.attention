overview mpw is a leading provider of integrated  technically based industrial cleaning and related facilities support services to a broad array of industries in north america on a daily recurring basis  a project by project basis  as well as pursuant to longer term arrangements 
the company has over branch locations in states and canada and operates under three separate segments industrial cleaning and facility maintenance  industrial container cleaning and industrial process water purification and chemical cleaning 
the results of our operations are mainly driven by two factors  customer demand and pricing 
many of our significant customers operate in industries  such as the automotive  steel  manufacturing  pulp and paper and utility industries  which are subject to work stoppages and slowdowns and have historically shown sensitivity to recessions and other adverse conditions in the general economy 
during fiscal  the company saw many of its customers defer  reduce or internalize maintenance programs in order to control costs 
in addition  the industrial services industry is highly competitive and fragmented  resulting in continuous pressure to reduce prices 
in some cases  this pressure has caused us to either reduce pricing or lose business 

table of contents our focus over the past year and going forward is to minimize the peaks and valleys associated with the variability in customer demand by increasing our cross marketing efforts to offer our diversified services to all existing and new customers  seeking additional long term contractual arrangements and creating new service lines to complement our current offerings 
results of operations the following table sets forth revenue and income from operations by segment for continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june   and expenses associated with the company s corporate headquarters are fully allocated to the segments

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of the company s significant judgments and uncertainties that could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the following accounting policies are considered the most critical to the company  in that they are the primary areas subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the company 
revenue and cost recognition 
the company primarily derives its revenues from services under time and materials  fixed price and unit price contracts 
revenues from these contracts are recorded based on performance and efforts expended 
revenues derived from non contract activities are recorded as services are performed or goods are sold 
cost of services include all direct labor  material  travel  subcontract and other direct and indirect project costs related to contract performance 
cost of services also includes all costs associated with operating equipment  including depreciation 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to the company s accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level that the company considers appropriate based on historical experience and other factors that affect collectibility 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company records reserves for bad debts based on the age of the receivables and historical bad debt percentages 
while the company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate  changes in major customers ability to meet financial obligations or higher than expected defaults could cause the company to lower its estimates of recoverability by a material amount 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is recorded at cost and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful lives of the asset 
maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful life of the respective assets are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the straight line method 
depreciation on the company s property and equipment has been computed based on the following useful lives years buildings and improvements to motor vehicles and transportation equipment to machinery and equipment to furniture  fixtures and computer equipment to goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment upon adoption of the standard and annually thereafter or upon the occurrence of certain triggering events as defined by sfas no 
sfas no 
requires a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step identifies indications of impairment  while the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and if future undiscounted cash flows are believed insufficient to recover the remaining carrying value of the asset  the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period the impairment is identified 
insurance risk 
the company is self insured for workers compensation  general and auto liability costs up to certain retention levels and purchases private insurance for claims in excess of those retention levels 
the company records its self insurance liability based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
these liabilities are based on estimates and  while management believes that the reserve is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
contractual obligations as of june   the company had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years notes payable to bank other notes payable non cancelable operating leases total contractual cash obligations during fiscal  the company entered into a non cancelable operating lease with a third party to lease an aircraft 
the lease was for a one year term with two additional one year renewal options 
the company has exercised the first and second renewal options 
the aircraft may be purchased or returned at the end of the lease with a maximum obligation of  during fiscal  the company determined that it is a guarantor of a lease agreement related to a facility operated by its former subsidiary  pentagon 
the lease  on which rent is approximately  per month  expires in october as of june   the company believes its maximum potential liability is million  payable only if pentagon fails to comply with the lease terms  and subject to many factors  including the landlord s duty to mitigate  the validity of the guarantee and the like 
related party transactions the company rents certain land  property  buildings and an aircraft from entities controlled by its principal shareholder and chief executive officer ceo under long term lease agreements 
the company also periodically uses a ranch  which is owned by an entity controlled by the ceo  for entertainment and overnight lodging of customers and other business associates 
total expenses related to these leases and to the ranch were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
these transactions are reviewed periodically by the company s audit committee 
based on such review  the company believes that these transactions are on terms at least as favorable as those that could be obtained from an independent third party 
the company provides  from time to time  certain fabrication type services to pro kleen industrial services  inc pro kleen  a portable sanitation services company wholly owned by the company s principal shareholder and ceo 
the company charges pro kleen for the cost of services it renders plus a markup 
the amount of such charges for fiscal years  and were approximately   and  respectively 
these charges are for the use of parts and supplies and the use of certain of the company s employees on certain projects as requested by pro kleen 
these charges are generally treated as an offset to supplies  repairs and maintenance or labor expense 
during fiscal  the company also sold existing equipment to pro kleen for cash proceeds of  the sale was reviewed and approved by the company s audit committee 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in fiscal  the company generated million in cash from operating activities  representing a million decrease from fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of an increase in working capital combined with lower income from operations 
working capital of million at june  increased million from june  the increase was due to a million decrease in accounts receivable offset by a million decrease in accounts payable caused by a large one time project that occurred in late fiscal the company s primary investing and financing activities during fiscal included spending million on capital projects and paying million on long term debt 
these transactions were funded by the cash flows from the company s operations 
capital spending during fiscal included the purchase of land and a building in fairborn  ohio  purchases of new vehicles and equipment and spending to rebuild existing equipment in primarily the industrial cleaning and facility maintenance and industrial water process purification and chemical cleaning segments 
for the fiscal year ending june   we expect to spend approximately million on capital projects 
the company s short term and long term liquidity needs are primarily served by a credit agreement with its principal banks the credit facility 
the credit facility provides the company with million of revolving credit availability for a three year period and a million three year term loan to be repaid in quarterly installments of million

the company also pays a commitment fee of for unused portions of the credit facility 
the interest rate is subject to change based on interest rate formulas tied to the ratio of consolidated funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization

as of june   outstanding borrowings under the credit facility were million 
the company has two pay fixed interest rate swap agreements as a hedge against the interest rate risk associated with borrowing at a variable rate  which mature in june the objective of the hedge is to eliminate the variability of cash flows related to interest rate payments on the company s variable rate debt 
as of june   the swap agreements have a notional amount of million and million and effectively lock in a portion of the company s variable rate revolving credit liability at fixed rates of and  respectively  plus the company s applicable margin 
these swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges  as defined under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
the company adjusts the pay fixed interest rate swaps to current market values through other comprehensive income loss 
the company anticipates that these contracts will continue to be effective 
the gain loss deferred in accumulated comprehensive income loss will be recognized immediately in earnings if the contracts are no longer effective or the forecasted transactions are not expected to occur 
the company expects to continue to assess acquisition opportunities as they arise 
additional financing may be required if the company makes an acquisition 
there can be no assurance  however  that any such opportunities will arise  that any such acquisitions will be consummated  or that any needed additional financing 
table of contents will be available on satisfactory terms when required 
absent any other acquisitions  we anticipate that cash flows from operations and unused borrowing capacity should be sufficient to fund expected normal operating costs  working capital  and capital expenditures for the company s existing businesses 
recently adopted accounting standards effective july   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities
