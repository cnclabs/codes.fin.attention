table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview was a year of important achievement for emak in we entered into long term agreements which provide that we will retain our role as the primary creative and manufacturing agency of record for burger king s worldwide premium programs 
for the first time in our year relationship we have a significant level of guaranteed premium manufacturing business under our agreements with burger king and restaurant services  inc rsi 
rsi is a not for profit purchasing cooperative that has as its members burger king franchisees and burger king and is the exclusive purchasing agent for the burger king system of franchisee owned and company owned restaurants in the united states 
our agreements with burger king and rsi guarantee that we will retain our role as the primary creative and manufacturing agency of record for both domestic and international burger king premiums programs awarded through september shipping through approximately september 
these evergreen agreements also provide for bi annual determinations of our guaranteed level of burger king premiums business 
our logistix kids subsidiary  which is based in the united kingdom  had another good year  growing its marketing services business substantially over since we acquired logistix in mid  they have delivered annual growth in revenues beyond our expectations 
we re continuing to expand the presence of logistix kids in both europe and the united states 
our consumer products business had a good year  with the introduction of disney s kim possible and an expanded line of crayola retail bath products 
was this division s most profitable year ever as gross margins improved from in to in our consumer products business is also poised for growth in as several of the licensed properties we acquired in reach their first full year of distribution 
these properties include disney s kim possible which enters wider channels of distribution in  disney s baby einstein and warner bros 
s samurai jack  among others 
we broadened our client base to a new channel of distribution with the acquisition of the business sci promotion group sci in september sci has established itself as a premier marketing services company to the retail department store industry  and counts nine of the top ten department stores in the country as its customers  including kohl s  macy s may department stores  nordstrom and sears 
sci complements our existing capabilities 
we have the most diversified revenue mix since emak s initial public offering in the contributions from our non burger king business increased from approximately  or of revenues in to approximately  or of revenues in we expect to make further progress on our diversification in we also faced challenges in that have negatively impacted our results we experienced lower unit volumes in our promotional programs for burger king 
this negatively impacted our marketing services revenues for the year 
we expect this trend to continue in before reversing in as this well regarded brand begins its next era of growth 
we also experienced a significant decline in our scooby doo consumer products 
in  the successful feature film drove higher levels of sales 
we expect scooby doo sales to recover in as the feature film sequel was released on march and the video is expected to be released later in the year 
our upshot integrated marketing business  while profitable  did not contribute the level of growth we expected 
in  we incurred a restructuring charge in order to bring upshot s cost structure in line with the current volume of business 
we have put in place plans to improve this business in we expect improved contribution from upshot based on a lower cost structure as well as future growth in revenues 
at the end of our financial position remained strong with  in cash and cash equivalents and no debt 
we plan to continue to explore additional acquisition candidates that fit our acquisition strategy 
in february  we acquired the premiums business of johnson grossfield  inc jgi  thereby expanding our client base in the quick service restaurant category with the addition of the kids marketing programs of subway restaurants 
jgi has a twelve year relationship with subway restaurants providing custom licensed premiums for its kids marketing program 
we are attracted to businesses like sci and jgi that can leverage our current infrastructure while contributing new clients  complementary service offerings  and a strong presence in new channels of distribution or geographies

these decreased unit volumes are primarily related to overall business issues at burger king which is in a restructuring phase following its acquisition by texas pacific group in the decreased volume levels in the burger king business were partially offset by continued growth at our logistix kids subsidiary

in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of business enterprises variable interest entities to which the usual condition ownership of a majority voting interest of consolidation does not apply 
the interpretation focuses on financial interests that indicate control 
it concludes that in the absence of clear control through voting interests  a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and potential rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
variable interests are rights and obligations that convey economic gains or losses from changes in the values of the variable interest entity s assets and liabilities 
variable interests may arise from financial instruments  service contracts  nonvoting ownership interests and other arrangements 
if an enterprise holds a majority of the variable interests of an entity  it would be considered the primary beneficiary

critical accounting policies we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies described below are those we consider most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of each of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed each of the disclosures included below 
these policies include significant judgment made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
as described below  however  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
revenue recognition for product related sales  we record revenues when title and risk of loss pass to the customer

the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns represent adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed partially or entirely uncollectible 
management believes the accounting estimate related to such allowances is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in it could materially affect key financial measures including revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the allowances require a high degree of judgment since they involve the estimation of the impact of both current and future economic factors as it relates to each of its customers ability to pay amounts owed to us 
in the case of its consumer products segment  we must estimate the impact of retail sell through on customer discounts and returns 
we regularly extend credit to distribution companies in connection with our business with burger king  which more recently includes the newly formed supply chain services  llc scs  which is a subsidiary of burger king s franchisee purchasing cooperative rsi 
we began selling product to scs in october  we anticipate that sales to scs will reach of our sales to the burger king system by the end of receivables from scs are being guaranteed by rsi as required under our credit policy 
because of rsi s established credit history with us  we don t believe that this increase in concentration of receivables has negatively impacted our overall credit risk 
failure by scs or one or more distribution companies to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the largest such distribution company accounted for  and of the products purchased from us by the burger king system for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the largest such distribution company accounted for and of accounts receivable as of december  and  respectively 
we also extend credit to several retailers in the consumer products business 
the mass market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years  causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems 
failure by one or more of these retailers to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have procedures to mitigate the risk of exposure to losses from bad debts 
revenue is recognized provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists documenting the specific terms of the transaction  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our credit limits and payment terms are established based on the underlying criteria that collectibility must be reasonably assured at the levels set for each customer 
extensive evaluations are performed on an on going basis throughout the fiscal year of the financial performance  cash generation  financing availability and liquidity status of each customer 
each customer is reviewed at least annually  with more frequent reviews being performed if necessary based on the customer s financial condition and the level of credit being extended 
for customers who are experiencing financial difficulties  management performs additional financial analyses prior to shipping to those customers on credit 
customer terms and credit limits are reviewed and adjusted  if necessary  to reflect the results of the review 
we use a variety of financial transactions to ensure collectibility of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk  including requiring letters of credit and requiring cash on delivery 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns at the time revenue is recognized based on management s assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical collection experience  accounts receivable aging  retail sell through and customer disputes 
when a significant event occurs  such as a bankruptcy filing of a customer  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and adjusted to reflect the change in estimated receivable impairment 
we believe that our allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns at december  are adequate and proper 
goodwill and other intangibles sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets were approved by fasb effective june  for business combinations consummated after june  sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interests method for business combinations and requires use of the purchase method 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for goodwill and certain other intangible assets from an amortization approach to a non amortization impairment approach 
the statement requires amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with previous business combinations to cease upon adoption of the statement by calendar year companies on january  the statement required us to perform a transitional goodwill impairment test  using values as of the beginning of the fiscal year that sfas no 
is adopted 
we completed the goodwill transitional impairment test in the second quarter of as a result  we determined that a non cash charge in the amount of  net of tax  is required in connection with the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of contract marketing  inc and 
table of contents us import and promotions co  collectively referred to as usi 
the transition charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principles effective january   and therefore  results for the quarter ended march  have been adjusted retroactively 
we have adopted the provisions of these statements for the acquisition of logistix effective july  and for all other acquisitions effective january  accordingly  beginning on january   we have foregone all related goodwill amortization expense 
prior to implementing sfas no 
 we reviewed all goodwill assets for impairment under the methodology of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for the long lived assets to be disposed of 
the undiscounted cash flows associated with all goodwill assets were in excess of the book value of the related goodwill assets  including usi goodwill 
therefore  no goodwill assets  including usi goodwill  were considered impaired under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 the carrying value of assets acquired  including goodwill  are reviewed annually 
during such a review we will estimate the fair value of the reporting unit to which the assets were assigned by discounting the reporting unit s estimated future cash flows before interest 
we will compare the discounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the acquired net assets to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair values 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
and determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of december  management believes the accounting estimate related to the valuation of its goodwill and other intangibles is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in assumptions could materially affect key financial measures  including net income and goodwill 
our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue  operating expenses and working capital investment for the reporting unit over a multi year period 
additionally  management must make an estimate of its weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
changes in these projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step in the sfas no 
impairment model  which could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded 
royalties we enter into agreements to license intellectual properties such as trademarks  copyrights  and patents 
the agreements may call for minimum amounts of royalties to be paid in advance and throughout the term of the agreement  which are non refundable in the event that product sales fail to meet certain minimum levels 
advance royalties resulting from such transactions are stated at the lower of the amounts paid or the amounts estimated to be recoverable from future sales of the related products 
furthermore  minimum guaranteed royalty commitments are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that amounts are recoverable based on estimates of future sales of the products under license 
a loss provision will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations to the extent that future minimum royalty guarantee commitments are not recoverable 
estimated future sales are projected based on historical experience  including that of similar products  and anticipated advertising and marketing support by the licensor 
management believes the accounting estimate related to minimum guaranteed royalty commitments is a critical accounting estimate because changes in sales projections could materially affect key financial measures including  gross profit  net income and other assets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
management believes the accounting estimate related to inventory allowance is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it could materially affect key financial measures including  gross profit  net income and inventories 
in addition  the valuation requires a high degree of judgment since it involves estimation of the impact resulting from both current and expected future events 
as more fully described below  valuation of our consumer product inventory could be impacted by changes in public and consumer preferences  demand for product  or changes in the buying patterns and inventory management of customers 
although the significant majority of our inventories are composed of made to order promotional product  in the consumer product segment orders are subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment since actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines  strength of competing products  marketing strategies of retailers and overall economic conditions 
unexpected changes in these factors could result in excess inventory in a particular product line  which would require management to make a valuation estimate on such inventory 
we base our production schedules for consumer products on customer orders  historical trends  results of market research and current market information 
we ship products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by our customers  which usually request delivery within three months 
in anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season in the fourth quarter  we significantly increased our production in advance of the peak selling period  resulting in a corresponding build up of consumer product inventory levels in the second and third quarters of the year 
these seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times cause risk to our consumer 
table of contents product business associated with the underproduction of popular products and the overproduction of products that do not have significant consumer demand 
retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly  requiring us to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers 
these factors increase inventory valuation risk since we may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times  or that our own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre build products before orders are placed 
additionally  current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of growth in various parts of the economy  including the markets in which we participate 
economic changes may affect the sales of our consumer products and its corresponding inventory levels  which would potentially impact the valuation of our inventory 
at the end of each quarter  management within the consumer products business segment performs a detailed review of its inventory on an item by item basis and identifies which products are believed to be obsolete or slow moving 
management then applies an allowance for inventory obsolescence to such inventory based on certain expectations  including customer and consumer demand for product and the aging of the inventory  which are impacted by the factors discussed above 
management believes that the allowance for obsolescence at december  is adequate and proper 
however  the impact resulting from the aforementioned factors could cause actual results to vary 
any incremental obsolescence charges would negatively affect the results of operations of the consumer products business segments 
cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this form k and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are important risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations  business and financial condition to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this form k 
we depend significantly on one key customer our success is partly dependent on a single customer  burger king  which accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the termination or a significant reduction by burger king of its business with us would adversely affect our business 
we have domestic and international agreements with burger king and its franchisee purchasing cooperative which guarantee that we will retain our role as the primary creative and manufacturing agency of record for both domestic and international burger king premiums programs awarded through september shipping through approximately september 
our long term agreements provide for bi annual determinations of our guaranteed level of burger king premiums business 
the burger king business is subject to significant year to year variability 
for instance  our revenues generated by our business with burger king increased from  in to  in then dropped to  in we expect a further reduction in sales to burger king of  to  in before increasing in the success of our business with burger king is also partially dependent on the overall success of the burger king system  whose sales could be negatively impacted by such factors as increased competition  a recent change in ownership and product recalls 
we face credit risk we regularly extend credit to distribution companies in connection with our business with burger king  which more recently includes the newly formed scs  which is a subsidiary of burger king s franchisee purchasing cooperative rsi 
we began selling product to scs in october  we anticipate that sales to scs will reach of our sales to the burger king system by the end of failure by scs to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
receivables from scs are being guaranteed by rsi as required under our credit policy 
because of rsi s established credit history with us  we don t believe that this increase in concentration of receivables has negatively impacted our overall credit risk 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain guarantees from rsi in the future 
we also extend credit to several retailers in connection with our consumer products business 
the mass market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years  causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems 
failure by one or more of these retailers to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on the continued development of new promotional programs a large portion of our revenues come from a relatively limited number of promotional programs  which promotions are in effect for only a limited period of time and generally are not repeated 
we must continually develop and sell new products and services for utilization in new promotional programs as part of our clients annual promotions calendars 
there can be no assurance that we or our customers will be able to secure licenses for additional entertainment properties on which to base our promotional products or that  if secured  such licenses will result in successful products 

table of contents we rely on the continued development of new consumer products many consumer products are successfully marketed for only one or two years as a result of changing consumer preferences 
accordingly  our consumer products business depends on the ability to develop and market new products associated with new entertainment properties or proprietary concepts 
there can be no assurance that any new retail product line will be successful 
the cancellation or premature termination of one or more retail product lines because of our inability to renew or extend licenses which typically have terms of three years or less on favorable terms or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure licenses for additional entertainment properties on which to base our consumer products or that  if secured  such licenses will result in successful products 
the success of our products depends on the popularity of licensed materials our promotional premiums and consumer products are typically based on entertainment properties  such as characters from current motion pictures or television programs 
the success of these products largely depends on the popularity of the entertainment properties on which they are based 
each motion picture and television program is an individual artistic work  and its commercial success is dependent on unpredictable consumer preferences 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if the entertainment properties upon which our products are based turn out to be less popular than we anticipate 
also  delays in the release of motion pictures or television programs could result in delays or cancellations of our promotions 
our future operating results are difficult to predict we experience significant quarter to quarter variability in our revenues and net income 
the promotions business tends to include larger promotions in the summer and during the winter holiday season 
major movie and television release schedules also vary year to year  influencing the promotional schedules of our customers  as well as the particular promotions for which we are retained 
the motion picture or television characters on which the promotions business is often based may only be popular for short periods of time or not at all 
there may not be comparable popular characters or similar promotional campaigns in the future 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarter our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
there are risks associated with acquisitions if we are presented with appropriate opportunities  we intend to make investments in complementary companies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions or investment 
if we buy a company  we could have difficulty in assimilating that company s personnel and operations 
in addition  the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
if we make other types of acquisitions  we could have difficulty in assimilating the acquired technology or products into our operations 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities and or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our business may be impacted by adverse general economic conditions current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the economy as a whole 
it is even more difficult to estimate growth in various parts of the economy  including the markets in which we participate 
because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth in the markets we serve and demand for our products and services  the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures even more difficult than usual to make 
adverse changes may occur as a result of softening global economies  wavering consumer confidence caused by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks such as those in the us on september   war  or other factors affecting economic conditions generally 
such changes may negatively affect the sales of our products  increase exposure to losses for bad debt  or increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing these products 
our current licenses require us to pay minimum royalties sales of products under trademarks or trade or brand names licensed from others account for substantially all of our consumer products revenues 
product licenses allow us to capitalize on characters  designs  concepts and inventions owned by others or developed by toy inventors and designers 
our license agreements generally require us to make specified minimum royalty payments  even if we fail to sell a sufficient number of units to cover these amounts 
our business is subject to extensive government regulation and to potential product liability claims our business is subject to the provisions of  among other laws  the federal consumer products safety act and the federal hazardous substances act  and rules and regulations promulgated under these acts 
these statutes are administered by the consumer product safety commission cpsc which has the authority to remove from the market products that are found to be defective and present a substantial hazard or risk of serious injury or death 
the cpsc can require a manufacturer to recall  repair  or replace these products under certain circumstances 
we cannot assure that defects in our products will not be alleged or found 
products that we develop or sell may expose us to liability from claims by users of such products for damages including  but not limited to  bodily injury or property damage 
we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in amounts that we believe are adequate 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such coverage or obtain additional coverage on acceptable terms in the future  or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against all potential claims 
products that we develop or sell may also expose us to liability for the costs related to product recalls 
these costs can include legal expenses  advertising  collection and destruction of product  and free goods 
our product liability insurance coverage generally excludes such costs and damages resulting from product recall 
our markets are highly competitive the markets in which our businesses operate are highly competitive 
our competitors  and in many cases their parent companies  include companies which have far more extensive sales and development staffs and significantly greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against such companies 
we rely on foreign manufacturers during  approximately of our products were manufactured in china 
foreign manufacturing is subject to a number of risks  including transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic disruptions  the imposition of tariffs  quotas and other import or export controls  and changes in governmental policies 
in addition  past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome have been significantly concentrated in asia  particularly in hong kong and in the guangdong province of china  where many of our contract manufacturers are located 
the development and manufacture of our products could suffer if a significant number of our employees in hong kong or the employees of our contract manufacturers in china contract sars or other communicable diseases  or are otherwise unable to fulfill their responsibilities 
we do not have long term contracts with our foreign manufacturers 
although we believe we could secure other third party manufacturers to produce our products  our operations could be adversely affected if we lost our relationship with several of our current foreign manufacturers 
virtually all of the raw materials used in our products are available to our contract manufacturers from numerous suppliers 
our manufacturers do not have long term supply contracts in place with their raw materials suppliers 
accordingly  we are subject to variations in the prices we pay to our manufacturers for products  depending on what they pay for their raw materials 
an increase in the cost of raw materials  such as petroleum  could result in price increases which we may not be able to fully pass on to our customers 
any such increase could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we face foreign currency risk as part of our business  we enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of products with entities in foreign countries 
while the vast majority of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  significant fluctuations in the local currencies of the entities with which we transact business may adversely affect these entities abilities to fulfill their obligations under their contracts 
logistix kids enters into contracts denominated primarily in us dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
although we attempt to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of certain hedging techniques  changes in such exchange rates may result in changes in the value of our commitments and anticipated foreign currency cash flows
