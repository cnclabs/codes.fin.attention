item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements in the following discussion may be forward looking and involve risk and uncertainty 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes hereto 
overview we are an independent exploration and production company that applies d seismic imaging and other advanced technologies to systematically explore for and develop onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the united states 
our activities are concentrated in the onshore texas gulf coast  the anadarko basin and west texas  which are areas with known hydrocarbon resources  which are conducive to multi well  repeatable drilling programs and the skills of our technical staff 
our principal business is the generation of drilling prospects in our core provinces  the drilling of those prospects and  if successful  the subsequent completion and production of the resulting oil or natural gas well 
we do not have a history of aggressively competing for acquisition opportunities  although we regularly review such opportunities 
we believe that we can achieve a better and more predictable rate of return by focusing our activities on prospect generation  drilling and producing activities 
to support our prospect generation activities  we allocate a portion of our capital expenditures to land  geophysical and geological activities 
over the past three years capital expenditures for land  geophysical and geological activities represented of our total capital expenditures 
for  we expect to spend approximately of our total capital expenditures on land  geophysical and geological activities 
the capital that funds our drilling activities is allocated to individual prospects based on the value potential of a prospect  as measured by a risked net present value analysis 
we start each year with a budget and reevaluate this budget monthly 
the primary factors that impact this value creation measure include forecasted commodity prices  drilling and completion costs  and a prospect s risked reserve size and risked initial producing rate 
other factors that are also monitored throughout the year that influence the amount and timing of our drilling expenditures include the level of production from our existing oil and natural gas properties  the availability of drilling and completion services  and the success and resulting production of our newly drilled wells 
the outcome of our monthly analysis results in a reprioritization of our exploration and development well drilling schedule to ensure that we are optimizing our capital expenditure plan 
over the past three years  we have spent approximately million to drill exploratory wells  which represents of our total capital expenditures for that time period 
for  we currently plan to spend approximately million  or of our total budgeted capital expenditures to drill exploratory wells 
we believe that we possess a multi year inventory of exploratory drilling prospects  the majority of which have been internally generated by our staff 
as a consequence and considering the results that we have achieved in recent years  we expect that we will continue to emphasize our prospect generation and drilling strategy as our primary means of creating value for our shareholders 
over the past three years we have spent approximately million to drill development wells  which represents of our total capital expenditures for that time period 
due to our exploratory drilling success  over the last four years  a growing percentage of our capital expenditures have been allocated to the development of our six significant field discoveries 
we expect this trend to continue  and for currently plan to spend approximately million  or of our total budgeted capital expenditures to drill development wells 
highlights during  we achieved several financial and operational milestones 
the following are some of the highlights for our average daily production for was mmcfe d and increased over average daily production in we added approximately bcfe of proved reserves  of which bcfe were proved developed  growing our estimated net proved reserve volumes by and replacing of our production 
we made a new field discovery at floyd south 
we expanded our diablo project area with two new joint ventures 
we acquired two new d seismic data sets in the gulf coast  which have already generated four discoveries in four attempts 
we reported operating income of million  up when compared to operating income for our earnings for were per diluted share relative to a net loss of in 
table of contents our common stock offering in september  combined with the exercise of the series a and series b warrants and our earnings  improved our balance sheet and strengthened our overall financial position by reducing our total debt to capitalization ratio from at december  to at december  in november  we significantly increased our drilling expenditures 
we plan to use the availability under our senior credit facility  along with our internally generated cash flow and cash on hand  to accelerate our drilling activities in the current environment of high commodity prices and relatively low service costs 
outlook our total net capital spending budget for is million 
the majority of our planned expenditures will be directed toward the drilling of our exploration and development inventory to focus resources on our primary objective of growing our reserves  production volumes and cash flow 
for  we expect to drill development and exploratory wells with an average working interest of approximately 
capitalizing on our prior discoveries  including the home run  mills ranch  triple crown  floyd fault block  floyd south fault block and providence fields  approximately of our drilling expenditures are allocated to development drilling 
our current cash balance  cash flow from operations and availability under our senior credit facility  will fund our spending 
estimated net capital expenditures for represent an increase of approximately over the amount that we spent in the final determination with respect to our budgeted expenditures will depend on a number of factors  including commodity prices  production from our existing producing wells  the results of our current exploration and development drilling efforts  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  including the availability of drilling equipment  and the availability of more economically attractive prospects 
there can be no assurance that the budgeted wells will  if drilled  encounter commercial quantities of natural gas or oil

critical accounting policies the establishment and consistent application of accounting policies is a vital component of accurately and fairly presenting our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as well as ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing financial reporting 
while there are rarely alternative methods or rules from which to select in establishing accounting and financial reporting policies  proper application often involves significant judgment regarding a given set of facts and circumstances and a complex series of decisions 
property and equipment the method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties is a critical accounting policy because it determines what costs are capitalized  and how these costs are ultimately matched with revenues and expensed 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method substantially all costs associated with oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are capitalized  including costs for individual exploration projects that do not directly result in the discovery of hydrocarbon reserves that can be economically recovered 
a portion of the payroll  interest  and other internal costs we incur for the purpose of finding hydrocarbon reserves are also capitalized 
full cost pool amounts associated with properties that have been evaluated through drilling or seismic analysis are depleted using the units of production method 
the depletion expense per unit of production is the ratio of unamortized historical and estimated future development costs to proven hydrocarbon reserve volumes 
estimation of hydrocarbon reserves relies on professional judgment and use of factors that cannot be precisely determined 
subsequent reserve estimates materially different from those reported would change the depletion expense recognized during the future reporting period 
for the year ended december   our depletion expense per unit of production was per mcfe 
a change of  mcfe in our estimated net proved reserves at december   would result in a per mcfe change in our per unit depletion expense and a  change in our pre tax net income 
to the extent costs capitalized in the full cost pool net of depreciation  depletion and amortization and related deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate and based on period end hedge adjusted oil and natural gas prices of estimated future net 
table of contents cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves plus the capitalized cost of unproved properties  such costs are charged to operations as a reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  or a capitalized ceiling impairment charge 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed  even if the low prices are temporary 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if we experience poor drilling results or estimations of proved reserves are substantially reduced 
a capitalized ceiling impairment is a reduction in earnings that does not impact cash flows  but does impact operating income and stockholders equity 
once recognized  a capitalized ceiling impairment charge to oil and natural gas properties cannot be reversed at a later date 
no assurance can be given that we will not experience a capitalized ceiling impairment charge in future periods 
in addition  capitalized ceiling impairment charges may occur if estimates of proved hydrocarbon reserves are substantially reduced or estimates of future development costs increase significantly 
see risk factors exploratory drilling is a speculative activity that may not result in commercially productive reserves and may require expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts  risk factors the failure to replace reserves in the future would adversely affect our production and cash flows and risk factors we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and future net cash flows 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to plug and abandon oil and natural gas wells and related equipment 
liabilities for asset retirement obligations are recorded at fair value in the period incurred 
the related asset value is increased by the same amount 
asset retirement costs included in the carrying amount of the related asset are subsequently allocated to expense as part of our depletion calculation 
see property and equipment 
additionally  increases in the discounted asset retirement liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion of discount on asset retirement obligations expense in the consolidated statement of income 
estimating future asset retirement obligations requires us to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  existence of a liability  as well as what constitutes adequate restoration 
we use the present value of estimated cash flows related to our asset retirement obligations to determine the fair value 
present value calculations inherently incorporate numerous assumptions and judgments 
these include the ultimate retirement and restoration costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment will be made to the carrying cost of the related asset 
income taxes deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences in financial statement and tax basis amounts that will result in deductible amounts and carry forwards in future years 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will result in taxable amounts in future years 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax law and tax rate s for the year in which we expect the temporary differences to be deducted or settled 
the effect of a change in tax law or rates on the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period of enactment 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
estimating the amount of the valuation allowance is dependent on estimates of future taxable income  alternative minimum tax income  and changes in stockholder ownership that would trigger limits on use of net operating losses under internal revenue code section we have a significant deferred tax asset associated with net operating loss carryforwards nols 
it is more likely than not that we could begin using these nols to offset current tax liabilities during our nols are more fully described in notes to the consolidated financial statements note revenue recognition we derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced oil and natural gas  hence our revenue recognition policy for these sales is significant 
we recognize crude oil revenue using the sales method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized when oil is delivered and title transfers 
we recognize natural gas revenue using the entitlements method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized based on 
table of contents our entitled ownership percentage of sales of natural gas delivered to purchasers 
gas imbalances occur when we sell more or less than our entitled ownership percentage of total natural gas production 
when we receive less than our entitled share  a receivable is recorded 
when we receive more than our entitled share  a liability is recorded 
settlements for hydrocarbon sales can occur up to two months after the end of the month in which the oil  gas or other hydrocarbon products were produced 
we estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available at the time financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period that payments are received from the purchaser 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we use derivative instruments to manage market risks resulting from fluctuations in commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
we periodically enter into commodity contracts  including price swaps  caps and floors  which require payments to or receipts from counterparties based on the differential between a fixed price and a variable price for a fixed quantity of natural gas or crude oil without the exchange of underlying volumes 
the notional amounts of these financial instruments are based on expected production from existing wells 
we similarly use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on long term debt 
during we entered into an interest rate swap to convert the floating interest rate on our senior subordinated notes to a fixed interest rate to reduce our exposure to potentially higher interest rates in the future 
the notional amount of this hedge is equal to the amount of senior subordinated notes outstanding  and is more fully described in notes to the consolidated financial statements note and notes to the consolidated financial statements note we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas on january  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb requirements 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction  and depending on the type of hedge transaction 
our derivative contracts are cash flow hedge transactions in which we are hedging the variability of cash flow related to a forecasted transaction 
changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are reported in other comprehensive income and reclassified as earnings in the period s in which earnings are impacted by the variability of the cash flow of the hedged item 
we assess the effectiveness of hedging transactions every three months  consistent with documented risk management strategy for the particular hedging relationship 
changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of hedges are included in earnings 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and some narrative disclosures 
hydrocarbon reserves  future development costs  and certain hydrocarbon production expense and revenue estimates are the most critical to our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas requires us to classify certain financial instruments  such as mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  as liabilities or assets in some circumstances 
we adopted this standard as required on july  upon adoption  approximately million of mandatorily redeemable series a and b preferred stock was reclassified to long term debt 
dividends of approximately  on the reclassified amount of mandatorily redeemable series a and b preferred stock are included in our consolidated statement of operations as interest expense 
commodity prices changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and operating results 
price changes directly affect revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of available capital to reinvest in our exploration and development activities 
commodity prices are impacted by many factors that are outside of our control 
over the past couple of years  commodity prices have been very volatile 
we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and natural gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 

table of contents the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
during  oil prices increased in response to political unrest and supply disruptions in the middle east as well as other supply and demand factors 
our average sales price for oil in was per barrel  which was higher than the price we received in significant factors that will impact oil prices include developments in iraq and other middle east countries  the extent to which members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other oil exporting nations are able to manage oil supply through export quotas 
north american market forces primarily drive the price we receive for our natural gas production 
factors that can affect the price of natural gas are changes in market demands  overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
over the past two years natural gas prices have been volatile 
the average sales price that we received for natural gas in was per mcf  which was higher than the sales price that we received for sales in the average sales price that we received for natural gas in was per mcf  which was lower than the sales price that we received in the increase north american gas prices in were in response to strong supply and demand fundamentals 
natural gas prices for will depend on variations in key north american gas supply and demand indicators 
capital commitments our primary needs for cash are for the exploration and development of oil and gas properties  repayment of contractual obligations and funding working capital obligations 
funding for the exploration and development of oil and gas properties and repayment of contractual obligations may be provided by any combination of cash flow from operations  cash on our balance sheet  the unused committed borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility  reimbursements of prior land and seismic costs by participants in our projects and the sale of interests in projects and properties or alternative financing sources as discussed in capital resources and liquidity 
funding for our working capital obligations is provided by cash flows from operations and the unused committed borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility

table of contents d not reduced by rental payments that we will receive from a non cancelable sublease of approximately  due in and  due in senior credit facility as of december   we had million in borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility 
in march  we replaced our then existing senior credit facility with a new senior credit facility that provides for a maximum million in commitments and an initial committed borrowing base of million and matures in march the collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined semi annually and are based in part on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
if  upon redetermination  our borrowing base decreases  we may have to repay a portion of our borrowings within days  our access to further borrowings will be reduced  and we may not have the resources necessary to carry out our planned drilling activities 
based on the most recent determination effective december   the committed borrowing base was set at million

interest is due quarterly for base rate tranches or periodically as libor tranches mature 
the senior credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions  which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell properties  purchase or redeem our capital stock  make investments or loans  create liens and make certain acquisitions 
our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a current ratio as defined of at least to and an interest coverage ratio as defined of at least to should we be unable to comply with these or other covenants  our senior lenders may be unwilling to waive compliance or amend the covenants in the future 
in such instance  our liquidity may be adversely affected  which could in turn have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
our current ratio at december  and interest coverage ratio for the twelve month period ending december   were to and to  respectively 
senior subordinated notes as of december   we had million of senior subordinated notes outstanding 
the terms of the senior subordinated notes were amended in march in order to have the covenants and other features of the notes mirror those of the new senior credit facility put in place at the same time

table of contents mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as of december   we had million in mandatorily redeemable series a preferred stock outstanding  which is held by merchant banking funds managed by affiliates of csfb private equity 
at our option  the dividends on our series a preferred stock may be paid in cash at a rate of per annum or paid in kind through the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock in lieu of cash at a rate of per annum 
our option to pay dividends in kind expires in october to date  we have satisfied all of the dividend payments with issuance of additional shares of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock matures in november and is redeemable at our option at or of the stated value per share depending upon certain conditions at anytime prior to maturity 
our preferred stock balance outstanding at december   represents the balance of preferred stock that remained outstanding after csfb private equity exercised its warrants to purchase our common stock in november and december of this year 
over the past four years we have issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to csfb private equity on three different occasions 
the first issuance was in november million series a tranche  the second issuance was in march million series a tranche and the third issuance was in december million series b 
in connection with each issuance of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  we issued to csfb private equity warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
to exercise the warrants  csfb private equity had the option to use either cash or shares of our mandatorily redeemable preferred stock with an aggregate value equal to the exercise price 
in november  in connection with the series a tranche we issued csfb private equity warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
in march  in connection with the series a tranche we issued csfb private equity warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
the exercise price on the warrants issued in march was later reset to in connection with the issuance of the december series b preferred stock and warrant offering 
in december  in connection with the series b we issued csfb private equity warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as part of each warrant agreement  we had the option to require csfb private equity to exercise the warrants if the price of our common stock met certain thresholds over a certain period of time 
in the event our stock price closed above per share each day for consecutive days  we could require csfb private equity to exercise the warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of

in november  our stock price met the threshold  which enabled us to require csfb private equity to exercise the warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
in november  our average stock price met the threshold  which enabled us to require csfb private equity to exercise the warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of and the warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
in all three cases  we required csfb private equity to exercise the warrants 
the combined exercise price of the warrants was million and csfb private equity elected to use  shares of series a preferred stock and  shares of series b preferred stock to pay for the exercise of the warrants 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the series b preferred stock we paid csfb private equity approximately  to redeem the shares of series b preferred stock that remained outstanding after the exercise 
our outstanding balance of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock at december   consisted of the series a shares that remained outstanding after the exercise and an additional  series a shares issued to satisfy pay in kind dividends for the fourth quarter of 
table of contents capital expenditures the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant

the remaining million of the increase in oil and natural gas sales was due to an increase in our production volumes 
the increases in total revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas due to higher prices and increased production volumes were partially offset by a increase in losses due to the cash settlement of derivative commodity contracts 
our total revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas in was lower than total revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas in the change in our total revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas from to is due to the following approximately million of the decrease in oil and natural gas sales was due to a per mcfe decline in the average sales price that we received for oil and natural gas 
the decrease in oil and natural gas sales due to a decline in the average sales price that we received for oil and natural gas was partially offset by a million increase in oil and natural gas sales related to an increase in oil and natural gas production 
the decrease in total revenue from oil and natural gas sales due to a decline in the average sales price that we received for oil and natural gas was partially offset by a decrease in losses due to the cash settlement of derivative commodity contracts

other revenue relates to fees that we charge other parties who use our two gas gathering systems to move their production from the wellhead to third party gas pipeline systems 
these gathering systems are owned by us and located in the texas gulf coast 
one of the gathering systems connects to a single well and the other connects two wells

lease operating expenses are driven in part by the type of commodity produced  the level of workover activity and the geographical location of the properties 
oil is inherently more expensive to produce than natural gas 

table of contents local taxing authorities such as school districts  cities  and counties or boroughs generally impose the ad valorem taxes we pay 
the amount of the tax is based on the value of the property assessed or determined by the taxing authority on an annual basis  and a percent of value 
when oil and natural gas commodity prices rise  the value of our underlying property interests increase 
this results in higher ad valorem taxes 
for compared to  approximately of the increase in total lease operating expenses was due to an increase in workover activity  while of the increase was related to an increase in operating and maintenance expense and was related to an increase in ad valorem taxes 
on a per unit basis  our lease operating expenses for were per mcfe compared to in the increase in lease operating expense was primarily due to the following an increase in workover activity represented of the increase in lease operating expenses  with two workovers performed on two wells accounting for of this increase 
the remaining of the increase in lease operating expenses was due to increases in overhead fees  insurance  compressor rental and maintenance  saltwater disposal cost  cost for electricity  fuel and power and miscellaneous lease operating expenses 
these increases were partly offset by decreases in contract service and labor expenses  lease and well abandonment expenses  lease maintenance expenses and surface equipment repair expenses

these increases were offset by decreases in well service and repair expenses 
production taxes in the us there are a variety of state and federal taxes levied on the production of oil and natural gas 
these are commonly grouped together and referred to as production taxes 
the majority of our production tax expense is based on a percent of gross value at the well at the time the production is sold or removed from the lease 
as a result  our production tax expense increases with increases in crude oil and natural gas commodity prices 
historically  taxing authorities have occasionally encouraged oil and gas industry to explore for new oil and natural gas reserves  or develop high cost reserves through reduced tax rates or credits 
these incentives have been narrow in scope and short lived 
a small number of our wells currently qualify for reduced production taxes because they are discoveries based on the use of d seismic or high cost wells 
for compared to  the increase in production taxes was due to an increase in the sales prices that we received for both oil and natural gas

income tax benefit 
realization of deferred tax assets associated with i nols  and ii existing temporary differences between book and taxable income is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character ie  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryforward period available under tax law 
prior to the current year  management believed that it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would not be realized and  therefore  reflected a comparable valuation allowance 
however  as a result mainly of the increased level of capital expenditures resulting from the september equity offering  management now believes that brigham should i begin to utilize nol s  and ii have reversals of existing temporary differences between book and taxable income sufficient to result in future deferred tax liabilities 
therefore  we have recognized a deferred tax asset at december   of million  consisting of a million income tax benefit and a million tax effect of unrealized hedging losses

cash will be required to fund capital expenditures for the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties necessary to offset the inherent declines in production and proven reserves typical in an extractive industry like ours 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on our access to cost effective capital resources and our success in economically finding and producing additional reserves 
we believe that cash on hand  net cash provided by operating activities  and the unused committed borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility will be adequate to satisfy future financial obligations and liquidity 
in the current environment of higher commodity prices  there may be increased demand for drilling equipment and services  leases and economically attractive prospects  which then may result in less availability and higher costs to us for those resources 
also  we may face additional competition from both domestic and international sources of supply  which may exert a downward pressure on the prices we ultimately receive for our products 
in addition  a significant known trend expected by our management to have an effect on our liquidity is our plan to accelerate our drilling activities in relative to recent prior years 
see item properties  overview and outlook for additional discussion about our capital expenditure program 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities is a function of the prices we receive from the sale of oil and natural gas  which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  production  operating cost  our cost of capital and capital spending 
our asset base  as with other extractive industries  is a depleting one in which each mcf of natural gas or barrel of oil produced must be replaced or our ability to generate cash flow  and thus sustain our exploration and development activities  will diminish 
see risk factors our future operating results may fluctuate and significant declines in them would limit our ability to invest in projects and risk factors the failure to replace reserves in the future would adversely affect our production and cash flows 
year ended december  change change dollars in thousands net cash flow provided by operating activities for compared to  higher commodity prices combined with lower cash interest costs were the primary reasons for the 
table of contents million increase in net cash provided by operating activities 
the higher commodity prices and lower cash interest costs were partially offset by an increase in production costs 
our working capital deficit at december   was million compared to a working capital deficit of  at december  working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
it is normal for us to report a working capital deficit at the end of a period 
these deficits are primarily the result of accounts payable related to lease operating expenses  exploration and development costs  royalties payable and gas imbalances payable 
settlement of these payables will be funded by cash flows from operations or  if necessary  by additional borrowing under our senior credit facility 
our gas imbalance related to the wells in home run triple crown and floyd fault block fields was partially settled in november due to the settlement  we borrowed an additional million under our senior credit facility 
the settlement reduced the balance of our gas imbalance payable by million and reduced the balance of our gas imbalance receivable by approximately million 
at december   current liabilities included a liability of million related to the fair value of hedging contracts 
for compared to  net cash provided by operating activities increased million 
these changes were primarily due to an increase in our post hedge realized sales prices for oil and natural gas and a decrease in interest expense related to our senior credit facility

at december  we had a working capital deficit of  compared to a working capital surplus of million at december  cash flows from financing activities over the three year period ended december   we have entered into various financing transactions with the intent of reducing our cost of capital and increasing our liquidity so that we could fund our capital expenditures for the exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties

we paid  in fees related to the amendment of our senior subordinated credit agreement in december other matters derivative instruments our results of operations and operating cash flow are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
we believe the use of derivative instruments  although not free of risk  allows us to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas sales price fluctuations and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
while the use of derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
moreover  our hedging arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our hedges will vary from time to time

table of contents effects of inflation and changes in prices our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and natural gas prices 
if the price of oil and natural gas increases decreases  there could be a corresponding increase decrease in revenues as well as the operating costs that we are required to bear for operations 
inflation has had a minimal effect on us 
environmental and other regulatory matters our business is subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and the development  production and marketing of oil and natural gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
any suspensions  terminations or inability to meet applicable bonding requirements could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to us  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our earnings or competitive position 
future regulations may add to the cost of  or significantly limit  drilling activity 
see risk factors we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks and item business governmental regulation and item business environmental matters 
risk factors our level of indebtedness may adversely affect our cash available for operations  thus limiting our growth  our ability to make interest and principal payments on our indebtedness as they become due and our flexibility to respond to market changes 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our operations  including those listed below 
we will dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on our indebtedness and to the payment of our other current obligations  and will not have these cash flows available for other purposes 
the covenants in our credit facilities limit our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets and may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions 
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and our ability to withstand sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices may be impaired 
since our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates  we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in market conditions may be limited 
we may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration and development activities 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on future performance 
general economic conditions  oil and gas prices and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt  and future working capital  borrowings and equity financing may not be available to pay or refinance such debt 
in addition  under the terms of our senior credit facility  our borrowing base is subject to semi annual redeterminations based in part on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
in the event the amount outstanding exceeds the redetermined borrowing base  we could be forced to repay a portion of our borrowings 
we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments 
if we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing  we may have to sell significant assets 

table of contents we have substantial capital requirements for which we may not be able to obtain adequate financing 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects 
without additional capital resources  our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
we may not be able to secure additional financing on reasonable terms or at all  and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing or new financing arrangements 
oil and natural gas prices fluctuate widely and low prices could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results by limiting our liquidity and flexibility to carry out our drilling program 
our revenues  operating results and future rate of growth depend highly upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
market prices of oil and natural gas depend on many factors beyond our control  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  and the overall economic environment 
we cannot predict future oil and natural gas price movements and prices often vary significantly 
significant declines in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may have the following effects on our business limit our financial condition  liquidity  ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations  reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  cause us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects  reduce our revenues  operating income and cash flow  and reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
our hedging transactions could reduce revenues in a rising commodity price environment or expose us to other risks 
in an attempt to reduce our sensitivity to energy price volatility  we may use hedging arrangements that generally result in a fixed price or a range of minimum and maximum price limits over a specified time period 
hedging contracts limit the benefits we would otherwise realize if actual prices rise above the contract price 
our hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
for example  if we do not produce our oil 
table of contents and natural gas reserves at rates equivalent to our hedged position  we would be required to satisfy our obligations under hedging contracts on potentially unfavorable terms without the ability to hedge that risk through sales of comparable quantities of our own production 
this situation occurred during portions of  due in part to our sale of certain producing reserves in mid and reduced our cash flow in by approximately million 
additionally  because the terms of our hedging contracts are based on assumptions and estimates of numerous factors such as cost of production and pipeline and other transportation and marketing costs to delivery points  substantial differences between the hedged prices and our actual results could harm our anticipated profit margins and our ability to manage the risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
we also could be financially harmed if the counter parties to our hedging contracts prove unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under such contracts 
additionally  in the past  some of our hedging contracts required us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counter parties in the event that our payment obligations exceeded certain levels 
future collateral requirements are uncertain but will depend on arrangements with our counter parties and highly volatile natural gas and oil prices 
exploratory drilling is a speculative activity that may not result in commercially productive reserves and may require expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts 
our future rate of growth depends highly upon the success of our exploratory drilling program 
exploratory drilling involves a higher risk that we will not encounter commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs than developmental drilling 
we cannot predict the cost of drilling  and we may be forced to limit  delay or cancel drilling operations as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements  and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment 
we may not be successful in our future drilling activities because even with the use of d seismic and other advanced technologies  exploratory drilling is a speculative activity 
we could incur losses because our use of d seismic data and other advanced technologies requires greater pre drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies 
even when fully utilized and properly interpreted  our d seismic data and other advanced technologies only assist us in identifying subsurface structures and do not indicate whether hydrocarbons are in fact present in those structures 
in addition  such seismic interpretations are not substantiated without drilling which may even invalidate previously accepted interpretations  require more processing and or interpretation expense or condemn an area 
because we interpret the areas desirable for drilling from d seismic data gathered over large areas  we may not acquire option and lease rights until after the seismic data is available and  in some cases  until the drilling locations are also identified 
we may never lease  drill or produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations 
we may not be successful in our drilling activities  our overall drilling success rate for activity within a particular province may not be maintained  and our completed wells may not ultimately produce our estimated economically recoverable reserves 
unsuccessful drilling activities could result in a significant decline in our production and revenues and materially harm our operations and financial condition by reducing our available cash and resources 
we are subject to various operating and other casualty risks that could result in liability exposure or the loss of production and revenues 
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for and producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as fires  natural disasters  formations with abnormal pressures  blowouts  cratering and explosions  and 
table of contents pipeline ruptures and spills 
any of these hazards and risks can result in the loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims and other damage to our properties and the property of others 
we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks we face  which could result in significant financial exposure 
we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
if an event occurs that is not covered  or not fully covered  by insurance  it could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot fully insure against pollution and environmental risks 
we cannot control the activities on properties we do not operate and are unable to ensure their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  or an operator s breach of the applicable agreements  could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  inclusion of other participants in drilling wells  and use of technology 
the marketability of our natural gas production depends on facilities that we typically do not own or control which could result in a curtailment of production and revenues 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
we generally deliver natural gas through gas gathering systems and gas pipelines that we do not own under interruptible or short term transportation agreements 
under the interruptible transportation agreements  the transportation of our gas may be interrupted due to capacity constraints on the applicable system  for maintenance or repair of the system  or for other reasons as dictated by the particular agreements 
our ability to produce and market natural gas on a commercial basis could be harmed by any significant change in the cost or availability of such markets  systems or pipelines 
lower oil and natural gas prices may cause us to record ceiling limitation write downs which would reduce our stockholders equity 
we use the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and gas properties 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit that is based upon the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of the cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are low or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
we have had operating losses in the past and may not be profitable in the future 
we may not be profitable in the future 
we have recognized the following annual net losses since million including a net million non cash deferred income tax charge incurred in connection with our conversion from a partnership to a corporation in 
table of contents  million including a million non cash write down in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties in  million including a million non cash loss on the sale of oil and natural gas properties in  and million in our future operating results may fluctuate and significant declines in them would limit our ability to invest in projects 
our future operating results may fluctuate significantly depending upon a number of factors  including industry conditions  prices of oil and natural gas  rates of drilling success  capital availability  rates of production from completed wells  and the timing and amount of capital expenditures 
this variability could cause our business  financial condition and results of operations to suffer 
in addition  any failure or delay in the realization of expected cash flows from operating activities could limit our ability to invest and participate in economically attractive projects 
the failure to replace reserves in the future would adversely affect our production and cash flows 
in general  production from oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics 
except to the extent we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both  our proved reserves and production will decline as reserves are produced 
the business of exploring for or developing reserves is capital intensive 
reductions in our cash flow from operations and limitations on or unavailability of external sources of capital may impair our ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our asset base of oil and natural gas reserves 
in addition  our future exploration and development activities may not result in additional proved reserves  and we may not be able to drill productive wells at acceptable costs 
we are subject to uncertainties in reserve estimates and future net cash flows 
there is substantial uncertainty in estimating quantities of proved reserves and projecting future production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
no one can measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way 
accordingly  oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimations of those accumulations 
estimates of other engineers might differ widely from those of our independent petroleum engineers 
accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
our independent petroleum engineers may make material changes to reserve estimates based on the results of actual drilling  testing  and production 
as a result  our reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas we ultimately recover 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions could greatly affect our estimates of reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows 
because most of our reserve estimates are without the benefit of a lengthy production history and are calculated using volumetric analysis  those estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
volumetric analysis involves estimating the volume of a reservoir based on the net feet of pay of the structure and an estimation of the area covered by the structure based on seismic analysis 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the day of estimate 
however  actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as 
table of contents actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas  the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  limits or increases in consumption by gas purchasers  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows in compliance with the securities and exchange commission reporting requirements may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
we face significant competition  and many of our competitors have resources in excess of our available resources 
we operate in the highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation  acquisition and production 
we face intense competition from a large number of independent  technology driven companies as well as both major and other independent oil and natural gas companies in a number of areas such as seeking to acquire desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  marketing our oil and natural gas production  and seeking to acquire the equipment and expertise necessary to operate and develop those properties 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially in excess of those available to us 
this highly competitive environment could harm our business 
we are subject to various governmental regulations and environmental risks which may cause us to incur substantial costs 
our business is subject to laws and regulations promulgated by federal  state and local authorities  including the ferc  the environmental protection agency  the texas railroad commission  the tceq and the oklahoma corporation commission  relating to the exploration for  and the development  production and marketing of  oil and natural gas  as well as safety matters 
legal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations 
our operations are subject to complex federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including the cercla  the rcra  the opa and the clean water act 
environmental laws and regulations change frequently  and the implementation of new  or the modification of existing  laws or regulations could harm us 
the discharge of natural gas  oil  or other pollutants into the air  soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to the government and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation 
our business may suffer if we lose key personnel 
if we lose the services of our key management personnel or technical experts or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  our business  financial condition  results of operations  development efforts and ability to grow could suffer 
we have assembled a team of geologists  geophysicists and engineers who have considerable experience in applying d seismic imaging technology to explore for and to develop oil and natural gas 
we depend upon the knowledge  skill and experience of these experts to provide d seismic imaging and to assist us in reducing the risks associated with our participation in oil and natural gas exploration and development projects 
in addition  the success of our business depends  to a significant extent  upon the abilities and continued efforts of our management  particularly ben m 
brigham  our chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board 
we have an employment agreement with mr 
brigham  but do not have an employment agreement with any of our other employees 

table of contents our shares that are eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or a perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity securities 
as of december   one of our stockholders  together with its affiliates  owned  shares of our common stock 
furthermore  this stockholder and other stockholders have the right to demand that we file a registration statement under the securities act covering the sale of their shares of common stock 
certain of our affiliates control a majority of our outstanding common stock  which may affect your vote as a stockholder 
our directors  executive officers and or greater stockholders  and certain of their affiliates beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  these stockholders  as a group  will be able to control the outcome of stockholder votes  including votes concerning the election of directors  the adoption or amendment of provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws  and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
the existence of these levels of ownership concentrated in a few persons makes it unlikely that any other holder of common stock will be able to affect our management or direction 
these factors may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our management or voting control 
certain anti takeover provisions may affect your rights as a stockholder 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to set the rights  preferences and other designations  including voting rights  of those shares as the board of directors may determine 
in addition  our outstanding series a preferred stock  our senior credit facility and our senior subordinated notes contain terms restricting our ability to enter into change of control transactions  including requirements to redeem or repay the series a preferred stock  our senior credit facility and our senior subordinated notes upon a change in control 
these provisions  alone or in combination with the other matters described in the preceding paragraph may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes in our control  including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock 
we are also subject to provisions of the delaware general corporation law that may make some business combinations more difficult 
the market price of our stock is volatile 
the trading price of our common stock and the price at which we may sell securities in the future is subject to large fluctuations in response to any of the following limited trading volume in our stock  changes in government regulations  quarterly variations in operating results  our involvement in litigation  general market conditions  the prices of oil and natural gas  announcements by us and our competitors  our liquidity  our ability to raise additional funds  and other events

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management opinion concerning derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity prices and interest rate risks 
our objectives for holding derivatives are to achieve a consistent level of cash flow to support a portion of our planned capital spending 
our use of derivative instruments for hedging activities could materially affect our results of operations in particular quarterly or annual periods since such instruments can limit our ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
fair value of derivative contracts the fair value of our derivative contracts is determined based on counterparties estimates and valuation models 
we did not change our valuation methodology during the year ended december  during  we were party to natural gas swap contracts  natural gas floor contracts  oil swaps  oil collar contracts and interest rate swaps 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements note for additional information regarding our derivative contracts 
the following table reconciles the changes that occurred in the fair values of our open derivative contracts during fair value of derivative contracts estimated fair value of open contracts at december  change fair values of contracts fixed price natural gas swaps natural gas collars fixed price oil swaps oil collars interest rate swap contract settlements fixed price natural gas swaps natural gas collars fixed price oil swaps oil collars interest rate swap estimated fair value of open contracts at december  based upon the market prices at december   we expect to transfer approximately million of the loss included on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to earnings during the next twelve months when transactions actually occur 
commodity price risk our primary commodity market risk exposure is to changes in the prices related to the sale of our oil and natural gas production 
the market prices for oil and natural gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
as such  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the sales prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production using derivative instruments 
we believe the use of derivative instruments  although not free of risk  allows us to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas sales price fluctuations and thereby achieve a more predictable cash flow 
while the use of derivative instruments limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
moreover  our hedging arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our hedges will vary from time to time 

table of contents the gas derivative transactions are generally settled based upon the average of the reporting settlement prices on the nymex for the last three trading days of a particular contract month 
the oil derivative transactions are generally settled based on the average reporting settlement prices on the nymex for each trading day of a particular calendar month 
as of march   our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps and collars 
for swap instruments  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price  as defined in each instrument  to the counterparty 
these instruments are settled monthly 
when the floating price exceeds the fixed price for a contract month  we pay the counterparty 
when the fixed price exceeds the floating price  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us 
we have designated theses swap instruments as cash flow hedges designed to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as reduce our exposure to price volatility 
for collar instruments  we establish a floor and ceiling price on future commodity production 
these instruments are settled monthly 
when the settlement price for a period is above the ceiling price  we pay the counterparty 
when the settlement price for a period is below the floor price  the counterparty is required to pay us 
we have designated these collar instruments as cash flow hedges designed to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as reduce our exposure to price volatility

our fixed rate debt consists of million in senior subordinated notes and million in mandatorily redeemable series a preferred stock 
the estimated fair value of our senior subordinated notes at december   was million 
dividends on our series a preferred stock may be paid in cash at a rate of per annum or paid in kind through the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock in lieu of cash at a rate of per annum 
our option to pay dividends in kind expires in november the carrying value of the mandatorily redeemable series a preferred stock approximates its fair value as this is the amount that we would have to pay to extinguish the preferred stock 
the remaining million in outstanding debt at december   was related to borrowings under our senior credit facility 
at our option  borrowings under our senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to i the base rate of soci t g n rale plus a margin which fluctuates from to depending on facility usage or ii libor for one  two  three or six months plus a margin which fluctuates from to depending on facility usage 
the weighted average interest rate on these borrowings at december   was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would equal approximately basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would impact our annual interest expense by approximately  assuming borrowed amounts under our senior credit facilities remained at million 
as the interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value
