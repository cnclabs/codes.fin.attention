this plant closure was originally expected to be completed during the first quarter of fiscal but we were able to close the plant by march  productivity improvements at our scottsburg  in plant created capacity for the integration of the las vegas business 
however  job start ups and the scope and complexity of the integration caused disruptions in the plant s normal production schedule

in  sales people were employed 
this increase in sales personnel occurred in order for the company to maximize sales opportunities in the marketplace

the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate in is due to the tax rate reflecting tax credits that did not reoccur in critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this requires us to establish accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies include those policies that involve may significant judgments and uncertainties 
we believe that the following policies are critical accounting policies 
for further information on these policies and other significant accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily major consumer brand companies and container manufacturers 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from our customers in connection with our normal business activities 
accounts receivable include an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific individual risks identified in our accounts receivable detail 
losses may also depend to some degree on future economic conditions 
although these conditions are unknown to us and may result in additional credit losses  we do not anticipate significant adverse credit circumstances in fiscal 
table of contents goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
the impairment test is completed based upon our assessment of the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
for purposes of these tests  we determined that each segment of multi color is one reporting unit 
the annual review for impairment of goodwill requires the use of estimates and assumptions which we believe are appropriate 
application of different estimates and assumptions or reviewing goodwill at a different reporting unit level could produce different results 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired and the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the determination of whether an impairment has occurred involves various estimates and assumptions  including the determination of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets involved in the review 
the cash flow estimates are based upon our historical experience  adjusted to reflect future market and operating conditions 
measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value 
we base our estimates of fair values on quoted market prices when available  independent appraisals as appropriate and industry trends or other market knowledge 
income taxes we follow sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis and reported book basis of assets and liabilities and result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
our accounting for deferred taxes involves certain estimates and assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
future changes in regulatory tax laws and or different positions held by taxing authorities may affect the value recorded for deferred taxes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations were  in and  in the cash flow generated in was reduced from the cash flow generated in primarily due to an increase in working capital related to our growth and acquisitions completed in and cash flows used in investing activities were  in and  in cash used in and was due to the acquisition of the heat transfer business of the international playing card and label company in fiscal and the acquisitions of quick pak and dec tech in fiscal capital expenditures were  in and  in capital expenditures were funded either through cash flow from operations or through the company s revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures were significant in and related primarily to a new gravure press being installed in our scottsburg  in plant and a new company wide business enterprise system 
budgeted capital expenditures for of approximately  are expected to be funded from operating cash flows in multi color had available under a revolving credit agreement  at march  to provide for additional cash needs 
we entered into the current credit agreement with pnc bank  key bank  lasalle bank and harris trust and savings bank on july  the credit agreement provides for a revolving line of credit up to a maximum of  and an acquisition facility of  which was partially utilized in july in connection with the acquisition of quick pak 
the acquisition facility expired in july under the terms of the credit agreement  multi color is subject to several financial covenants 
the financial covenants require multi color to maintain certain leverage and fixed charge ratios as well as maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants during we are prohibited from declaring dividends on the common stock of multi color under the agreement 
the credit agreement expires in july we expect to enter into an amended credit facility with the bank group described above by the end of our fiscal first quarter 
the amended credit facility provides for expanded borrowing capabilities with a revolving line of credit availability of  and an acquisition facility of up to  the financial covenants and other terms and conditions of the new facility will substantially the same as the current facility 
we believe that cash flow from operations and availability under the revolving line of credit  as amended  are sufficient to meet our capital requirements and debt service requirements for fiscal and for the next several fiscal years 
from time to time we review potential acquisitions of businesses 
while we has no present commitments to acquire any businesses that would have a material impact on multi color s financial position or results of operations  such an acquisition may require us to issue additional equity or incur additional debt

financial measures that supplement gaap we referred to data derived from consolidated financial statements but not required by gaap to be presented in financial statements 
certain of these data are considered to be non gaap financial measures under the sec regulations 
specifically  we referred to net income excluding the plant closure costs and impairment loss and gross profit excluding the gross profit shortfall generated by the las vegas plant 
we believe these costs to be unusual items and believe that investors may find it helpful to see the measures noted above

quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk thousands multi color is exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates in certain of its outstanding debt 
the outstanding loan balance under our bank credit facility bears interest at a variable rate based on prevailing short term interest rates in the united states and europe 
based on the average outstanding debt in fiscal  a basis point change in the interest rate would change interest expense by approximately in fiscal we did not use financial or derivative instruments to manage our interest risks 
we recently entered into an amended credit facility with our bank group and as part of the new credit facility we will be using financial instruments to manage our interest risks
