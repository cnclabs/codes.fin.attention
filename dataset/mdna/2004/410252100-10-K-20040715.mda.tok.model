the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and other various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates and assumptions described above 
the company believes that the following are its critical accounting policies recognition of revenues and future returns the company recognizes revenues upon delivery of product to customers fob destination 
as a category manager of music product  the company coordinates freight service for product purchased by its customers with the assumption of risk effectively remaining with the company until its customers receive the product 
customer inspection of merchandise is not a condition of the sale 
the company also manages product returns which include both salable and non salable product  as well as damaged merchandise  and provides credits for such customer returns 
the company reduces revenues and direct product costs for estimated future returns at the time of revenue recognition 
the estimate for future returns includes both salable and non salable product 
on a quarterly basis  the company reviews the estimates for future returns and records adjustments as necessary 
stock based compensation the company has stock based compensation plans in the form of stock options  performance shares and restricted stock 
beginning in fiscal  the company adopted the fair value based method of accounting for stock compensation plans  on a prospective basis  utilizing the black scholes option pricing model 
under the fair value method  the company measures awards as of the grant date and compensation expense is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
the company includes the value of stock based compensation in compensation expense  however  stock based awards granted prior to adoption of the fair value method  and after the restatement as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  are accounted for under the variable accounting method 
under variable accounting  the excess of market value over the option price of outstanding stock options is determined at each reporting period and aggregate compensation expense is adjusted and recognized over the vesting period 
compensation expense associated with vested options continues to be adjusted to the market value of the options until the options are either exercised or terminated 
stock based compensation expense is included as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
pension expense the determination of obligation and expense related to the company s pension plans is dependent upon the selection of certain assumptions used by the company s actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate is chosen with consideration given to market rates for long term corporate bonds  principally moody s aa year 
the expected long term rate of return for the company s pension plan assets is based on historical returns for the different asset classes  weighted based on the median of the target allocation for each asset class 
actual results could differ from the company s assumptions 
such differences are accumulated and amortized over future periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and  therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on reported income before income taxes and minority interest 
deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  consideration is given to estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future benefits and all available evidence 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
the company accounts for inventories using the full cost method which includes costs associated with acquiring and preparing inventory for distribution 
substantially all of the company s inventory is comprised of compact discs which are not substandard from a functional standpoint 
typically  the company s suppliers offer return privileges for excess inventory quantities 
inventory reserves are provided for the risk that exists related to the carrying value of non returnable slow moving inventory that may exceed market value  although the effect of markdowns is minimized since the company s vendors offer some level of return allowances and price protection 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the company s carrying value of inventory from a lower of cost or market perspective and makes any necessary carrying value adjustments 
the company also conducts physical inventory counts on a semi annual basis 
long lived assets at the end of each fiscal year  the company evaluates the carrying value and remaining estimated lives of long lived assets for potential impairment by considering several factors  including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results  market trends and other economic facts relating to the operation to which the assets apply 
recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of such assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement  the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets
