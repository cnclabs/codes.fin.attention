item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations  except in the section entitled discontinued operations 
executive overview we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists  cranes  chain  conveyors  material handling systems  lift tables and component parts serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end markets 
our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move  lift  position or secure objects and loads 
our products segment sells a wide variety of powered and manually operated wire rope and chain hoists  industrial crane systems  chain  hooks and attachments  actuators and rotary unions 
our solutions segment designs  manufactures  and installs application specific material handling systems and solutions for end users to improve work station and facility wide work flow 
founded in  we have grown to our current leadership position through organic growth and also as the result of the businesses we acquired between february and april we have developed our leading market position over our year history by emphasizing technological innovation  manufacturing excellence and superior after sale service 
in addition  the acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach  end user markets and customer base 
we continue to further integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our previously existing businesses 
the current phase of the ongoing integration of these businesses includes improving our productivity  further reducing our excess manufacturing capacity and extending our cross selling activities to the european marketplace 
this phase is in process through our lean manufacturing efforts  facility rationalization program and european sales initiatives 
our lean manufacturing efforts are fundamentally changing our manufacturing processes to be more responsive to customer demand  resulting in significant inventory reductions and improving on time delivery and productivity 
for example  we realized nearly inventory turn improvement to times at march  from times at march  specifically in fiscal  we realized approximately improvement from times at march  over the past three years  under our facility rationalization program  we have closed facilities and consolidated several product lines  with potential opportunity for further rationalization 
also  as previously reported  we have been undergoing assessments for possible divestiture of several less strategic businesses  including most of our solutions segment and certain businesses within our products segment 
two businesses were sold in fiscal and four others remain as possible divestiture candidates 
furthermore  we are selling real properties that resulted from our facility rationalization projects 
these divestitures may result in gains or losses 
to further expand our global sales  we have begun introducing certain of our products through our existing european distribution network that historically have been distributed only in north america 
many of the us industrial sectors that we serve have been impacted by soft economic conditions since mid these conditions deteriorated significantly in our fiscal fourth quarter and continued to decline throughout fiscal and  negatively impacting our net sales and financial performance 
we began to see some stabilization and then very modest improvement in the latter half of fiscal while reaching a historical high of million in fiscal  our net sales dropped by to million in fiscal  by an additional to million in fiscal and by an additional to million in fiscal  primarily due to this downturn in the business cycle 
despite these economic conditions and their impact on our operating results  we maintained our leading market share  generated positive cash flow from operations and business divestitures and repaid million  million and million of debt in fiscal  and  respectively 
we continue to be cautiously optimistic that the economic environment as it impacts our company is modestly improving 
we monitor such indicators as us industrial capacity utilization and industrial production which have been steadily increasing since july we sell our products domestically to a cross section of business sectors  spanning the breadth of primarily the industrial contributors to the us gross domestic product 
these sectors are impacted by these indicators in varying degrees and at various points in a business cycle 
we will continue to monitor these indicators to assess the impact on our future business 
in addition  to enhance future revenue opportunities  we are increasing our sales and marketing efforts in international markets and investing in new products and services as further described in item of this annual report within the section described as our strategy 
on the cost side we  like many companies  have been challenged over the past several years with significantly increased costs for fringe benefits such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and pension 
combined  those benefits cost us almost million in fiscal and we work dilingently with our advisors to balance cost control with the need to provide competitive benefits packages for our associates 
another cost area of focus is steel pricing 
we utilize approximately million of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod  wire  bar  structural and others 
with increases in worldwide demand for steel and significant increases in scrap steel prices  we have experienced increases in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
our surcharges went into effect beginning march  and currently affect most of our chain and forged attachment products 
we continue to monitor steel costs and potential surcharge requirements on a monthly basis 
results of operations net sales of our products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and with percentage changes for each segment  were as follows change change fiscal years ended march  vs 
vs 
amount amount products segment solutions segment total net sales sales in recent years were affected by the downturn in the general north american and european economies and the industrial sectors in particular 
net sales in fiscal of million decreased by million  or  from fiscal  and net sales in fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal our products segment net sales improved in fiscal as we saw stabilization by mid and improvement of in the latter half of the fiscal year 
fiscal products segment was marked with a decline  primarily due to decreased unit sales resulting from the soft us industrial markets 
both fiscal and were impacted by the weakening us dollar relative to other currencies  particularly the euro  and reported products segment sales were favorably affected by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our solutions segment net sales decreased and in fiscal and  respectively 
the declines in fiscal and were primarily due to soft us and european industrial markets  particularly affecting purchasing decisions for capital goods 
the fiscal decline was further impacted by the march divestiture of our steel erection business  which generated million and million of revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit of the products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of total segment net sales  was as follows fiscal years ended march  amount amount amount products segment solutions segment total gross profit our gross profit margins were approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the products segment reflected a stabilized gross profit margin in fiscal as the revenues stabilized during the year and costs were closely monitored 
the decrease in products segment gross profit margin for fiscal was primarily the result of economic and inventory reduction factors 
the product segment s gross profit margin decreased in fiscal due to the following factors i our price increase implementation was delayed eight months until august due to economic market conditions approximately million impact  ii cost increases  particularly for employee benefits such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and pension and also general property insurance approximately million impact  iii pricing pressure  especially on our capital type products such as cranes approximately million impact  iv the decline in net sales and the resulting decrease in absorption of fixed production costs  v production at levels lower than sales levels to reduce inventories and the resulting further decrease in absorption of fixed production costs  vi production inefficiencies at our facilities impacted by facility rationalization activities  and vii a million reclassification of certain crane builder expenses to cost of products sold from general and administrative expenses in fiscal the solutions segment s gross profit margins decreased in fiscal and primarily due to the and declines in net sales  respectively  and resulting decease in absorption of fixed production costs  increased employee benefits costs as described above and an increase in larger integrated solutions projects which carry a lower gross profit margin overall 
selling expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal and increases include million and million  respectively  resulting from the weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  particularly the euro  upon translation of foreign operating results into us dollars for reporting purposes 
the fiscal and increases also include million and million  respectively  resulting from reclassification of certain crane builder expenses from general and administrative expenses in fiscal to improve reporting consistency 
the fiscal increase further includes million for investing in new geographic markets and other increases for employee benefits costs  catalogs  and commissions in certain markets  partially offset by cost control measures 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
much of the expense reductions resulted from general discretionary cost control measures 
partially offsetting those savings  fiscal was unfavorably impacted by million resulting from the translation of foreign currencies into the weaker us dollar for reporting purposes and also included million higher bad debt expenses 
the fiscal expenses were favorably impacted by a million reduction in product liability expense due to reassessment of self insurance exposure relative to certain claims and the reclassification of million of crane builder expenses into cost of products sold or selling expense 
these fiscal favorable results were partially offset by million for professional fees for special projects to improve the company s organization structure  million for a business divested in march  million for intercompany exchange losses and million for increased bad debt expenses 
restructuring charges of million  million and million  or  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively  were primarily attributable to the closure or significant reorganization of thirteen manufacturing or warehouse facilities 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a result of our continued closure  merging and reorganization and completion of two open projects from fiscal the following facilities were closed  merged or significantly reorganized beginning in fiscal abingdon  va  tonawanda  ny  cobourg  ontario  canada  forest park  il  and reform  al 
excluding the tonawanda facility  these operations were included within our products segment  and were relocated into other existing products segment facilities 
fiscal charges included exit costs of million for severance relating to approximately employees  million of lease termination  facility wind down  preparation for sale and maintenance of non operating facilities prior to disposal and million for facility closure costs on projects begun in three of the five projects were completed as planned in the fourth quarter of fiscal while two were completed by the second quarter of fiscal the remaining liability of million for fiscal projects relates to the ongoing maintenance costs of the non operating facilities 
the following facilities were closed  merged or significantly reorganized beginning in fiscal houma  la  woodland  ca  romeoville  il  forrest city  ar  monterrey  mexico  hobro  denmark  atlanta  ga  and richmond  british columbia  canada 
all operations except for the hobro facility were included within our products segment  and all activities were relocated into other existing company facilities within their respective segments 
charges included exit costs of million for severance relating to approximately employees and million of lease termination  facility wind down  preparation for sale and maintenance of non operating facilities prior to disposal 
included in the restructuring charges was approximately million to terminate a facility lease  resulting in the purchase of the property with an estimated fair value of approximately million which was recorded as an offset to the restructuring charges 
due to changes in the real estate market and a reassessment of the fair value of the property  the net asset held for sale was adjusted downward by million as a further restructuring charge during fiscal all of the projects were completed as planned during fiscal the remaining liability of million relates to the ongoing maintenance costs of the non operating facility 
each rationalization project was analyzed based on our capacity and the cost structure of the specific facilities relative to others 
as a result of these rationalization projects we expect to achieve approximately million to million of annualized savings primarily in cost of products sold including facility fixed costs and employee costs  of which approximately million and million was realized during fiscal and  respectively 
we anticipate that our restructuring charges for fiscal in connection with our ongoing facility rationalization and reorganization initiatives will be between million and million 
write off amortization of intangibles was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal reflected a million goodwill write off in the fourth quarter relating to impairment under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which pronouncement eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets beginning in fiscal but added new impairment testing rules 
the fiscal amount relates primarily to non tax deductible goodwill amortization 
interest and debt expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  interest and debt expense was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease primarily resulted from lower debt levels 
the fiscal increase included a million write off of deferred financing costs associated with the company s former credit facility  which was replaced with a new credit arrangement in november  a portion of which carried higher effective interest rates than the company s former credit facility 
other income and expense  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the income in fiscal included million from asset sales and million from an interest rate swap partially offset by million of losses upon business divestitures 
the income in fiscal included million from asset sales offset by a million unrealized  non cash  mark to market loss recognized within our captive insurance company s securities portfolio and a million loss on a business divestiture 
the unrealized loss within the securities portfolio was recognized since it was deemed to be other than temporary in nature  resulting from unrealized losses that existed longer than a six month period 
the expense in fiscal similarly included a million unrealized  non cash  mark to market loss recognized on marketable securities held by our captive insurance subsidiary  a million loss on a business divestiture and a million gain on asset sales 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not reflective of u 
s statutory rates in fiscal  or primarily due to the impact of non deductible goodwill amortization write off in fiscal and and also due to varying tax jurisdiction rates on low or negative pretax income  and the existence of losses for which no tax benefit has been recorded 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we reduced goodwill by million as of the beginning of fiscal  reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our statement of operations 
a discounted cash flows approach was used to test goodwill for potential impairment 
liquidity and capital resources in november  we refinanced our credit facilities 
the new arrangement replaced our previous revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on march  the new arrangement consisted of a revolving credit facility  a term loan and a senior second secured term loan 
the revolving credit facility currently provides availability up to a maximum of million through march  availability based on the underlying collateral at march  amounted to million 
the unused revolving credit facility totaled million at march  with no borrowings outstanding but with million of outstanding letters of credit 
interest is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor or prime plus spreads determined by our leverage ratio  amounting to or basis points applied to each  respectively  at march  the term loan requires quarterly million payments with the balance due on march  at march   million was outstanding under the term loan 
interest is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor plus a spread determined by our leverage ratio  amounting to basis points at march the revolving credit facility and term loan are secured by all of our domestic tangible and intangible assets limited to for stock ownership of foreign subsidiaries 
in july  we issued million of senior secured notes due august  which remain outstanding at march  proceeds from this offering were used for the repayment in full of a then outstanding senior second secured term loan million  the repurchase of million of senior subordinated notes at a discount million  the repayment of a portion of the outstanding revolving credit facility million  the repayment of a portion of the term loan million  the payment of financing costs million and the payment of accrued interest million 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restricted payments 
the notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at prices declining annually from the make whole price as defined in the indenture for the notes 
in the event of a change of control as defined  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the notes are also secured  in a second lien position  by all domestic inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the redemption of a portion of the outstanding senior subordinated notes occurred at a discount resulting in a million pre tax gain on early extinguishment of debt 
as a result of the repayment of the senior second secured term loan and a portion of the term loan and senior subordinated notes  million of pre tax deferred financing costs were written off in fiscal the net effect of these two items  a million pre tax gain  is shown as part of other income and expense  net 
the corresponding credit agreements associated with the revolving credit facility and the term loan place certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including financial requirements and a restriction on dividend payments  with which we are currently in compliance 
from time to time  we manage our debt portfolio by using interest rate swaps to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates 
in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  which matured in june that cash flow hedge was considered effective and the gain or loss on the change in fair value was reported in other comprehensive income  net of tax 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt libor plus basis points through august and million from august through august at the same rate 
that interest rate swap was considered an ineffective hedge and therefore the change in fair value was recognized in income as a gain 
the swap was terminated in january and a pre tax gain of million was recognized as other income as a result of changes in the fair value of the swap 
at march   our senior subordinated notes issued on march  and due march  amounted to million  net of original issue discount 
interest is payable semi annually based on an effective rate of  considering million of proceeds from rate hedging in advance of the placement 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  indebtedness  asset sales and dividends and other restricted payments 
prior to april   the notes were redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at the make whole price as defined in the indenture for the notes 
on or after april   they are redeemable at prices declining annually from to on and after april  in the event of a change of control as defined  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon a steady economy and successful execution of our current business plan which is focused on cash generation for debt repayment 
the business plan includes continued implementation of lean manufacturing  facility rationalization projects  divestiture of excess facilities and certain non strategic operations  improving working capital components  including inventory reductions  and new market and new product development 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
overall  operating assets net of liabilities provided cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal and income tax refunds of million 
the million decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal was due to weaker operating performance in fiscal and to working capital changes 
in particular  trade accounts receivable and inventories provided cash of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and trade accounts payable used million of cash in fiscal but provided million of cash in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  and used in investing activities was million in fiscal the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million  respectively  from business and property divestitures 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
those amounts included million  million and million of debt repayment in fiscal  and  respectively  as well as million of dividends paid in fiscal we also paid million and million of financing costs in fiscal and  respectively  to effect the capital transactions previously described 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of march   by period of estimated payments due fiscal fiscal fiscal more than total fiscal fiscal five years long term debt obligations a 
operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c interest obligations d letter of credit obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap e total a as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
c we have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased 
we estimate that  at any given point in time  our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate million 
d estimated for our term loan due  senior secured notes due and senior subordinated notes due e as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no additional off balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above 
capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to support new product development  reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
further  our facility rationalization program underway over the past three years reduced our annual capital expenditure requirements and also provided for transfers of equipment from the rationalized facilities to other operating facilities 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decreased spending throughout the period reflects a deferral of certain projects due to soft market conditions  as well as reduced needs resulting from our facility rationalization program 
we expect capital expenditure spending to increase modestly in fiscal  to million 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico and the pacific rim 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases 
however  employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were impacted by high inflation in steel costs which varied by type of steel 
we generally incorporated those cost increases into our sales price increases effective in early fiscal as well as surcharges on certain products that began in march we continue to monitor steel costs and potential surcharge requirements on a monthly basis 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included cash of million and an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
accordingly  the asi operation was reflected as discontinued operations in our financial statements and all prior financial statements have been restated 
the loss from discontinued operations was million and in fiscal and the loss on the disposition of the discontinued operations was million  both reflected in our fiscal consolidated statement of operations 
cash provided by used in discontinued operations was million and million in fiscal and  respectively  as shown on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of  and as of march   and  respectively  are based on long term bond rates 
the decrease in discount rates for fiscal and resulted in million and million increases in the projected benefit obligations as of march  and  respectively 
the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of  and for the years ended march   and  respectively  are based on the composition of the asset portfolios approximately equities and fixed income at march  and their long term historical returns 
the actual assets realized gains of million in fiscal but sustained losses of million in fiscal accordingly  our funded status as of march  and was negative by million and million  or and  respectively 
to improve our funded status  we increased our pension contributions during fiscal by million over fiscal accordingly  our accrued pension cost decreased by million as of march  as compared to march  the negative funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
however  pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate fiscal expense 
these factors will also result in increases in funding requirements over time  unless there is continued significant market appreciation in the asset values 
however  pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year are expected to decrease by approximately million compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march   and is based on historical trends 
the healthcare inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal  and  respectively are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to our consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
we reassess trends and usage on a regular basis and if we identify changes we revise our estimated allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable agings 
long lived assets 
property  plants and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
these assets as well as goodwill are also periodically measured for impairment 
the assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective 
if actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated  we could incur a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal relating to these assets 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we consider market value declines to be other than temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as of march   the company had million of total net deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  million of the assets pertain to net operating loss carryforwards and the remainder relate principally to liabilities including employee benefit plans  insurance reserves  accrued vacation and incentive costs and also to asset valuation reserves such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire in a valuation allowance of million was recorded at march  due to the uncertainty of whether the company s net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
if we do not generate sufficient taxable income  we would record an additional valuation allowance 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when title passes to the customer  which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer  except for long term construction contracts 
for long term construction contracts  we recognize contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  measured by comparing direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
in the event that a loss is anticipated on an uncompleted contract  a provision for the estimated loss is made at the time it is determined 
billings on contracts may precede or lag revenues earned  and such differences are reported in the balance sheet as current liabilities accrued liabilities and current assets unbilled revenues  respectively 
customers do not routinely return product 
however  sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product 
we have established an allowance for returns based upon historical trends 
effects of new accounting pronouncements the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments eitf in november eitf provides guidance on other than temporary impairments and its application to debt and equity investments and applies to investments in debt and marketable securities that are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
eitf requires additional disclosure of investments with unrealized losses 
the requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and accordingly we have reflected those expanded disclosures in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits fas r in december sfas no 
r requires additional disclosure regarding certain aspects of pension plans including  but not limited to  asset and investment strategy  expected employer contributions and expected benefit payments 
the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for financial statements of periods ending after december  and accordingly we have reflected those expanded disclosures in note to our consolidated financial statements 
factors affecting our operating results our business is cyclical and is affected by industrial economic conditions  and over the past several years we experienced substantially reduced demand for our products 
many of the end users of our products are in highly cyclical industries  such as general manufacturing and construction  that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
their demand for our products  and thus our results of operations  is directly related to the level of production in their facilities  which changes as a result of changes in general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
since the fourth quarter of fiscal  for example  we experienced significantly reduced demand for our products  generally as a result of the global economic slowdown  and more specifically as a result of the dramatic decline in capital goods spending in the industries in which our end users operate 
these lower levels of demand resulted in a decline in net sales from fiscal to fiscal  from approximately million to approximately million 
this decline in net sales resulted in a decline in our income from operations during the same period 
in addition  our fiscal annual price increase implementation  scheduled for december  was delayed for eight months due to weak economic conditions 
during fiscal  we began to see stabilization and modest improvement in sales and operating profitability in the latter half of the year 
if there is further deterioration in the general economy or in the industries we serve  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be further adversely affected 
in addition  the cyclical nature of our business could at times also adversely affect our liquidity and ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
if demand for our products deteriorates further  the cost saving efforts we have implemented may not be sufficient to achieve the benefits we expect 
in fiscal  we continued our facility rationalization and lean manufacturing programs in an ongoing effort to reduce our cost structure 
if the economy does not continue to improve or deteriorates further  our sales could continue to decline 
if sales are lower than our expectations  our cost saving programs may not achieve the benefits we expect 
we may be forced to take additional cost savings steps that could result in additional charges and materially affect our ability to compete or implement our business strategies 
we rely in large part on independent distributors for sales of our products 
we depend on independent distributors to sell our products and provide service and aftermarket support to our customers 
distributors play a significant role in determining which of our products are stocked at the branch locations  and hence are most readily accessible to aftermarket buyers  and the price at which these products are sold 
almost all of the distributors with whom we transact business offer competitive products and services to our customers 
we do not have written agreements with our distributors located in the united states 
the loss of a substantial number of these distributors or an increase in the distributors sales of our competitors products to our ultimate customers could materially reduce our sales and profits 
we are subject to currency fluctuations from our international sales 
our products are sold in many countries around the world 
thus  a portion of our revenues approximately million in fiscal year is generated in foreign currencies  including principally the euro and the canadian dollar  while a portion of the costs incurred to generate those revenues are incurred in other currencies 
since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had  and will continue to have  an impact on our earnings 
we currently do not have exchange rate hedges in place to reduce the risk of an adverse currency exchange movement 
currency fluctuations may impact our financial performance in the future 
our international operations pose certain risks that may adversely impact sales and earnings 
we have operations and assets located outside of the united states  primarily in canada  mexico  germany  the united kingdom  denmark  france and china 
in addition  we import a portion of our hoist product line from china and japan  and sell our products to distributors located in approximately countries 
in fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were derived from non us markets 
these international operations are subject to a number of special risks  in addition to the risks of our domestic business  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  differing protections of intellectual property  trade barriers  labor unrest  exchange controls  regional economic uncertainty  differing and possibly more stringent labor regulation  risk of governmental expropriation  domestic and foreign customs and tariffs  current and changing regulatory environments  difficulty in obtaining distribution support  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differences in the availability and terms of financing  political instability and risks of increases in taxes 
also  in some foreign jurisdictions we may be subject to laws limiting the right and ability of entities organized or operating therein to pay dividends or remit earnings to affiliated companies unless specified conditions are met 
these factors may adversely affect our future profits 
part of our strategy is to expand our worldwide market share and reduce costs by strengthening our international distribution capabilities and sourcing basic components in foreign countries  in particular in mexico and china 
implementation of this strategy may increase the impact of the risks described above  and we cannot assure you that such risks will not have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is highly competitive and increased competition could reduce our sales  earnings and profitability 
the principal markets that we serve within the material handling industry are fragmented and highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on performance  functionality  price  brand recognition  customer service and support  and product availability 
our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes  some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us  which could reduce our gross margins and net income 
the greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions 
certain competitors may also have the ability to develop product or service innovations that could put us at a disadvantage 
in addition  some of our competitors have achieved substantially more market penetration in certain of the markets in which we operate 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers of material handling equipment  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
there can also be no assurance that customers will continue to regard our products favorably  that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to customers  that we will be able to improve or maintain our profit margins on sales to our customers or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets 
improper use of our products involves risks of personal injury and property damage  which exposes us to potential liability 
our business exposes us to possible claims for personal injury or death and property damage resulting from the products that we sell 
we maintain insurance through a combination of self insurance retentions and excess insurance coverage 
we monitor claims and potential claims of which we become aware and establish accrued liability reserves for the self insurance amounts based on our liability estimates for such claims 
we cannot give any assurance that existing or future claims will not exceed our estimates for self insurance or the amount of our excess insurance coverage 
in addition  we cannot give any assurance that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or that our insurers would not require us to increase our self insurance amounts 
claims brought against us that are not covered by insurance or that result in recoveries in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results and financial condition 
our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in steel prices 
we may not be able to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers 
the principal raw material used in our specialty chain  forging and crane building operations is steel 
we utilize approximately million of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod  wire  bar  structural and others 
the steel industry as a whole is highly cyclical  and at times pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  labor costs  competition  import duties  tariffs and currency exchange rates 
recently  the market price of steel has increased significantly 
this volatility can significantly affect our raw material costs 
in an environment of increasing raw material prices  competitive conditions will determine how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers 
to the extent we are unable to pass on sufficient price increases to our customers  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we depend on our senior management team and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations 
our success is dependent on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel 
we are subject to various environmental laws which may require us to expend significant capital and incur substantial cost 
our operations and facilities are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign requirements relating to the protection of the environment  including those governing the discharges of pollutants in the air and water  the generation  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with such requirements 
violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws and regulations  or changes in such laws and regulations such as the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment  could result in substantial costs to us  including operating costs and capital expenditures  fines and civil and criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  clean up costs or costs relating to the temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations 
certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years  and we have remediated contamination at some of our facilities 
over time  we and other predecessor operators of such facilities have generated  used  handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes 
additional environmental liabilities could exist  including clean up obligations at these locations or other sites at which materials from our operations were disposed  which could result in substantial future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits or have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we could pursue selected divestitures which would impact future sales  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
our strategy is to exit businesses that i are not integrated  either operationally or through sales and marketing  with the rest of our company  ii have market channels and customers different from the business of our core products segment  iii are not designated as recipients of significant investment of corporate resources in the foreseeable future  or iv have had  and are expected to continue to have  low returns on our investment of financial and management resources 
for example  in fiscal  we sold our positech and lister chain forge businesses and in fiscal  we sold our asi and lico steel businesses after determining that they did not meet our criteria for continuing investment 
we periodically review our businesses and are currently evaluating strategic alternatives for certain of our businesses 
in the aggregate  these businesses generated fiscal sales and ebitda of million and million  respectively 
divestiture of some or all of such businesses would affect future sales  operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of our products 
we also evaluate our steel cost increases and assess the need for price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  approximately of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  china  denmark  the united kingdom  france and germany and sell our products and solutions in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies and the mexican peso 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in canadian dollars decreases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  a decline in the rate of exchange between the euro and the us dollar impacts net income by approximately million 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have not invested in derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency transactions 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we do not have any swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
at march  and  approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates  including the effect of an interest rate swap that was in place at march  at those dates  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates in fiscal and would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
like most industrial manufacturers  we are involved with asbestos related litigation 
in continually evaluating our estimated asbestos related liability we review  among other things  the incidence of past and recent claims  the historical case dismissal rate  the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs  our recent and historical resolution of the cases  the number of cases pending against us  the status and results of broad based settlement discussions and the number of years such activity might continue 
based on this review  we have estimated our share of the liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims 
this estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability 
we will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable 
our actuaries have estimated our asbestos related liability to range from million to million through approximately march  the estimate of our asbestos related liability that is probable and estimable through ranges from million as of march  the range of probable and estimable liability reflects uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims  which may be influenced by a number of factors  including the outcome of the ongoing broad based settlement negotiations  defensive strategies  and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad based settlement program 
we have concluded that no amount within that range is more likely than any other  and therefore we have reflected million as a liability in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation such as the fair act 
of this amount  we expect to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately million over the next months 
because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years  we believe that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after tax effect on the financial condition of the company or its liquidity  although the net after tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period
