results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of net sales represented by certain items in the company s statements of operations 
percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill and covenant amortization income from operations interest expense  net other income income before income taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle income taxes income before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   declined by million  or approximately  when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in is attributable to lower sales of commercial and industrial buildings  reflecting the general business decline in the non residential building sector and the overall economy 
lower sales were also impacted in the fourth quarter by the shift in marketing approach for non classroom sales as the company moved away from a reliance on a dealer network and focused more on direct sales for these products 
the company believes that the decline in sales associated with the shift to greater direct sales is temporary as the company develops the necessary sales network 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or approximately  when compared to the previous year 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit was due to several factors unplanned costs on certain projects were driven by the transition to more complex  multi story projects that accelerated during with these complex projects accounting for more than of the net revenue in  up significantly over the prior year  the company went through a significant learning curve  particularly for the site portion of the contracts 
the company believes that the experience gained in project management and actual execution on project sites positions the company well for and beyond 
unabsorbed fixed and semi variable costs associated with the decline in production during the fourth quarter contributed significantly to the decline in gross margin for fourth quarter sales of million were down million from the prior year fourth quarter 
the company believes that increased volumes projected for and a flattening of the historical sales cycle due to geographic and product offering expansions will minimize these unabsorbed costs going forward 
during the company closed three leased facilities  consolidating three facilities into one in florida and two facilities into one in arizona 
while these plant consolidations did drive incremental costs in  going forward  significant savings are anticipated due to increased efficiencies 
the lower margins of are not seen as establishing or continuing a trend 
the company expects higher margins associated with the reduced reliance on the dealer network as well as the improvements noted above 
in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million over the prior year with sg a costs representing of sales compared to of sales the prior year 
this increase was directly attributable to increased sales activities in the florida classroom market and to the shift to direct sales for non classroom sales throughout the company 
although sg a is expected to decline as a percent of sales from levels  the company believes the direct sales model will have higher sg a costs than the costs associated with using a dealer network 
however  direct sales margins are higher than sales to the dealer network and more than justify the increased sg a expense

income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for decreased by million  or  when compared to as a percentage of net sales  income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle decreased from in to in liquidity and capital resources to date  the company has funded its operations and capital expenditures with cash generated internally by operations  supplemented by borrowings under various credit facilities and public offerings 
during the years ended december   and  the company s operations provided cash in the amounts of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million 
the financial performance during the fourth quarter of resulted in the violation of certain bank covenants 
the company secured waivers for those covenant violations and amended its credit facility in march reflecting the reduction in long term debt and lower revolving fund requirements  the company now has a million bank credit facility which provides for a million revolving credit line 
the credit facility is secured by all the company s assets 
at december   million was outstanding under the revolving credit line 
the credit facility expires in december at which time the long term debt will be fully paid 
the company had working capital of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
in  current assets decreased by million  with a decrease of million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on contracts  a decrease in contracts receivable of million  and a decrease in inventories of million offset by an increase of million in due from affiliates  an increase of million in prepaid assets  an increase of million in cash  an increase of million in other current assets  and an increase of million in deferred tax assets

capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in all three years  the majority of expenditures were a result of expanding production capacity at the company s various facilities 
the company expects to expend approximately million in capital projects in management believes that the company s existing product lines and manufacturing capacity will enable the company to generate sufficient cash through operations  supplemented by the company s bank line of credit  to finance the company s business over the next twelve months 
however  additional cash resources may be required if the company s rate of growth exceeds currently anticipated levels 
moreover  it may prove necessary for the company to construct or acquire additional manufacturing facilities in order for the company to compete effectively in new market areas or states which are beyond a mile radius from one of its production facilities 
the construction or acquisition of new facilities could require significant additional capital 
for these reasons  among others  the company may need additional debt or equity financing in the future 
there can be  however  no assurance that the company will be successful in obtaining such additional financing  or that any such financing will be available on terms acceptable to it 
commitments and contingencies the following table represents a list of the company s contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by year amounts in thousands total thereafter long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations use of estimates and critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission sec requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions including those related the company s most critical accounting policies 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
changes in economic conditions could have an impact on these estimates and the company s actual results 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity allowances for contract adjustments the company maintains allowances for contract adjustments that result from the inability of its customers to make their required payments 
management bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable  by account  at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  and an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition on construction contracts contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
revenue recognized is that percentage of the total contract price that cost expended to date bears to anticipated final total cost  based on current estimates of costs to complete 
the percentage of completion methodology generally results in the recognition of reasonably consistent profit margins over the life of a contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
the resulting difference is recognized as unbilled or deferred revenue 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through corporate policy  approval and monitoring processes 
risks relating to project delivery  productivity and other factors are considered in the estimation process 
our estimates of revenues and costs on construction contracts change periodically in the normal course of business due to factors such as productivity and modifications of contractual arrangements 
such changes are reflected in the results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period the revisions are determined 
provisions for estimated losses are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
seasonality historically  the company s quarterly revenues have been highest in the second and third quarters of each calendar year because a large number of orders for modular classrooms placed by school districts require that classrooms be constructed  delivered and installed in time for the upcoming new school year which generally commences in september 
the company has typically been able to add employees as needed to respond to the corresponding increases in manufacturing output required by such seasonality to meet currently foreseeable increases in this seasonal demand 
the company s first and fourth quarter revenues are typically lower due to greater number of holidays and days of inclement weather during such periods 
in addition  the company s operating margins may vary on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of revenues between standardized classrooms and higher margin customized classrooms and the timing of the completion of large  higher margin customized contracts 
the company anticipates a smoothing of this seasonality due to the growing impact of multi year contracts and increased sales outside the traditional classroom market 
however  these factors will not fully offset the impact of inclement weather and concentrations of holidays 
so although the impact of seasonality is expected to be diminished  revenue and margins in the first and fourth quarters will likely be lower than in the second and third quarters 
inflation during the past three years  the company has not been adversely affected by inflation  because it has been generally able to pass along increases in the costs of labor and materials to its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
although the company is aggressively pursuing means of offsetting the impact  recent steel prices have increased significantly and gross margin may see some impact from these increases 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market factors such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or equity prices will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of instruments 
we are principally exposed to interest rate and credit risks 
we are not exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuation in interest rates on our million credit facility 
during  we did not use interest rate swaps or other types of derivative financial instruments 
the carrying value of the credit facility approximates fair value as the interest rate is variable and resets frequently 
indebtedness under the credit facility bears interest at libor plus additional interest of between and  or the federal funds rate plus additional interest of between to 
the additional interest charge is based upon certain financial ratios 
we estimate that the average amount of debt outstanding under the credit facility for will be million 
therefore  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense of  for the year 
credit risk we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to customers 
we actively monitor this risk through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
historically  credit losses have been small and within our expectations
