through quadramet investigational clinical data presented at a number of medical meetings in and broader follow up studies thereon planned in  we hope to set the stage for potential product expansion opportunities 
our prostascint collaborations signed in with general electric medical systems and siemens and an improved reimbursement climate should help to drive future sales for this product

prostascint 
prostascint sales were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from million for the same period of sales of prostascint accounted for and of product related revenues for and  respectively 
prostascint has historically been a challenging product for physicians and technologists to use  in part due to inherent limitations in nuclear medicine imaging 
while we believe that the period to period decrease in prostascint sales that we have experienced is due  to a large degree  to such challenge  we also believe that such decline in prostascint revenue may be reversed depending upon  among other things  the implementation and continued research relating to the following i advances in imaging technology  ii new product applications  and iii improvements in healthcare reimbursement practices 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully market prostascint or that prostascint will achieve greater market penetration on a timely basis or result in significant revenues for us

currently  we market quadramet only in the united states 
schering ag  germany  through its subsidiary cis bio international  will continue to market quadramet in europe as a direct licensee of dow chemical company 
we believe that the future growth and market penetration of quadramet is dependent upon  among other things i new clinical data supporting the expanded and earlier use of quadramet in various cancers  ii novel research supporting combination uses with other therapies  such as chemotherapeutics and bisphophonates  and iii establishing the use of quadramet at higher doses to target and treat primary bone cancers

table of contents we acquired an exclusive license from the dow chemical company for quadramet for the treatment of osteoblastic bone metastases in certain territories 
the agreement requires us to pay dow royalties based on a percentage of net sales of quadramet  or a guaranteed contractual minimum payment  whichever is greater  and future payment upon achievement of certain milestones 
future annual minimum royalties due to dow are million per year in through and  in our financial objectives are to meet our capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products and licensing arrangements 
to achieve these objectives  we may enter into research and development partnerships and acquire  in license and develop other technologies  products or services 
certain of these strategies may require payments by us in either cash or stock in addition to the costs associated with developing and marketing a product or technology 
however  we believe that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
there can be no assurance as to the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses  if ever 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  we may sell equity or debt securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to implement our planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further our marketing and sales programs 
we expect that our existing capital resources should be adequate to fund our operations and commitments at least into the middle of we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we expect that we will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when we reach profitability  for further product development costs  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including i the successful commercialization of our products  ii the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  iii progress in our product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  iv progress with clinical trials  v progress with regulatory affairs activities  vi the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  vii competing technological and market developments  and viii the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of our products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
there can be no assurance that the financial sources described above will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition product related revenues include product sales by cytogen to its customers and quadramet royalties 
product sales are recognized when products are shipped  which is when the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists and the sales price is fixed and determinable 
the company does not grant price protection to its customers 
prior to the reacquisition of quadramet from its marketing partner  berlex laboratories in august  the company recognized royalty revenue on quadramet sales made by berlex  during each period as berlex sold the product 
as a result of the reacquisition  effective august   the company began recognizing revenue from the sales of quadramet and no longer receives quadramet royalty revenue 
license and contract revenues include milestone payments and fees under collaborative agreements with third parties  revenues from research services  and revenues from other miscellaneous sources 
in  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab replaced staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  which the company adopted in the provisions related to non refundable  up front license fees were unchanged in sab compared to sab accordingly  we defer up front license fees and recognize them over the estimated performance period of the related agreement  when we have continuing involvement 
since the term of the performance periods is subject to management s estimates  future revenues to be recognized could be affected by changes in such estimates 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust our allowance for uncollectible accounts if the future bad debt expense exceeds our estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as a limited number of our customers provide a high percent of total revenues  and corresponding receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  as determined using the first in  first out method  which most closely reflects the physical flow of our inventories 
our products and raw materials are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly review quantities on hand to determine the need for reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product sales 
our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
carrying value of fixed and intangible assets our fixed assets and certain of our acquired rights to market our products have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of 
table of contents such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
adverse changes regarding future cash flows to be received from long lived assets could indicate that an impairment exists  and would require the write down of the carrying value of the impaired asset at that time 
recently enacted accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities vies  which addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
fin r replaces fasb interpretation no 
 which was issued in january we are required to apply fin r to variable interests in vies created after december  for variable interests in vies created before january   the interpretation will be applied beginning on march  for any vies that must be consolidated under fin r that were created before january   the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests of the vie initially would be measured at their carrying amounts with any difference between the net amount added to the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
if determining the carrying amounts is not practicable  fair value at the date fin r first applies may be used to measure the assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the vie 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of fin r will have on our consolidated financial statements 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  was issued in may this statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement also includes required disclosures for financial instruments within its scope 
for us  the statement was effective for instruments entered into or modified after may  for certain mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  the statement will be effective for us at a later date 
we currently do not have any financial instruments that are within the scope of this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
as of december   the company had million of debt outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates  as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
however  downward changes in interest rates could expose us to market risk associated with any fixed interest rate debt
