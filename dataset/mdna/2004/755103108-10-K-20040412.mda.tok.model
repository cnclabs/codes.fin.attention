executive summary the company manufactures and distributes engineered products for heat resistant  inertia control  energy absorption and transmission applications 
the company s operations are categorized into three business segments wet friction  dry friction and aftermarket 
the wet friction segment manufactures and distributes automatic transmission and wet wheel brake system components to oems in north america  europe and asia 
it is the largest segment and represents of total net sales and all of the recorded losses for the dry friction segment manufactures and distributes manual transmission clutch facings in europe and asia to system assemblers who sell manual transmission systems to oems and the aftermarket 
this segment represents of total net sales 
the aftermarket segment manufactures and sources automatic transmission parts  which are sold predominantly to warehouse distributors who sell the product domestically and to international customers 
approximately million of sales in represented parts manufactured by the wet friction segment  which were sold through the aftermarket segment 
the aftermarket segment represents of total net sales 
additional information on these business segments is presented in note h segment reporting in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
an executive summary of significant events is presented below  as well as a tabular presentation of the effects on the company s financial results 
the issues and events are more fully explained in the management s discussion and analysis  subsequent to this executive summary 
raytech corporation recorded a million loss for the year ended december  the loss is due to certain events that occurred during the fiscal year 
it should be noted that in determining the value of goodwill and other intangible assets at the time the company emerged from bankruptcy  the projected performance in terms of future cash flows by business segment was used to determine the values 
the valuation distribution was as follows wet friction aftermarket total technology    distribution base   trademarks    goodwill    there were no goodwill or intangible values attributed to the dry friction segment 
in addition to the goodwill and other intangibles  the company increased the book value of certain long lived tangible assets to fair market value in accordance with statement of position sop 
the increased values the step up attributable to the long lived assets were distributed as follows wet friction segment  aftermarket segment  total long lived tangible assets step up  there was no step up in value attributed to the dry friction segment 
at emergence from bankruptcy  it was determined that  in order to maintain segment performance comparability  the increased asset values associated with the recording of the goodwill and other intangibles and the step up for the long lived tangible assets would be maintained at a corporate level 
segment reporting is discussed in note h of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  although the underlying financial analysis for the impairment charges was determined using the financial projections for wet friction and aftermarket  the majority of the charges were recorded at the corporate level 
the million charge recorded in the wet friction segment represents assets held in that grouping 
the performance of the wet friction segment was materially impacted by lower sales volume of million and reduced pricing on certain of its continuing sales 
the operating loss recorded by the segment for fiscal year of million compares to an operating profit of million for the year ended  a change period over period of million 
the operating loss in included an impairment charge of million 
the company  based on the deteriorating performance of the wet friction segment  among other factors  developed projected financial information  which provided a longer term view of expected financial performance 
the company s previous long range plan was developed in during a much stronger economic environment 
the plan developed in served as the basis for the application of the fresh start accounting 
the results of the new financial plan showed substantially reduced projected sales and profitability compared to the previous plan 
the company used the services of an independent consulting firm to develop valuation models based on the financial projections 
using the new financial projections  the company a 
reviewed its recorded goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the results of the evaluation determined that an impairment existed and a writeoff of goodwill and other intangibles was appropriate 
an impairment charge of million was recorded 
b 
in conjunction with the analysis noted above  the company also evaluated its long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this review determined that million of certain long lived assets was impaired and were written off 
the company  in conjunction with the original recording of the deferred tax asset recorded a payable to the raytech personal injury trust the pi trust in accordance with a tax agreement established as an element of the chapter agreement 
the company  in reviewing the financial plan noted above  determined that collectibility of certain deferred tax assets recorded on the company s books was in question 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
based on the determination that a valuation allowance was needed against the deferred tax assets  the company reduced the non current payable to the pi trust million  which created million of other income 
in addition  the company recorded an increase of million to the current payable to the pi trust to reflect the impact of certain state taxes 
this resulted in a reduction of million to other income 
the net effect of these entries was the recording of million in other income in conjunction with a reduction of the payable to the pi trust 
the company then determined the impact of all the adjustments relating to the reduction in the deferred tax assets and recorded a tax provision of million 
a reconciliation of the loss from operations multiplied by the statutory federal tax rate to the reported tax provision is summarized in note i in the consolidated financial statements 
in the quarter ended june   the company recorded a million charge for costs incurred in compliance with the epa removal order 
in the quarter ended september   the company recorded an additional million for certain additional remediation costs  fines and investigation costs 
these costs are more fully explained below and in note g to the consolidated financial statements 
the total impact of the above was a million charge to operations in the impact of the above issues on reported financial results is set forth in the table below

risk factors the company s businesses are subject to certain risks  including but not limited to those described below  that could cause material changes in its results of operations or financial condition in the future 
the company s businesses are greatly affected by general economic conditions 
the company sells components to the automotive and heavy duty equipment industries and in large part is dependent upon consumer demand for automobiles  consumer confidence and business investment in heavy equipment 
the company s businesses sell components for transmissions and brakes to automotive and heavy duty oems as well as the automotive aftermarket 
the economic slowdown and recession of the last three years have resulted in reduced heavy equipment and passenger vehicle production in the united states and in foreign markets and reduced demand in the aftermarket 
it is possible that oem vehicle and equipment production will not increase significantly in and future years 
continuation of the economic slowdown may adversely affect the company s revenues in all of its business segments 
the company s customers are large companies under pressure to cut component costs 
the wet friction segment s largest customers are experiencing margin erosion due to reduced volume  high labor costs and intense foreign competition 
the company is a relatively small supplier of a limited number of components 
due to their size  the company s customers are often able to demand component price reductions from their suppliers  including all segments of the company 
these customers may also demand technological changes and quality improvements at the company s expense 
in addition  the trend in the automotive aftermarket is toward longer transmission service and replacement cycles due to improved quality 
if foreign automotive manufacturers continue to take us market share from the company s domestic oem customers and economic conditions do not improve significantly  the company s revenues will continue to be adversely affected by these factors 
the company is subject to substantial environmental remediation obligations for past contamination that are not yet fixed in scope or amount 
the nature of environmental contamination and its remediation are such that the amount and nature of work necessary is often unknown until late in the process 
the level of responsibility of the parties involved and the level of remediation to be required by governmental authorities is also uncertain 
the company also incurs substantial ongoing environmental compliance costs in operating its production facilities 
substantial unanticipated environmental costs could adversely affect profitability 
see environmental claims below and note g to the consolidated financial statements 
raytech s common stock is currently included in the russell equity index 
the russell is a market capitalization weighted index of the  largest us companies 
russell reconstitutes the index annually in order to accurately rank the  largest companies in the us stock market by market capitalization to provide a truer reflection of stock market activity and performance 
there is a risk that raytech may no longer be part of that index after the next recalculation of the index in june if raytech ceases to be a member of the russell  its common stock price may be adversely affected because mutual funds and other investors who must own or wish to own the russell index will sell or no longer purchase raytech common stock 
the pi trust holds and the epa holds of the outstanding common stock of the company at december  in  worldwide increases in steel demand have led to increased prices and concerns of a steel shortage 
potential impacts on the company from the current steel market conditions could include reduced delivery levels of finished products to raybestos customers and lower profitability due to higher raw material costs 
significant accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are detailed in note a in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of raytech corporation and its subsidiaries 
the investment by third parties in allomatic products company apc is accounted for as minority interest in the consolidated financial statements 
there are no unconsolidated entities 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported revenue and expenses made in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include inventory  receivable and environmental reserves  depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  the accruals for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits  and the recoverable value of deferred tax assets and the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the most significant areas involving management s judgment are described below 
accruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated or if an amount is likely to fall within a range and no amount within the range can be determined to be the better estimate  the minimum amount of the range is recorded 
remediation obligations are not recorded on a discounted basis 
reimbursements from insurance carriers relating to environmental matters are not recorded until it is probable that such recoveries will be realized 
the accrual for environmental matters is discussed in this management discussion and analysis under the heading provision for environmental remediation 
pension benefits and welfare benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the court ordered that raytech was liable for the maintenance and funding of the underfunded pension plan obligations of raymark corporation 
raytech  based on the court s order  assumed the role of plan sponsor of the raymark plans upon the emergence from bankruptcy in the fall of because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments  significant estimates are required to calculate pension and welfare benefit expenses and liabilities related to the company s plans 
the company utilizes the services of independent actuaries  whose models are used to facilitate these calculations 
several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and welfare benefit expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements 
management believes the three most significant variables in the pension models are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate  and the expected rate of compensation increase 
management believes the most significant assumption in the welfare benefit model is the healthcare cost trend rate 
the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors  including employee turnover  retirement age  and mortality 
company management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which we operate 
the company provides certain warranties relating to the quality and performance of its products 
the primary product of the company  friction plates  is used in manual and automatic transmissions  transfer cases and wet wheel brake systems for heavy duty equipment 
the company maintains product liability insurance that covers personal injuries and property damage alleged to have been caused by defective products 
the company also has insurance to cover the costs of product recalls arising from its german and chinese operations 
however  the company currently carries only limited insurance for product recall costs in the united states  and none in the uk  as management believes such insurance to be cost prohibitive given the company s warranty experience 
warranty claims have historically been insignificant due to the quality of the company s products and the impact of other potential parts interactions in these systems  which may contribute to the root cause of any system failure 
the costs in for product warranty support have been de minimis 
some sales contracts with customers provide that the company will indemnify the customer and its affiliates against certain specified patent  copyright and trade secret infringement claims of third parties that are based on the use or sale of the company components 
there have been no significant claims to date 
at december   the company had goodwill and other intangibles of million  which were recorded as a result of the fresh start accounting process in management reviews goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that its value may have declined 
the unpatented technology and distribution base are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
in order to evaluate impairment  assumptions about the future condition and operations of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates are made 
using these assumptions  management determines  with the assistance of other professionals  whether an impairment charge is required to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets to its estimated fair value 
in the case of long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets  if the undiscounted future cash flows related to the long lived assets are less than the assets carrying value  a similar impairment charge would be recorded 
management believes that the assumptions made to evaluate goodwill  other intangibles and tangible long lived assets impairment are appropriate and reasonable 
the assessment of the amount of the company s deferred tax assets  which will be realizable  requires the use of significant judgments and estimates 
in making its assessment  the company evaluates all relevant evidence  including current industry dynamics within which the company operates  to determine if it would be able to realize all or a part of its deferred tax assets in the future 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize certain of its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be recorded in the period such a determination is made 
historical information and methods of presentation the company  at december   completed its second full year of operation as the successor company post emergence from bankruptcy 
in april  raytech emerged from the protection of bankruptcy court under chapter of title of the united states bankruptcy code 
raytech had been under the chapter protection since march the bankruptcy history and emergence are described in more detail in note v to the consolidated financial statements 
as of april   the company adopted fresh start reporting pursuant to the guidance provided by the american institute of certified public accountant s sop no 
 financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code 
the effective date of the company s emergence from bankruptcy was considered to be the close of business on april  for financial reporting purposes 
the periods presented prior to april  have been designated predecessor company and the periods subsequent to april  have been designated successor company 
in accordance with fresh start reporting  all assets and liabilities were recorded at their respective fair values 
the fair value of substantially all of the company s long lived assets was determined using information provided by third party appraisers 
the company has determined that the most meaningful presentation of financial information would be to provide comparative analysis of the financial performance of the successor company for the fiscal years ended december  and december  and for the thirty nine week periods ended december and december  additionally  the financial analysis detailed below provides a comparative analysis of the financial performance of the successor company for the period december  through march  compared to the predecessor company financial performance for the period january  through april  the adjustments relating to the recording of reorganization expenses and other fresh start adjustments for the one day period ended april  are detailed in note w to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has elected not to present a comparative analysis of the fifty two week period ended december  since such information in the prior period would require consolidating statements of the predecessor company and the successor company 
it was determined that the significance of the adjustments relating to the emergence from bankruptcy would render such an analysis not meaningful 
successor company discussion and analysis for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales worldwide net sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the prior year  a decline of million 
the decline in sales reflects a decrease in the wet friction segment of million and a decrease in the aftermarket segment of million offset by a million increase in the dry friction segment 
the remaining change is due to lower intercompany sales from wet friction to aftermarket  which are eliminated in consolidation 
the detailed discussion of the individual segment performance is presented in business segment and geographic area results 
gross profit the gross profit for the fiscal year of million compares to the gross profit of million for fiscal  a decline in gross profit of million or 
the gross profit percentage for of compares to the gross profit percentage for of 
the decline in gross profit is due entirely to the reduced gross profit in the wet friction segment of million  which was partially offset by increased gross margin in the dry friction segment of million 
the gross profit analysis by business segment is presented in business segment and geographic area results 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year of million compares to million for the fiscal year  an increase of million or 
the increased costs were due to certain severance and new hire costs in the wet friction segment of 
million 
in addition  the dry friction segment increased sg a million in support of the million in increased sales volume 
the aftermarket increased 
million due to primarily providing for certain accounts receivable reserves in the above increases were offset by 
million in reduced corporate costs 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year of million compares to interest expense of 
million for the year 
the increased interest expense of 
million reflects the increased borrowings year over year 
other income the company recorded other income of million for fiscal compared to 
million for fiscal  an increase in other income of million 
the other income component was significantly affected by the reduction of certain net deferred tax assets and the corresponding payable to the pi trust  which generated other income in the payable to the pi trust was reduced million due to the reduction of certain deferred tax assets  which are more fully explained in note i of the consolidated financial statements and within this management s discussion and analysis 
in addition  the company recorded million of other expense during fiscal  which relates more closely to the 
million of other income recorded in fiscal the change year over year related to the disposal of certain property  plant and equipment in dry friction and wet friction 
provision for environmental remediation the company recorded a provision in the second quarter of of million for expected final remediation and administrative cost associated with compliance with the epa removal  which is discussed in note g litigation of the consolidated financial statements 
the work required under the epa removal order has been completed at this time and a final report  which documents the compliance actions  has been accepted by the epa 
during the thirteen week period ended june   the cost of contaminated soil removal increased over the previously accrued amount by million due to changes in the tonnage required to be removed in order to comply with the epa removal order compared to the estimate 
in addition  the epa has estimated the administrative charge for the agency s oversight of the execution of the epa removal order will be approximately 
million 
also  during the second quarter  the company settled a disputed billing amount  which arose in the first stage of the project from the construction company hired to do the initial cleanup 
the resolution of the dispute resulted in a reduction of 
million of amounts previously recorded by the company 
the construction company was replaced prior to the completion of the first stage 
although the company has  to the best of its knowledge  complied fully with the epa removal order  there exists the potential for additional remediation 
further  the company may be required to remediate additional contiguous parcels of property not subject to the epa removal order  subject to potential future actions taken by the epa 
the company has recorded a provision in the third quarter of of million as its current estimate of the potential cost to remediate the additional contiguous parcels of property not subject to the epa removal order as noted above 
the estimate of cost noted above is based on preliminary engineering data at a level of compliance similar to the requirements contained in the epa removal order 
the company is currently negotiating a settlement with the epa for future remediation on this site 
the outcome of the negotiation could also impact the estimated cost noted above 
on may   the epa issued a pre filing notice and opportunity to confer to rpc 
this notice stated that epa is contemplating filing a civil action against rpc for violations of various environmental statutes and is offering rpc the opportunity to participate in pre filing negotiations to resolve this matter before initiation of litigation 
the epa stated that it has reason to believe that rpc committed violations of the clean air act  clean water act  resource conservation and recovery act  and toxic substances control act and that rpc could be subject to substantial penalty 
the company had previously recorded a 
million provision for settlement of these violations 
by letter dated september   the epa stated that penalties for violations alleged in the pre filing notice could total approximately million and suggested that the parties resolve the pre filing notice claims as follows rpc should pay approximately million and undertake compliance activities  onsite investigative work that the epa estimated would cost approximately million  and corrective action to resolve the pre filing notice  with no estimate of such cost of corrective action 
the company recorded a provision in the third quarter of for million based on the notice 
the idem conducted a site review in may at the crawfordsville  indiana  facility of rpc 
in july  the idem sent rpc a report of such inspection 
this report stated that idem believes that rpc has violated certain environmental law requirements 
the idem report stated that the agency intends to notify enforcement authorities but did not specify any fines for the alleged violations 
in november  the company received a notice of violation and proposed agreed order relating to the may inspection 
subsequent to year end the company settled the order for thousand 
in  the company recorded a charge of million for compliance with the epa removal order discussed above  which increased the accrued liability at year end to million 
the accrued liability at year end is million 
see note g litigation for a full discussion of the above 
business segment and geographic area results the following discussion of operating results by industry segment and geographic area related to information contained in note h in the consolidated financial statements 
operating profit is income before income taxes and minority interest 
wet friction segment net sales   gross profit   operating profit loss   the segment recorded a decline in sales for fiscal of million compared to fiscal the decline in sales is due to lower sales to the automotive oem component of the segment of million due to lower demand for the company s product and reduced pricing 
the domestic automotive manufacturers  who represent the oem customers of the company  continue to lose market share to foreign competition  and the reduced demand for the domestic product directly impacts raytech 
a significant portion of the lost north american market share has been consumed by asian automakers  a market raytech has not penetrated 
in addition  sales to the heavy duty component of the segment declined million compared to fiscal results 
the decline represents certain part sales lost to competition as well as price reductions 
also  sales through the european component of this segment declined million compared to sales recorded in the fiscal year 
the sales decline reflects the decision by management in late to eliminate a non core business product line produced at the united kingdom facility 
the additional sales shortfall reflects reduced demand for product 
the segment recorded a decline in gross profit of million compared to fiscal results 
the gross profit margin for of compares to a gross profit margin of  a decline of percentage points 
the decline in gross profit reflects the impact of lower sales and reduced pricing 
the lack of gross profit in this segment was the driving force in the losses sustained by the company in in addition to the impact of the reduced gross profit  the segment recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal the charge reflects the reduction in the book value of certain long lived assets in accordance with the guidelines set forth in sfas see note d property  plant and equipment of the consolidated financial statements 
the segment also recorded certain charges relating to the net realizable value of inventory and other charges relating to losses  which will be incurred when certain products are produced and sold 
the provision we recorded for was million 
the company produces goods for its customers based on a purchase order system  and in certain instances using longer term contracts that stipulate a fixed selling price with no commitment as to quantity 
in instances where the product s cost exceeds the selling price  a reserve is established for the expected loss on goods in inventory and customer purchase orders received by the balance sheet date 
the company has not recorded an estimate of the loss over the term of these contracts since the quantity and mix of parts is not known and the future production costs will be impacted by  among other things  changes in economic conditions and management s actions  including expected cost savings initiatives 
the operating loss for the fiscal year reflects the loss from operations of million and the impairment charge of million for an operating loss of million 
the segment had operating profit in fiscal of million  a decline year over year of million 
the company is reviewing alternatives to improve the operating results for this segment 
alternatives being discussed include creating a stronger focus on european wet friction operations by transferring the management responsibility for this component to the dry friction management group  which is headquartered in germany 
subsequent to year end  the company transferred the responsibility for the european wet friction group to the dry friction management group 
in  the results will be reported in that segment 
conducting a facilities utilization review to determine if improved performance can be obtained through consolidating certain facilities with a focus on improved overhead absorption 
additionally  the company has identified in excess of million of cost savings projects it will implement in reviewing the need for separate research and development facilities and the potential to reduce costs while maintaining raytech technological capabilities 
subsequent to year end  the technical facility staff was reduced  and the sales staff is relocating to rented office space 
the automotive oem research and development efforts will be supported at the crawfordsville facility 
it is anticipated that the cost savings inherent in this consolidation will approximate 
million 
these and other items will be explored by management in order to improve on fiscal results 
aftermarket segment net sales   gross profit   operating profit   this segment experienced a reduction in net sales of million or in fiscal compared to the year 
the sales reduction reflects the lower demand for the company s products due to long lived parts in the oem product due primarily to improved quality 
in addition  the segment produces assembled kits for transmission rebuilding 
kit sales in were million lower than the year sales 
the gross profit declined 
million or in the year compared to the gross profit percentage for of compared to in the year 
the decrease in gross profit is due to the decrease in sales volume 
the segment was able to maintain its gross profit percentage  in spite of the lower sales 
the operating profit declined 
million in fiscal compared to the decrease in operating profit is due to the decrease in gross profit and a 
million increase in sg a expense 
the increase in sg a expense is due to an additional provision for accounts receivable reserves 
the segment includes apc  which is owned by the company  owned by raymark  a related party  and owned by certain employees of the company 
net sales for apc were million in and million in operating profit for apc was million in and million in apc is consolidated in the financial results and a minority interest is recorded to reflect the minority shareholders interest in apc 
a minority interest charge is recorded for the minority s percent of income 
dry friction net sales   gross profit   operating profit   the segment reported an increase in net sales of million or for fiscal compared to the year 
the sales increase reflects an increase in sales from the european dry friction component of this segment of million and an increase of million through the asian component of the segment 
the european increase reflects a volume increase of million and an increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation of million 
the increase in the sales through the asian operation are all volume related as the operation  which is in china  is not impacted by translation since the currency is fixed relative to the us dollar 
the sales growth reflects increased market share as the company s technology and competitive pricing continues to provide growth in this segment 
the gross profit improved million or in fiscal compared to the year 
the gross profit percentage for fiscal of compares to  an increase of percentage points 
the increase both in dollars and gross margin percent reflects the strong gross profit being realized in the asian operation of combined with the gross profit being realized in the european operation of 
the asian facility continues to grow as demand in china and other countries served by the facility continues to provide sales opportunities 
the operating profit increased 
million or providing an operating profit percentage of compared to an operating profit percentage of  an increase of 
percentage points 
this segment represents substantial growth and profitability opportunities for the company as the product technology and production methods continue to improve 
corporate the company does not distribute the costs of operating the corporate headquarters and certain other costs  which it maintains in its corporate group 
in april  the date the company emerged from the chapter proceedings  it determined that the increased property  plant and equipment value and the increase in recorded goodwill and other intangibles determined as part of the requirement of sop would be maintained at the corporate level 
it was determined that this would provide historical comparability at the operating segment level 
therefore  certain charges related to the impairments  more fully described in notes d and e of the consolidated financial statements were recorded as expense in the corporate group as opposed to the operating segments 
in reviewing the impact of the corporate group on segment results  the following should be noted the operating loss of million recorded as corporate expenses includes the following in millions impairment charge depreciation and amortization environmental cost corporate headquarters cost reduction of payable to pi trust other income note the other income is due to the reduction in the payable to the pi trust payable due to the adjustment to deferred assets 
see the other income discussion previous in this management s discussion and analysis 
liquidity  capital resources and future liquidity the company recorded a net loss for the year ended december  of million 
the impact on liquidity as measured by the net cash provided by operating activities reflects a positive cash flow of million 
the impact can be summarized as follows in millions net loss non cash charges depreciation and amortization impairment charges other working capital total non cash charges net cash provided by operating activities the non cash charges relating to the impairment are detailed in note d and note e to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal were million 
the decline in cash flows from operating activities year over year is million 
the decline in cash flow reflects the losses recorded in the business due to the poor performance of the wet friction segment 
the company s cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
capital expenditures for fiscal totaled million compared to million for the fiscal year 
in both years  the capital expenditures were comparable to planned spending amounts 
changes in the components of working capital for fiscal provided increased cash flow from reduced accounts receivable of million  income tax receivable of million and inventories million 
other current assets  including restricted cash  required the use of cash of million and accounts payable of 
million 
the reduction in the payable to the pi trust of million represents a non cash reduction in the liability  which is explained in note i to the consolidated financial statements and within this management s discussion and analysis 
the total borrowings at year end of million compares to total borrowings of million at year end  an increase of million period over period 
the available lines of credit at december  of million compares to million at year end  an increase in availability of million 
full details of the company s debt are contained in note f debt to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  refer to note n commitments to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure of future obligations and commitments 
in connection with the recorded loss of million  the company requested and obtained a waiver of the material adverse change clauses contained in the domestic bank agreements 
in summary of the above  the cash and available lines of credit at december  were million compared to million at year end  a decrease in cash and available lines of credit of million 
items which will potentially require cash payments in other than normal operating expenses include the following 
the company has recorded an accrued liability of million for certain environmental matters more fully discussed in this section of the form k and in note g to the consolidated financial statements 
it is not certain at this time when these funds will be expended 
there exists the potential that all or a portion of the funds will be spent in the company assumed the liability for the raymark pension plans as part of the chapter reorganization 
the plans  which are discussed as part of note m to the consolidated financial statements are under funded and the company  through an agreement with the internal revenue service  is providing both current contributions and catch up contributions for prior year funding deficiencies 
the expected funding for the plans in will be approximately million 
the funding in fiscal was million 
certain tax issues are discussed in note i to the consolidated financial statements  which provides detail concerning the status of the current internal revenue service audit and the use of certain future tax benefits 
management believes that existing cash balances  the company s lending facilities and cash flow from operations during will be sufficient to meet all of the company s obligations arising in the normal course of business  including anticipated capital investments 
however  the ability of the company to utilize its lending facilities is dependent on the company s ability to meet its financial forecasts for  which is not assured  and to meet the financial covenants contained in its credit facilities 
these forecasts include certain revenue assumptions generally consistent with the prior year for the wet friction on a comparable basis and aftermarket segments and modest growth in the dry friction segment  as well as certain cost saving initiatives 
if the company does not comply with the financial covenants  an event of default would occur and could result in the acceleration of the company s indebtedness under its domestic credit facilities 
if that were to occur  the ability of the company to continue would be dependent upon  among other things  its ability to amend the credit facilities  enact certain actions to generate cash and or to seek additional alternative financing from other lenders 
contractual obligations securities and exchange commission regulations require that we present our contractual obligations  and we have done so in the table that follows 
however  our future cash flow prospects cannot reasonably be assessed based on such obligations 
the most significant factor affecting our future cash flows is our ability to earn and collect cash from customers 
future cash outflows  whether they are contractual obligations or not  will vary based on our future needs 
while some such outflows are completely fixed for example  commitments to repay principal and interest on fixed rate borrowings most depend on future events for example  supply agreements to purchase commodity raw materials at quantities to be determined in the future at then market prices 
further  normal operations involve significant expenditures that are not based on commitments  for example  expenditures for income taxes or for payroll
