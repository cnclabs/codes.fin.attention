executive overview the company s operations cpi corp 
is a long standing leader  based on sittings and related revenues  in the professional portrait photography of young children and families 
from the single studio opened by its predecessor company in  we have grown to  studios throughout the united states  canada and puerto rico under license agreements with sears 
we have provided professional portrait photography for sears customers since and have been the exclusive sears portrait studio operator since as of the end of the last three fiscal years  the company s sears portrait studio counts were united states and puerto rico within full line sears stores locations not within sears stores canada total    in early  we commenced operations of our mexican portrait studio business and our mobile photography division initially offering mobile photography services principally to child care centers 
these new businesses were launched as part of the company s growth strategy announced in june designed to diversify our revenue sources and reduce our total dependence on sears 
we opened mexican portrait studios and entered mobile photography metropolitan markets throughout the united states 
most of the new mexican studios and mobile photography markets were opened during the second half of accordingly  revenues related to these new ventures were minimal  approximately  and million for mexico and mobile photography  respectively 
however  costs were incurred throughout to establish these new operations resulting in significant operating dilution of our overall consolidated results 
losses  net of associated tax benefits  for mexico and mobile photography operations in were  and million  respectively 
while both operations produced results worse than what was initially planned  the results of the mobile photography operation were substantially off plan  driven principally by our inability to operationally and systems wise support the accelerated expansion into markets in the first year of operations 
this resulted in higher costs and lower sales due to customer delivery and satisfaction issues 
page competitive factors trends challenges during the last several years  we have experienced a continuation of the increasing competition that began in the mass market professional studio industry in the early to mid s 
this increased competition was marked by an increase in the number of permanent studios in the united states from approximately  in to approximately  at the end of our fiscal year 
during the same time period  the number of our sears portrait studios has increased slightly from to in addition  in recent years a significant portion of the growth in industry studio count has been in non mall based formats  which has been a preference to the consumer over the mall based format  which accounts for a substantial portion of our studios 
this increased number of competitive locations  coupled in part with a relatively flat us birthrate and a general lack of perceived differentiation of product or service by consumers  has resulted in intense price competition as competitors attempt to protect or gain market share through aggressive pricing strategies 
in addition  we believe that the continued proliferation of amateur digital photography may be starting to negatively impact the frequency of portrait studio visits 
the competitive and other external factors cited above  coupled with the likely less than optimal experience that certain of our customers have experienced over the past several years due to ongoing technology and support challenges caused by an aging studio infrastructure  have resulted in a declining sittings trend in our sears portrait studios 
our sittings have declined from million in to million in although a portion of the sittings decline has been offset by increases in our average customer sales  overall net sales over the same time period have declined from million in to million in overall  the company s operating results for reflect the challenging  competitive sales environment of the mass market portrait photography industry  the internal challenges faced by the company  and related customer impact  in addressing its ongoing technology and support challenges caused by our aging studio infrastructure  and the significant operating dilution attributable to the company s new mexican and mobile photography operations in on march   the knightspoint group successfully completed their consent solicitation resulting in  among other things  the replacement of all but two of the company s then existing directors with the slate proposed by the knightspoint group 
accordingly  the company s new board is in the process of conducting their review of all relevant information related to the company s strategy going forward 
upon completion of this review  it is likely that certain previously announced strategies  or tactics for achievement of those strategies  may change 
pending completion of this review process  our new strategies  which are intended to return the company to a more profitable growth path and enhance shareholder value  are expected to include the following measures all of which are contained within the knightspoint group s definitive consent solicitation filed with the sec on january  implementing new executive compensation policies that align the interests of the board of directors and management with those of the company s stockholders  reducing corporate overhead by decreasing headquarters and administrative headcount and seeking to enhance studio productivity and efficiency by  for example  formulating new operating systems that reduce burdens on studio employees and consequently enable a greater focus on the customer which could lead to higher sales revenue  exploring ways to reduce and redirect advertising spending to seek to decrease the cost of customer acquisition  page formulating new merchandising and marketing strategies directed at addressing recent declines in sittings volume  increasing the average sale  and enhancing utilization of existing studios  including exploiting potential cross selling opportunities  sharpening focus on the core sears portrait studio business and  particularly  on the deployment of emerging digital technologies and applications  seeking to control capital spending by  among other things  establishing new return hurdle rates and deploying digital technologies judiciously while harvesting past investments  establishing new processes and procedures for testing and evaluating all significant programs and technologies prior to full development in an effort to manage any associated execution risk by the term execution risk  we mean the risk that in their implementation certain new initiatives may fail  significantly overrun budgeted costs or disrupt existing operations  exploring ways to enhance internal communication and implementing target gain sharing and other incentive programs across all levels of the organization in order to seek to speed decision making  address the needs of field personnel as they arise  and strengthen the alignment of interests between employees and shareholders  and discharging substantial cash to shareholders through large scale stock buybacks and or a special distribution

among the external factors are the impacts of continuing competitive pressures  including the opening of new competitor locations and severe competitor discounting  especially at the beginning of the holiday season 
in addition  the overall decline was exacerbated by the negative impacts of the inclement weather experienced in february and march in a large portion of the country

internal factors potentially negatively impacting sittings include the company s decision to substantially reduce television advertising and studio employment costs in the second half and fourth quarter of in response to weaker than anticipated sales performance during the first three quarters of in addition  it is likely that some customers visiting our studios are receiving a less than optimal experience as a result of ongoing technology and support challenges caused by our aging studio infrastructure 
the decrease in sittings between and was principally attributable to an increase in the number of competitor locations and the effects of competitors with lower priced package offers  coupled with a soft economic environment in driven by declining consumer confidence

the increase in average sales per customer between and was primarily attributable to a continued mix shift toward the higher value custom sittings as the decline in package sittings accounted for a substantial portion of the reported decline in overall sittings  an increase in the percentage of sales related to the march rollout of digitally enhanced products and the company s decision late in the second quarter of to begin selling custom proof sheets which had previously been provided free of charge as part of the custom offer

this reversal related to the favorable renegotiation of the company s supply contract with a vendor 
in addition  in the fourth page quarter of  cost of sales increased by approximately million  despite a substantial decline in sittings  resulting principally from manufacturing inefficiencies in the company s st 
louis production facility 
these inefficiencies related to integrating production previously handled by the company s las vegas production facility which was closed after the fiscal holiday season and production issues pertaining to the first busy season of producing both film and new digitally enhanced products discussed above

liquidity cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents on hand represent our expected sources of funds in to meet our obligations and commitments  including debt service  annual dividends to shareholders  planned capital expenditures and normal operating needs 
despite the decline in cash flow from continuing operations in and the continuing challenging and competitive sales environment  we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in  when coupled with cash on hand  to meet the above mentioned obligations and commitments 
page however  as referred to in the executive overview section of management s discussion and analysis  our new board is evaluating the possibility of discharging substantial cash to shareholders through large scale share repurchases and or a special distribution 
to effectuate such a return of capital would require either debt covenant relief from our existing senior note holders or a refinancing of the senior notes and an increase in our existing revolving credit facility to handle potential seasonal cash flow needs 
based on our discussions to date  our senior note holders have advised us that they are unwilling to grant the debt covenant relief necessary to effectuate a significant return of capital 
however  prior to the completion of the consent solicitation whereby there was material change in the composition of our board  we did receive a commitment from another lender to refinance the existing senior notes in the amount of million on a five year term and increase the current revolving credit facility from million to million and extend it for another three years 
because of the material change in the composition of the board resulting from the completion of the consent solicitation process  we are in ongoing discussions with the lender for purposes of determining their continued willingness to provide the financing and our new board s interest in pursuing the previous commitment 
at any rate  based on our discussions with lenders and knowledge of the current credit markets  we believe adequate funding sources are available on terms acceptable to the company  should the new board decide to pursue a significant return of capital
