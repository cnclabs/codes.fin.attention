item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
the company s greatest resource requirements include qualified drivers  tractors  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of drivers and the market for new and used trucks 
because the company is self insured for cargo  personal injury  and property damage claims on its trucks and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  the weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example  three years for tractors are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and long term are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates  including negative development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
the company s self insurance reserves are reviewed by an actuary at least annually 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of income and expense items to operating revenues for the years indicated 
operating revenues operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits fuel supplies and maintenance taxes and licenses insurance and claims depreciation rent and purchased transportation communications and utilities other total operating expenses operating income net interest expense and other income before income taxes income taxes net income the following table sets forth certain industry data regarding the freight revenues and operations of the company 
operating ratio average revenues per tractor per week      average annual miles per tractor      average annual trips per tractor average total miles per trip average loaded miles per trip average revenues per total mile average revenues per loaded mile average percentage of empty miles non trucking revenues in thousands      average tractors in service      total tractors at year end company      owner operator     total tractors      total trailers at year end      net of fuel surcharge revenues compared to operating revenues increased over  due primarily to a increase in the average number of tractors in service 
additionally  revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased primarily due to customer rate increases and better freight mix 
a better freight market and tightening truck capacity contributed to the improvement  compared to the weaker freight market of both truckload industry and company margins  while improving  are below levels management considers acceptable for the investment and risk of operating in this industry 
effective january  in response to changes in the driver hours of service regulations  the company increased its accessorial charges to customers for multiple stop shipments and its rates for equipment detention 
increases in operating expenses for driver stop pay and driver pay for delay time due to equipment detention are expected to offset this additional revenue in revenue per total mile  including fuel surcharges  increased compared to fuel surcharges  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  increased from million in to million in due to higher average fuel prices during see fuel explanation below 
excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased over the revenue increases described above were offset by a decline in average miles per tractor and a shorter average length of haul due to growth in the company s regional and dedicated fleets from of the fleet at december to of the fleet at december the new hours of service regulations may further reduce average miles per tractor in initial data compiled during the first eight weeks that the rules have been effective in compared to the same eight weeks of suggests a slight reduction in average miles per tractor due to the rule changes 
a stronger freight market in compared to the same period in is helping to offset the negative impact of the hours of service rule changes 
the company believes it is minimizing the impact on miles per tractor through proactive planning using its paperless log system and by working with customers to reduce delay time 
revenue from non trucking services increased million to million compared to during the latter part of and continuing into  the company expanded its brokerage and intermodal service offerings by adding senior management and developing new computer systems 
the growth in brokerage and intermodal is expected to help increase the company s non trucking revenues in these less asset intensive businesses are expected to have a lower operating margin and a higher return on assets than the company s truckload business 
freight demand began to improve in march of as compared to the same period in  and continued to be consistently better for most of the last ten months of compared to the corresponding period in the company believes much of the improvement was achieved by execution of the company s plan of limited fleet growth  maintenance of a diversified freight base that emphasizes consumer nondurable goods  and the shift from non dedicated to dedicated trucks discussed below 
the company s empty mile percentage increased from to  which is due in part to a shorter length of haul and a change in the mix of trucks to the dedicated fleet from the medium to long haul van fleet 
werner s dedicated services fleet provides truckload services required for a specific company  their plants  or their distribution centers 
werner grew its dedicated fleet from about one quarter of its total truck fleet at the end of to about one third of its total truck fleet at the end of  with much of this growth occurring in the fourth quarter of since the company s overall truck fleet grew trucks  the truck growth in the dedicated fleet was offset by a reduction in the company s medium to long haul van fleet 
dedicated fleet business tends to have lower miles per trip  a higher empty mile percentage  a higher rate per loaded mile  and lower miles per truck per month 
the growth in dedicated business has had a corresponding effect on these same operating statistics for the entire company 
the company s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues improved from in to in conversely  the company s operating margin improved from in to in operating expenses  when expressed as a percentage of total revenues  are lower in versus because of the higher revenue per mile and fuel surcharge revenue per mile 
owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this decrease contributed to a shift in costs from the rent and purchased transportation expense category as described on the following pages 
owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver and are responsible for their operating expenses including fuel  supplies and maintenance  and fuel taxes 
over the past year  it has continued to be difficult to attract and retain owner operator drivers due to challenging operating conditions 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased from to of revenues due primarily to the effect of the increase in revenue per mile  including fuel surcharge  offset by the growth in the percentage of company owned trucks to total trucks from at the end of to at the end of and an increase in the number of salaried drivers 
on a cost per total mile basis  total salaries  wages and benefits including driver and non driver costs increased from cents per mile to cents per mile 
the market for attracting and retaining company drivers continues to be challenging and became even more difficult in the fourth quarter of while the market for recruiting qualified drivers has tightened  the company continues to have success recruiting drivers from driver training schools 
the company anticipates that the competition for qualified drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
if such a shortage was to occur and increases in driver pay rates became necessary to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
salaries  wages and benefits includes expenses for workers compensation benefits 
the related accrued claims for workers compensation are reflected in insurance and claims accruals in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
effective july  the company changed its monthly mileage bonus pay program for van solo company drivers  which represents approximately one third of the company s total drivers 
the goal was to increase driver miles per truck by rewarding higher production from van solo drivers with higher pay 
the monthly mileage bonus pay increased by an average of  per month during the last six months of additionally  as described above  the company raised its driver stop pay in january in response to the new hours of service regulations and is implementing pay changes to drivers for delay time due to equipment detention 
fuel increased from to of revenues due to higher fuel prices 
the average price per gallon of diesel fuel  excluding fuel taxes  was approximately 
per gallon  or  higher in versus the company s customer fuel surcharge reimbursement programs have historically enabled the company to recover from its customers much of the higher fuel prices compared to normalized average fuel prices 
these fuel surcharges automatically adjust weekly through fuel surcharge price brackets 
conversely  when fuel prices decrease  fuel surcharges decrease 
after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs  net of company reimbursements to owner operators  earnings per share were not impacted by the higher fuel expense 
earnings per share were negatively impacted by 
per share in first quarter  positively impacted by 
and 
per share in the second and third quarters  respectively  and not impacted in fourth quarter to date  the company s ongoing testing of the epa compliant truck engines indicates that the fuel mile per gallon mpg degradation is a reduction of approximately mpg to mpg 
approximately of the company s fleet consists of epa compliant engines as of december  as the company adds more trucks with epa compliant engines to its fleet  fuel cost per mile is expected to increase 
shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
the company is unable to predict whether fuel prices will continue to increase or will decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance decreased from to of revenues due primarily to the effect of the increase in revenue per mile  including fuel surcharges  and improved management of maintenance expenses  offset slightly by the growth in the percentage of company owned trucks to total trucks 
insurance and claims increased from to of revenues due to an increase in the frequency and severity of claims  increased retention levels for claims  a higher cost per claim  and higher premiums for catastrophic liability coverage 
the company s premium rate for liability coverage up to million per claim is fixed through august   while coverage levels above million per claim were renewed effective august  for a one year period 
for the policy year beginning august  the company s total premiums for liability insurance increased by approximately million 
this increase includes premiums for terrorism coverage 
for the policy year beginning august  the company is self insured for claims in excess of million and less than million  subject to an annual maximum aggregate of million if several claims were to occur in this layer 
for claims in excess of million and less than million  the company is responsible for the first million of claims in this layer 
liability claims in excess of million per claim  if they occur  are covered under premium based policies with reputable insurance companies to coverage levels that management considers adequate 
the company is unable to predict whether the three year trend of increasing insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenues will continue in the future 
rent and purchased transportation decreased from to of revenues due to a decrease in payments to owner operators of revenues in compared to in  offset by an increase in purchased transportation for non trucking services 
the decrease in payments to owner operators resulted from the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total company miles as discussed previously  offset by higher fuel surcharge reimbursements paid to owner operators due to higher average fuel prices 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators because of challenging operating conditions 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of owner operator tractors from  as of december   to as of december  the company reimburses owner operators for the higher cost of fuel based on fuel surcharge reimbursements collected from customers 
the increase in purchased transportation for non trucking services corresponded to the higher non trucking revenues 
if the company grows its brokerage and intermodal services in  rent and purchased transportation costs for payments to third party providers are expected to rise accordingly 
other operating expenses decreased from to of revenues due primarily to an increase in the resale value of the company s used trucks 
because of truckload carrier concerns with new truck engines and lower industry production of new trucks  the resale value of the company s premium used trucks improved 
in  the company traded about one half of its used trucks and sold about one half of its used trucks and realized gains of million 
in  the company traded about one third of its used trucks and sold about two thirds to third parties 
in  due to a higher average sales price  and gain  per truck  the company realized gains of million 
the company s used truck retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the largest class truck sales entities in the united states and has been in operation since during first quarter  the company is expanding its network from locations to locations 
fleet truck sales continues to be a resource for the company to remarket its used trucks 
as discussed earlier  the company plans to extend the age of a portion of its trucks scheduled to be sold or traded during to allow for continued testing of the new trucks with epa compliant engines 
to the extent the company has fewer trucks available for sale  gains realized in could be lower than levels 
for trucks traded  the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks reduces the cost basis of new trucks  and therefore results in lower depreciation expense over the life of the asset 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense and professional service fees 
interest expense decreased to from of revenues due to a reduction in the company s borrowings 
average debt outstanding in was million 
in  outstanding debt totaled million throughout most of the year  until the company repaid its only remaining debt in december 
the company s effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was in and  respectively  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the company expects the income tax rate to increase in to due to an increase in non deductible expenses for tax purposes related to the implementation of a per diem pay program for student drivers in fourth quarter compared to operating revenues increased over  due primarily to a increase in the average number of tractors in service 
revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased primarily due to customer rate increases and better freight mix 
a better freight market and tightening truck capacity contributed to the improvement  compared to the weaker freight market of revenue per total mile  including fuel surcharges  increased compared to fuel surcharges  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  decreased from million in to million in due to lower average fuel prices during see fuel explanation below 
excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased over revenue from non trucking services increased million compared to freight demand began to improve in mid april of as compared to the same date in  and continued to be consistently better for the last eight and one half months of compared to the corresponding period in the company s empty mile percentage decreased from to 
the company believes much of the improvement was achieved by execution of the company s plan of limited fleet growth and maintenance of a diversified freight base that emphasizes consumer nondurable goods 
the company s operating ratio improved from in to in conversely  the company s operating margin improved from in to in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this decrease contributed to a shift in costs from the rent and purchased transportation expense category as described on the following pages 
salaries  wages and benefits increased from to of revenues due in part to an increase in the cost of workers compensation claims  higher workers compensation excess insurance premiums  and higher weekly state workers compensation payments 
the company renewed its workers compensation insurance coverage  and for the policy year beginning april  the company increased its self insurance retention from million to million per claim and has premium based coverage with a reputable insurance company for claims above this amount 
the company s premiums for this reduced coverage increased by approximately million over the premiums from the prior policy year 
in addition  the company added about employees in its maintenance department to reduce the higher cost of over the road repairs which are reflected in supplies and maintenance expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an improvement in health insurance expense 
fuel decreased from to of revenues due to lower fuel prices 
the average price per gallon of diesel fuel  excluding fuel taxes  was approximately 
per gallon  or  lower in versus however  as diesel fuel prices gradually declined during fourth quarter  prices rose during fourth quarter and averaged about 
per gallon  or  higher 
after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs  net of company reimbursements to owner operators  earnings per share decreased by approximately 
compared to  with most of the decrease occurring in fourth quarter as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance decreased from to of revenues due to improved management of maintenance expenses  including performing more maintenance at company facilities versus higher cost over the road maintenance 
the increase in the amount of maintenance being performed at company facilities required the hiring of additional maintenance personnel  resulting in a slight shift in expenses from the supplies and maintenance expense category to salaries  wages and benefits see salaries  wages and benefits explanation above 
insurance and claims increased from to of revenues due to less favorable claims experience in and higher excess insurance premiums 
the company renewed its annual liability insurance coverage for coverage in excess of million per claim effective august  for the policy year beginning august   the company s total premiums for liability insurance remained almost the same as the prior policy year while the company assumed liability for claims above million and below million per claim 
liability claims in excess of million per claim  if they occur  are covered under premium based policies with reputable insurance companies to coverage levels that management considers adequate 
rent and purchased transportation expense decreased from to of revenues due to a decrease in payments to owner operators of revenues in compared to in  offset by an increase in purchased transportation for non trucking services 
the decrease in payments to owner operators resulted from the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total company miles as discussed previously and lower fuel surcharge reimbursements paid to owner operators due to lower average fuel prices 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators because of challenging operating conditions 
this has resulted in a reduction in the number of owner operator tractors from  as of december   to  as of december  other operating expenses decreased from to of revenues due primarily to an increase in the resale value of the company s used trucks 
because of truckload carrier concerns with new truck engines and lower industry production of new trucks  the resale value of the company s premium used trucks has improved 
in  the company traded about half of its used trucks and sold about half of its used trucks and realized gains of million 
in  the company traded about two thirds of its used trucks and sold about one third to third parties 
in  due to a lower average sale price per truck  the company realized losses of million 
for trucks traded  the excess of the trade price over the net book value of the trucks reduced the cost basis of new trucks  and therefore resulted in lower depreciation expense over the life of the asset 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expenses and professional service fees 
net interest expense and other decreased from to of revenues due primarily to the company s gain on sale of a portion of its ownership in transplace in fourth quarter on december   the company finalized the sale  which reduced the company s ownership stake in transplace from to 
the company realized earnings of approximately 
per share during fourth quarter  representing the company s gain on sale of a portion of its ownership in transplace  net of losses recorded on its investment in transplace during the quarter 
werner relinquished its seat on the transplace board of directors 
transplace agreed to release werner from certain restrictions on competition within the transportation logistics marketplace 
the company s gain on sale of a portion of its ownership in transplace  net of losses recorded on its investment in transplace  is recorded as non operating income in the company s income statement 
interest expense decreased to from of revenues due to a reduction in the company s borrowings 
average debt outstanding in was million versus million in the company s effective income tax rate income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes was in and  respectively  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in  and million in cash flow from operations decreased million in over  or 
this decrease was due to lower truck purchases in this caused higher tax payments due to lower tax depreciation and a smaller payable for trucks received at year end 
these two items related to lower truck purchases reduced cash flow from operations by million in compared to the cash flow from operations enabled the company to make capital expenditures and repay debt as discussed below 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in the increase million from to and decrease million from to were due primarily to the company s accelerated purchases of tractors with pre october engines in the latter part of and purchasing fewer tractors in the engine emission standards that became effective october  did not allow the company sufficient time to test a significant sample of the new engines 
this prompted the company to purchase a large number of trucks with engines manufactured prior to october  which are not subject to the new engine emission standards  in addition to the normal number of new trucks required for the company s three year replacement cycle 
this enabled the company to delay the impact of using trucks with new engines in its fleet by approximately one year and allow additional time for testing 
the pre buy trucks were gradually placed in service throughout  with the last group of these trucks being placed into service during the third quarter 
as of december   approximately of the company s fleet consisted of trucks with the new engines 
to allow time for continued testing of the new trucks with epa compliant engines  the company has decided to extend the age of a portion of its trucks scheduled to be sold or traded during as of december   the company has committed to approximately million of net capital expenditures 
the company intends to fund these commitments through existing cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
net financing activities used million in  million in  and million in in   and  the company made net repayments of debt of million  million  and million  respectively 
the company paid dividends of million in  million in  and million in financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in and million in from time to time  the company has repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of its common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on market and other factors 
the company s board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to  shares 
on november   the company announced that its board of directors approved an increase to its authorization for common stock repurchases of  shares 
the previous authorization announced on december   authorized the company to repurchase  shares 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to this authorization and had  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes the company s financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents  no debt  and million of stockholders equity 
as of december   the company had no equipment operating leases  and therefore  had no off balance sheet equipment debt 
based on the company s strong financial position  management foresees no significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  as of december   the company had no debt outstanding 
below is a table of credit facilities and purchase commitments as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period in millions total other commercial amounts commitments committed less than year years years over years unused lines of credit standby letters of credit other commercial commitments total commercial commitments the company has two credit facilities with banks totaling million on which no borrowings were outstanding 
the credit available under these facilities is reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit the company maintains 
the unused lines of credit are available to the company in the event the company needs financing for the growth of its fleet 
with the company s strong financial position  the company expects it could obtain additional financing  if necessary  at favorable terms 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the other commercial commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any arrangements which meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  fuel  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
forward looking statements and risk factors this discussion and analysis contains historical and forward looking information 
the forward looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company believes the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements are reasonable based on information currently available  however any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risks and uncertainties 
those risks include  but are not limited to  the following the company s business is modestly seasonal with peak freight demand occurring generally in the months of september  october  and november 
during the winter months  the company s freight volumes are typically lower as some customers have lower shipment levels after the christmas holiday season 
the company s operating expenses have historically been higher in winter months primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency  increased maintenance costs of revenue equipment in colder weather  and increased insurance and claims costs due to adverse winter weather conditions 
the company attempts to minimize the impact of seasonality through its marketing program by seeking additional freight from certain customers during traditionally slower shipping periods 
bad weather  holidays  and the number of business days during the period can also affect revenue  since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers 
the trucking industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of trucking companies 
the company estimates the ten largest truckload carriers have less than ten percent of the approximate billion market targeted by the company 
this competition could limit the company s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes primarily with other truckload carriers 
railroads  less than truckload carriers  and private carriers also provide competition  but to a much lesser degree 
competition for the freight transported by the company is based primarily on service and efficiency and  to some degree  on freight rates alone 
the company is sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes 
the general slowdown in the economy since had a negative effect on freight volumes for truckload carriers  including the company 
during  freight demand for the company during the last ten months was consistently better than as the unemployment rate increased during and  driver availability improved for the company and the industry but became more difficult in fourth quarter fuel prices increased beginning in fourth quarter and were high through and before decreasing in the latter part of due to pending concerns in the middle east and other factors  fuel prices began to rise in the second quarter of  continued to increase throughout the second half of  and increased further in the first part of in the last nine months of  prices decreased again  ending at prices slightly higher than at the end of shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the company 
to the extent that the company cannot recover the higher cost of fuel through customer fuel surcharges  the company s results would be negatively impacted 
future economic conditions that may affect the company include employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  interest rates  and tax rates 
the company is regulated by the dot and the federal and provincial transportation departments in canada 
these regulatory authorities establish broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and other matters 
the company may become subject to new or more comprehensive regulations relating to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other issues mandated by the dot  epa  or the federal and provincial transportation departments in canada 
for example  new engine emissions standards became effective for truck engine manufacturers in october and new hours of service regulations became effective on january  the company believes it is minimizing the impact of the new hours of service regulations on miles per truck through proactive planning using its paperless log system and by working closely with customers to reduce delay time 
however  the company is unable to predict the ultimate impact of the new hours of service rules 
these changes could have an adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
at times  there have been shortages of drivers in the trucking industry 
the market for recruiting drivers became more difficult in fourth quarter the company anticipates that the competition for company drivers will continue to be high 
during   and  it was more difficult to recruit and retain owner operator drivers due to challenging operating conditions  including high fuel prices 
the company anticipates that the competition for company drivers and owner operator drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
the company is highly dependent on the services of key personnel including clarence l 
werner and other executive officers 
although the company believes it has an experienced and highly qualified management group  the loss of the services of these executive officers could have a material adverse impact on the company and its future profitability 
the company is dependent on its vendors and suppliers 
the company believes it has good relationships with its vendors and that it is generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors and suppliers 
if the company fails to maintain good relationships with its vendors and suppliers or if its vendors and suppliers experience significant financial problems  the company could face difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services because of interruptions of production or for other reasons  which could adversely affect the company s business 
the efficient operation of the company s business is highly dependent on its information systems 
much of the company s software has been developed internally or by adapting purchased software applications to the company s needs 
the company has purchased redundant computer hardware systems and has its own off site disaster recovery facility approximately ten miles from the company s offices to use in the event of a disaster 
the company has taken these steps to reduce the risk of disruption to its business operation if a disaster were to occur 
the company self insures for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  and property damage as well as workers compensation 
this is supplemented by premium insurance with licensed insurance companies above the company s self insurance level for each type of coverage 
to the extent that the company was to experience a significant increase in the number of claims or the cost per claim  the company s operating results would be negatively affected 
effective october   all newly manufactured truck engines must comply with the engine emission standards mandated by the environmental protection agency epa 
all truck engines manufactured prior to october  were not subject to these new standards 
the company is continuing ongoing testing of the epa compliant truck engines  in particular the caterpillar acert engines and the detroit diesel egr engines 
approximately of the company s fleet consisted of trucks with post october engines at december  to date  the company s testing indicates that the fuel mile per gallon mpg degradation is a reduction of approximately mpg to mpg with either engine type 
depreciation expense is increasing due to the higher cost of the new engines 
the average age of the company s truck fleet is years as of december  to allow time for continued testing of the new trucks with epa compliant engines  the company has decided to extend the age of a portion of its trucks scheduled to be sold or traded during because of truckload carrier concerns with new truck engines and lower industry production of new trucks over the last three years  the resale value of werner s premium used trucks has improved from the historically low values of gains on sales of equipment are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses in the company s income statement and amounted to gains of million in and million in  compared to a loss of million in extending the ages of a portion of the company s truck fleet in may reduce the number of trucks available for sales to third parties or trades to the manufacturers 
thus  the extent of the company s sales of used trucks in will depend on the ongoing testing of the new engines  freight demand  driver availability  and used truck pricing 
caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements made herein  since the statements speak only as of the date they are made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company had no debt outstanding at december  interest rates on the company s unused credit facilities are based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
increases in interest rates could impact the company s annual interest expense on future borrowings 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  and other market factors 
historically  the company has been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the company cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
the company conducts business in mexico and canada 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations for and prior years 
accordingly  the company is not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the company s future costs or on future cash flows 
to date  the company receives payment for freight services performed in mexico and canada primarily in us dollars to reduce foreign currency risk
