mortgage insurance is dependent on a small number of lenders for providing a substantial portion of its business 
mortgage insurance s top lenders were responsible for of the direct primary risk in force at december  the top lenders were also responsible for of primary new insurance written in the highest state concentration of risk is california at 
at december   california also accounted for of mortgage insurance s total direct primary insurance in force and of mortgage insurance direct primary new insurance written for the largest single customer of mortgage insurance including branches and affiliates of such customer  measured by new insurance written  accounted for of new insurance written during  compared to in the concentration of business with lenders may increase or decrease as a result of many factors 
these lenders may reduce the amount of business currently given to mortgage insurance or cease doing business with it altogether 
mortgage insurance s master policies and related lender agreements do not  and by law cannot  require its lenders to do business with it 
the loss of business from a major lender could materially adversely affect mortgage insurance s and the company s business and financial results 
the company expects customer concentration to be a continuous trend as a result of the ongoing consolidation in the financial services industry in general and the mortgage industry in particular 
primary new insurance written during was billion  a increase from billion written in this increase in mortgage insurance s primary new insurance written volume in was primarily due to a large increase in insurance written both through flow business loans insured on an individual basis and structured transactions 
during  mortgage insurance wrote billion in structured transactions compared to billion in of this amount in  billion was written in the first three months of the year 
the amount written in the first quarter of includes a large structured transaction for one customer composed of prime mortgage loans originated throughout the united states 
the company s participation in the structured transaction market is likely to vary from year to year as the company competes with other mortgage insurers  as well as capital market executions for these transactions 
during  mortgage insurance wrote million of pool insurance risk compared to million in the majority of this pool risk consisted of prime and alternative a alt a loans 
mortgage insurance s volume in continued to be impacted by low interest rates that affected the entire mortgage industry 
the continued low interest rate environment caused refinancing activity to remain high throughout  and contributed to the industry s significant volume of new insurance volume in mortgage insurance s refinancing activity as a percentage of primary new insurance written was for 
table of contents compared to in the persistency rate  which is defined as the percentage of insurance in force that remains on the company s books after any month period  was for the months ended december   as compared to for the same period of this decrease was consistent with the increasing level of refinancing activity  which caused the cancellation rate to increase 
the expectation for is a slowdown in the industry volume of new insurance written and an increase in persistency rates throughout the year  influenced by flat to slowly rising interest rates 
net premiums earned in were million  a million or increase from million for the increase  which was greater than the increase in direct primary insurance in force  reflected a significant increase in non traditional new insurance volume in radian insurance inc radian insurance and amerin guaranty  which is included in other risk in force and a higher percentage of non prime business 
premiums earned in radian insurance and amerin guaranty  primarily from credit insurance on mortgage related assets and second mortgages  were million in compared to million in and approximately million in as further discussed below  non prime business has higher premium rates  which are commensurate with the increased level of expected losses associated with the insurance 
the insurance in force growth resulting from strong new insurance volume in was offset by a decrease in persistency levels 
these lower persistency levels will continue to impact premiums earned in future periods to the extent that insurance in force growth slows 
direct primary insurance in force increased to billion at december  from billion a year ago 
total pool risk in force was billion at december  compared to billion at december  the office of federal housing enterprise oversight issued new risk based capital regulations for fannie mae and freddie mac  which took effect september  the most relevant provision to the company is a distinction between aaa rated insurers and aa rated insurers 
the new regulations impose a credit haircut that fannie mae and freddie mac are given for exposure ceded to aaa insurers by and to aa insurers by 
currently  radian guaranty is rated aa  one other mortgage insurance provider is rated aaa 
as a result  there may be an incentive for the gses to use private mortgage insurance provided by a aaa rated insurer 
the provisions of the new regulations are to be phased in over a year period commencing on the effective date of the regulation 
there has been no impact on the company as a result of this change 
the company insures non traditional loans  specifically alt a and a minus loans collectively  referred to as non prime business 
alt a borrowers have a similar credit profile to the company s prime borrowers  but these loans are underwritten with reduced documentation and verification of information 
the company typically charges a higher premium rate for this business due to the reduced documentation  but the company does not consider this business to be significantly more risky than its prime business  as long as the loans contain credit scores similar to the prime business 
the a minus loan programs typically have non traditional credit standards that are less stringent than standard credit guidelines 
to compensate for this additional risk  the company receives a higher premium for insuring this product that the company believes is commensurate with the additional default risk 
during  non prime business accounted for billion or of mortgage insurance s new primary insurance written compared to billion or for the same period in at december   non prime insurance in force was billion or of total primary insurance in force as compared to billion or of primary insurance in force a year ago 
of the billion of non prime business in  billion or was alt a 
the company anticipates that the trend of a higher mix of non traditional insured loans will continue as a result of alternative competitive products in the prime loan area  such as second mortgages 
the company insures mortgage related assets in a pennsylvania domiciled insurer  radian insurance 
radian insurance is rated aa by s p and fitch ratings fitch and aa by moody s investors service and was formed to write credit insurance on mortgage related assets that are not permitted to be insured by monoline mortgage guaranty insurers 
such assets include second mortgages  manufactured housing loans  home equity loans and mortgages with loan to value ratios above 
radian insurance also provides credit enhancement to mortgage related capital market transactions 
in october  radian insurance entered into a reinsurance agreement with one of its affiliates  radian asset assurance inc  for a substantial part of its business 
table of contents at that time 
in  most of the credit insurance on mortgage and mortgage related assets was written in radian asset assurance 
some of this business was reinsured by radian insurance 
during  this business was written in both radian asset assurance and radian insurance 
risk in force in radian insurance and amerin was billion at december  compared to 
billion at december  the company expects that future business will be written by both radian insurance and radian asset assurance  but that the risk will remain on the company that originated the business 
mortgage insurance and other companies in the industry have entered into risk revenue sharing arrangements with various customers that are designed to allow the customer to participate in the risks and rewards of the mortgage insurance business 
one such product is captive reinsurance  in which a mortgage lender establishes a mortgage reinsurance company that assumes part of the risk associated with that lender s insured book of business 
in most cases  the risk assumed by the reinsurance company is an excess layer of aggregate losses that would be penetrated only in a situation of adverse loss development 
for  premiums ceded under captive reinsurance arrangements were million  or of total premiums earned during  as compared to million  or of total premiums earned for the same period of new primary insurance written under captive reinsurance arrangements was billion  or of total new primary insurance written in as compared to billion  or of total new primary insurance written in the company has experienced a trend toward increased use of these risk revenue sharing arrangements at increased percentage levels 
the company continues to evaluate the level of revenue sharing against risk sharing on a customer by customer basis 
net investment income for was million  compared to million in this slight increase was a result of continued growth in invested assets  primarily due to positive operating cash flows during and the allocation of interest income from net financing activities  offset by declining investment yields that were experienced throughout the year 
the company has continued to invest some of its net operating cash flow in tax advantaged securities  primarily municipal bonds  although the company s investment policy allows the purchase of various other asset classes including common stock and convertible securities 
the company s common equity exposure is targeted at a maximum of of the investment portfolio s market value  while the investment grade convertible securities and investment grade taxable bond exposure are each targeted not to exceed the provision for losses was million for  an increase of million or from million in primarily as a result of a higher mix of non traditional insured loans 
this resulted primarily from an increase in claims coupled with higher delinquency or default rates 
claim activity is not spread evenly throughout the coverage period of a book of business 
relatively few claims on prime business are received during the first two years following issuance of a policy and on non prime business during the first year 
historically  claim activity on prime loans has reached its highest level in the third through fifth years after the year of policy origination and on non prime loans  this level is expected to be reached in the second through fourth years 
approximately of the primary risk in force and approximately of the pool risk in force at december  had not yet reached its highest claim frequency years 
the combined default rate for both primary and pool insurance  excluding second lien insurance coverage  was at december   compared to at december   while the default rate on the primary business was at december  compared to at december  the change in the default rate on the primary business was caused by a basis point increase in the delinquency rate on the non prime business as a result of that business seasoning  with the delinquency rate on the prime business up basis points year over year as described in the following tables 
a strong economy generally results in better loss experience and a decrease in the overall level of losses 
a continued weakening of the economy could negatively impact the company s overall default rates  which would result in an increase in the provision for losses 
the total number of defaults increased from  at december  to  at december  the average loss reserve per default decreased from  at the end of to  at december  the slowing of the economy  as well as a higher mix of non prime insured loans  contributed to the rising 
table of contents level of mortgage delinquencies 
the lower reserve per default is a result of a higher percentage of newer business which has not reached peak delinquency 
the loss reserve as a percentage of risk in force was at december   compared to at december  the non prime mortgage insurance business has experienced a consistent increase in the number of defaults 
although the default rate on this business is higher than on the prime book of business  the higher premium rates charged for the non prime business are expected to compensate for the increased level of expected losses associated with this business 
the number of non prime loans in default at december  was  which represented of the total primary loans in default  compared to  non prime loans in default at december   which represented of the total primary loans in default 
the default rate on the alt a business was at december  compared to at december  the default rate on the a minus and below loans was at december  compared to at december  it is too early to determine whether ultimate losses on the non prime business will reflect the assumptions made when the business was originated 
the default rate on the prime business was at december  and at december  direct claims paid for were million compared to million for the severity of loss payments has increased over the past few years due primarily to deeper coverage amounts and larger loan balances 
in addition  claims paid in have been impacted by the rise in delinquencies in and that have proceeded to foreclosure 
a disproportionately higher incidence of claims in georgia and utah is directly related to questionable property value estimates in those states 
the company s risk management department identified these issues several years ago and has put into place several property valuation checks and balances to mitigate the risk of these issues from recurring 
further  these same techniques are being applied to all mortgage insurance transactions 
the company expects this higher incidence of claims in georgia and utah to continue until loans originated in georgia and utah prior to the implementation of these preventive measures become sufficiently seasoned 
the higher level of claim incidence in texas partly resulted from unemployment levels which were higher than the national average and lower home price appreciation 
the company believes that claims in the midwest and southeast have been rising and will continue to rise due to the weakening of the industrial sector of the economy 
the company anticipates that overall claim payments will continue to increase in net income for was million  an increase of million or from million in this increase resulted from increases in earned premiums and investment income  partially offset by increases in the provision for losses  policy acquisition and other operating expenses and interest expense

the sum of the above adjustments related to this recapture resulted in an estimated initial reduction of pre tax income of million and is summarized as follows cash paid received gaap book basis initial gain loss in thousands unearned premium acquisition costs case reserves receivable from unrealized credit derivatives gain totals the company estimates that the amount of capital it is holding to support this recaptured insurance business approximates million 
such capital could potentially be redeployed for additional reinsurance  including reinsurance of obligations primarily insured by radian asset assurance  other opportunities with possibly higher returns to the company than the reinsurance business recaptured by the primary insurer  or if the potential merger as defined below were to be consummated  to write additional direct financial guaranty insurance 
since the acquisition of radian reinsurance by the company in february  reinsurance assumed from this primary insurer resulted in million of written premium and million of earned premium in  million of written premium and million of earned premium in and million of written premium and million of earned premium for the company estimates that for  the recapture of reinsurance business will reduce pre tax income by million or approximately per share after tax 
this results from the one time loss related to the difference in stat and gaap unearned premiums on the recaptured business  as well as income lost in from the recaptured business 
future downgrades could trigger the primary financial guaranty insurers to recapture additional financial guaranty business that was assumed by radian reinsurance 
the estimated impact of potential downgrades  excluding the impact of the business that has already been recaptured  is as follows billion of par is subject to recapture in the event of a one notch downgrade 
billion of par is subject to recapture in the event of a two notch downgrade 
there have been internal discussions regarding  and management has taken steps toward  the merger of the financial guaranty reinsurance business of radian reinsurance into radian asset assurance the potential merger 
if the potential merger were to occur  the financial guaranty reinsurance business currently conducted by radian reinsurance and the direct financial guaranty business conducted by radian asset assurance would be conducted by radian asset assurance as part of one company  and radian asset assurance would have greater assets  liabilities and shareholder s equity than it currently has on a stand alone basis 
however  the potential merger has not been fully approved by either radian asset assurance s or radian reinsurance s respective boards of directors and shareholder 
in addition  if such a merger were to occur  the transaction and its potential effects on radian asset assurance and radian reinsurance would have to be approved by applicable regulatory bodies  including the new york insurance department and relevant rating agencies 
financial guaranty has received preliminary regulatory approval from the new york and california insurance departments to the potential merger  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions 
however  there can be no assurance that the potential merger will occur 

table of contents if the potential merger were to occur  the stat capital available to radian asset assurance to write direct insurance would increase in an amount equal to the stat capital of radian reinsurance 
consequently  radian asset assurance s regulatory and rating agency single risk exposure limits would increase to permit radian asset assurance to insure and retain net exposure to larger risks than radian asset assurance would be able to without the potential merger  without the need to find ample reinsurance capacity  whether from radian reinsurance or an unaffiliated third party 
similarly  the combined entity with larger regulatory and rating agency single risk exposure limits would be able to reinsure and retain net exposure to larger risks than radian reinsurance would be able to write without the potential merger  without the need to retrocede its risk to radian asset assurance or an unaffiliated third party 
radian asset assurance also anticipates that its internally established criteria for single risk exposure should also permit it to retain exposure to larger risks 
there can be no assurance  however  that radian asset assurance would be able to insure or reinsure larger risks on terms and conditions acceptable to radian asset assurance 
the company believes that the potential merger could have the effect of making the rating of the larger combined financial guaranty company from the major rating agencies more stable  and could decrease the risk of a downgrade of radian asset assurance by such agencies 
however  the rating agencies are reviewing the potential merger and its potential effects on financial guaranty  and such review could result in a change in the rating either positive or negative of a combined financial guaranty company 
any determination by any of the rating agencies to lower any of its ratings for the combined financial guaranty company from those currently in effect for either radian asset assurance or radian reinsurance could affect a decision whether or not to proceed with the potential merger  and if the potential merger were consummated notwithstanding a lowering of the combined financial guaranty company rating  it could have a materially adverse effect on financial guaranty s business and would permit its largest financial guaranty primary insurance customers to terminate their current reinsurance relationships with radian reinsurance and recapture the reinsurance business ceded to radian reinsurance 
see ratings in this item for a description of the rights of certain of radian reinsurance s customers upon a downgrade of the rating of radian reinsurance 
in addition  if the potential merger were to occur  the company believes that its current and potential customers would view the combined entity more favorably since radian asset assurance would have materially greater stat capital 
the customers credit exposure limits to radian asset assurance should increase as a result of radian asset assurance s greater capital that could result in the ability of radian asset assurance s customers to enter into a greater number of and larger sized transactions with radian asset assurance  especially in its structured finance business  than they would without the potential merger 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the effect the potential merger would have on the number and size of transactions that customers would enter into with radian asset assurance 
however  financial guaranty s reinsurance customers may view the combined financial guaranty company as more of a competitor and a threat to their business and prospects  since the combined financial guaranty company would be a larger entity that not only reinsures their obligations  but also could directly insure larger obligations in competition with them 
even if the combined financial guaranty company ratings were not changed or reduced as a result of the potential merger  any of financial guaranty s customers could i compete with radian asset assurance more vigorously than they do now on the direct financial guaranty company transactions radian asset assurance insures  ii materially reduce or eliminate the reinsurance currently ceded by such customer to radian reinsurance  iii if such customer does not consent to the potential merger and its reinsurance agreements with radian reinsurance does not permit radian reinsurance to merge with another entity  exercise any right to recapture all of the business ceded to radian reinsurance under such agreements  or iv become more reluctant to partner with financial guaranty on transactions 
consequently  financial guaranty would i experience a reduction in the number of transactions entered into  the premium received and or the premium rate relative to the insurance exposure on future direct financial guaranty insurance transactions  ii have a material reduction in future reinsurance premiums written and earned  and or iii be required to return unearned premiums previously received by radian reinsurance 
a reduction in direct insurance or reinsurance premiums received or the premium rates received  or the requirement to return unearned premium to the ceding 
table of contents company could have a material adverse effect on financial guaranty s business 
since radian reinsurance has a relatively small number of customers  primarily consisting of most of the largest financial guaranty primary insurers  if any of these customers were to reduce or eliminate the reinsurance ceded to financial guaranty  or to require the return of unearned premium  it could have a material adverse effect on financial guaranty 
if the potential merger were to occur  the reinsurance  public finance and structured finance business would be written by radian asset assurance  which would have greater assets  liabilities and shareholder s equity than either radian asset assurance or radian reinsurance would have in the absence of the potential merger

as a result  the company believes that radian asset assurance has begun to have additional opportunities to write financial guaranty insurance  particularly on public finance obligations  which could favorably increase radian asset assurance s net premiums written in the public finance direct area in the near future  and subsequently increase radian asset assurance s net premiums earned as such premium written becomes earned over the life of the obligations insured 
in august  the financial services authority of the united kingdom granted permission under part iv of the financial services markets act for radian asset assurance limited raal  a subsidiary of radian asset assurance  to conduct an insurance business in the united kingdom 
as a result of this additional authority  through raal  the company will have additional opportunities to write financial guaranty insurance in the united kingdom and  subject to compliance with the european passport rules  throughout the european union  which could increase radian asset assurance s net premiums written on a consolidated basis in the future  and subsequently increase its net premiums earned on a consolidated basis  as such premium written becomes earned over the life of the obligations insured

for securities classified as either available for sale or held to maturity  the company conducts a quarterly evaluation of declines in market value of the investment portfolio asset basis to determine whether the decline is other than temporary 
this evaluation includes a review of the length of time and extent to which fair value is below amortized cost  issuer financial condition  and intent and ability of the company to retain its investment over a period of time to allow recovery in fair value 
the company uses a decline in price over four continuous quarters as a guide in identifying those securities that should be evaluated for impairment

reserve for losses as described in notes and to consolidated financial statements  the company establishes reserves to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims in both the mortgage insurance and financial guaranty business 
setting loss reserves in both businesses involves the significant use of estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
in the mortgage insurance business  the incurred loss process is initiated by a borrower s missed payment 
the company uses historical models based on a variety of loan characteristics  including the status of the loan as reported by the servicer of the loan  the economic conditions  and the estimated foreclosure period in the area where the default exists to help determine the appropriate loss reserve at any point in time 
as the delinquency proceeds toward foreclosure  there is more certainty around these estimates as a result of the aged status of the delinquent loan and adjustments are made to loss reserves to reflect this updated information 
with respect to delinquent loans that are in an early stage of delinquency  considerable judgment is exercised as to the adequacy of reserve levels 
the company relies on its historical models and makes adjustments to its estimates based on current economic conditions and recent trend information 
these adjustments in estimates for delinquent loans in the early stage of delinquency are more volatile in nature than for loans that are in the later stage of delinquency 
if a default cures  the reserve for that loan is removed from the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses lae 
this curing process causes an appearance of a reduction in reserve from prior years 
the company also reserves for defaults that have occurred but have not been reported using historical information on defaults not reported on a timely basis by lending institutions 
the estimates are continually reviewed and  as adjustments to these liabilities become necessary  such adjustments are reflected in current operations 
reserves for losses and lae in the financial guaranty business are established based on the company s estimate of specific and non specific losses  including expenses associated with settlement of such losses on its insured and reinsured obligations 
the company s estimation of total reserves considers known defaults  reports and individual loss estimates reported by ceding companies and annual increases in the total net par amount outstanding of the company s insured obligations 
the company records a specific provision for losses and related lae when reported by primary insurers or when  in the company s opinion  an insured risk is in default or default is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
in the case of obligations with fixed periodic payments  the provision for losses and lae represents the present value of the company s ultimate expected losses  adjusted for estimated recoveries under salvage or subrogation rights 
the non specific reserves represent the company s estimate of total reserves  less provisions for specific reserves 
generally  when a case basis reserve is established or adjusted  an offsetting adjustment is made to the non specific reserve 
in  the company provided approximately million of reserves on a manufactured housing transaction with conseco finance corp 
which represents the total par exposure on this transaction 
losses are expected to be paid out over the next several years 
no claims have been paid as of december  this transaction had been performing within expectations 
the bankruptcy of conseco led to a deterioration in the transaction s performance 
when the company performed its year end review  which incorporated financial projections of the transaction s performance over its remaining life  it decided it was necessary to establish reserves for the entire exposure 

table of contents reserve for losses and lae for financial guaranty s other lines of business  primarily trade credit reinsurance  are based on reports and individual loss estimates received from ceding companies  net of anticipated estimate recoveries under salvage and subrogation rights 
in addition  a reserve is included for losses and lae incurred  but not reported on trade credit insurance 
setting the loss reserves in both business segments involves significant reliance upon estimates with regard to the likelihood  magnitude and timing of a loss 
the models and estimates the company uses to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate  especially during an extended economic downturn 
there can be no assurance that the company has correctly estimated the necessary amount of reserves or that the reserves established will be adequate to cover ultimate losses on incurred defaults 
management believes that reserves are adequate to cover expected losses 
if the company s estimates are inadequate  it may be forced by insurance and other regulators or rating agencies to increase its reserves 
unanticipated increases to its reserves could lead to a reduction in the company s and its subsidiaries ratings 
such a reduction in ratings could have a significant negative impact on the company s ability to attract and retain business 
derivative instruments and hedging activity the company accounts for derivatives under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended and interpreted 
the two areas where gains and losses on derivative contracts are recognized are in the convertible debt securities contained in the company s investment portfolio and in certain financial guaranty contracts 
the value of the derivative position of convertible debt securities is calculated by the company s outside convertible debt portfolio manager by determining the value of the readily ascertainable comparable debt securities and assigning a value to the equity derivative portion by subtracting the value of the comparable debt security from the total value of the convertible instrument 
changes in such values from period to period represent the gains and losses recorded 
the gains and losses on direct derivative financial guaranty contracts are derived from internally generated models 
the gains and losses on assumed derivative financial guaranty contracts are provided by the primary insurance companies 
the estimated fair value amounts have been determined by the company using market information to the extent available  and appropriate valuation methodologies 
significant differences may exist with respect to the available market information and assumptions used to determine gains and losses on derivative financial guaranty contracts 
considerable judgment is required to interpret available market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts the company could realize in a current market exchange due to the lack of a liquid market 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
a summary of the company s derivative information as of and for the periods indicated is as follows december in millions balance sheet trading securities amortized cost fair value derivative financial guaranty contracts notional value gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses net unrealized losses

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company manages its investment portfolio to achieve safety and liquidity  while seeking to maximize total return 
the company believes it can achieve these objectives by active portfolio management and intensive monitoring of investments 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the market risk related to financial instruments primarily relates to the investment portfolio  which exposes the company to risks related to interest rates  default  prepayments  and declines in equity prices 
interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a fixed income security to changes in interest rates 
the company views these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability management 
the company s analysts estimate the payout pattern of the mortgage insurance loss reserves to determine their duration  which are the weighted average payments expressed in years 
the company sets duration targets for fixed income investment portfolios that it believes mitigate the overall effect of interest rate risk 
as of december   the average duration of the fixed income portfolio was years 
based upon assumptions the company uses in its duration calculations  increases in interest rates of and basis points would cause decreases in the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio excluding short term investments of approximately and  respectively 
similarly  a decrease in interest rates of and basis points would cause increases in the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio of approximately and  respectively 
at december   the company had no material foreign investments and its investment in non investment grade fixed income securities was million 
at december   the market value and cost of the company s equity securities were million and million  respectively 
in addition  the market value and cost of the company s short term and long term debt at december  were million and million  respectively
