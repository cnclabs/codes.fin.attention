overview we are a leading provider of industry standard processor architectures and cores for digital consumer and business applications 
we design and license high performance and bit architectures and cores  which offer smaller dimensions and greater energy efficiency in embedded processors 
our technology is utilized in many high growth embedded markets including digital set top boxes  digital televisions  dvd recordable devices  broadband access devices  digital cameras  laser printers and network routers 
mips technologies  inc previously existed as a division of silicon graphics  inc following their acquisition of mips computer systems  inc 
in we were separated from the business of silicon graphics  effective june  at that time silicon graphics transferred to us the assets and liabilities and intellectual property related to our business 
our focus became the design and development of processor intellectual property for the embedded market 
we entered fiscal year having experienced two consecutive years of losses and declining sales 
we needed to implement plans to address both declining sales and lack of profits 
the first key element was to address the weak return we had been experiencing with our custom core development activity 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we announced  and we subsequently implemented  a plan to cease this activity once we completed contractual obligations in september this helped reduce our operating expenses by in fiscal and we were able to return to profitability in the december quarter and increase profitability in each of the subsequent quarters 
the second key element was to execute on our plans to complete an advanced high performance product family  the mips k core family  which would enhance our broad processor core portfolio offering to our customers 
the k core family was introduced on schedule in the march quarter and contributed to an increase in our contract revenue during the second half of the fiscal year 
revenue for fiscal increased year over year for the first time in four years driven by a increase in royalties 
the increase in royalties was generated primarily from a growth in royalties from license agreements signed since our initial public offering as customers under these license agreements are shipping more products incorporating our technology 
our future growth will depend considerably on our receipt of meaningful royalties from these customers 
royalties contributed nearly half of our total revenue during fiscal despite the growth in revenue  we reported a net loss of million in fiscal due to a restructuring charge of million recorded in our first fiscal quarter 
in fiscal year  we will face new challenges in maintaining our growth and profitability  while establishing new initiatives and executing on our next set of product development offerings 
we will need to capitalize on the momentum of the new k core family to grow our contract revenue 
we also expect to pursue additional relationships with third party independent software  hardware and intellectual property vendors and to add a broader range of development tools 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase in fiscal as we begin to reinvest in projects and programs to support our future growth 
revenue 
our revenue consists of royalties and contract revenue earned under contracts with our licensees 
our contracts with our licensees are typically subject to periodic renewal or extension and expire at various dates through june although the precise terms of our contracts vary  they typically provide for royalties  technology license fees for currently available technology or engineering service fees for technology under development  and maintenance fees 
we generate royalties from the sale by our licensees of products incorporating our technology 
royalty revenue is recognized in the quarter in which a report is received from a licensee detailing the shipments of products incorporating our intellectual property  which is in the quarter following the sale of the licensee s product to its customer 
royalties are calculated either as a percentage of the revenue received by the seller on sales of such products or on a per unit basis 
in fiscal  royalties accounted for approximately of our total revenue  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our ability to diversify our revenue base will depend primarily on the number and variety of design wins we obtain from digital consumer product and business equipment manufacturers  and consumer acceptance of products that incorporate our technology 
we generally do not have a direct contractual relationship with digital consumer product manufacturers and the royalty reports submitted by our licensees generally do not disclose which consumer products include our technology 
as a result  it is difficult for us to identify or predict the extent to which our future revenue will depend upon a particular digital consumer product or product manufacturer 
we generate contract revenue from technology license fees for currently available technology and engineering service fees for technology under development 
each of these types of contracts is a nonexclusive license for the underlying intellectual property 
while we may be required to perform certain services to render the intellectual property suitable for license under an engineering service contract  we continue to own the intellectual property that we develop 
the amount of the license fee under an engineering service agreement is primarily a function of our determination of the underlying value of the technology rather than our cost of completing the development of the technology required by the agreement 
we also have the right to license to other licensees the intellectual property developed under engineering service agreements 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin referred to as sab no 
revenue recognition which superceded sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  technology license fees are recorded as revenue upon the execution of the license agreement when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred and collectibility is probable 
technology license fees vary based on  among other things  whether a particular technology is licensed for a single application or for multiple or unlimited applications  and whether the license granted covers a particular design or a broader architecture 
engineering service fees are related to engineering services contracts  which are performed on a best efforts basis and for which we receive periodic milestone payments 
engineering service fees are recognized as revenue over the estimated development period using a cost based percentage of completion method 
in most instances  the technology under development  including under engineering services contracts  can be licensed to multiple customers 
our revenue is derived from a global customer base 
we have sales offices in japan  germany  taiwan and israel 
further  most of our international licensees have customers worldwide including those based in the united states 
international revenue accounted for approximately of our total revenue in fiscal  of our total revenue in fiscal and of our total revenue in fiscal substantially all of this revenue has been denominated in us dollars 
we expect that revenue derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
costs and expenses 
our costs and expenses generally include cost of contract revenue  research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
cost of contract revenue 
cost of contract revenue consists of sublicense fees  which we become obligated to pay when we sublicense to our customers technology that we have licensed from third parties 
sublicense fees are recognized as cost of contract revenue when the obligation is incurred  which is typically the same period in which the related revenue is recognized 
research and development 
research and development expenses include salaries and contractor and consultant fees  as well as costs related to workstations  software  and computer aided design tools 
the costs we incur with respect to internally developed technology and engineering services are included in research and development expenses as they are incurred and are not directly related to any particular licensee  license agreement or license fee 
research and development expense also includes the amortization of purchased intangible assets 
in december  we acquired from lexra  inc certain technology related to our processor architectures  which consisted of developed technology which was recorded at a value of million and core technology which was recorded at a value of million 
as part of our restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal  we decided to reduce our investment in research and development  and revised our product development plans 
given constraints on our resources  we determined that we would not seek to integrate into our product plans the developed technology we acquired from lexra  inc in december and determined that such developed technology had no value and recorded an impairment charge of million for the remaining value of this intangible asset in fiscal developed and core technologies are being amortized and charged to research and development expense  on a straight line basis  over their estimated useful lives of three and seven years  respectively 
during fiscal  we purchased certain patents and patent applications for an aggregate consideration of million 
patent costs are being amortized and charged to research and development expense  on a straight line basis  over their estimated useful lives of ten years 
research and development expense included costs related to the accelerated amortization and depreciation of assets whose useful life was changed because of the restructuring actions announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million in fiscal and  in fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and costs associated with third party independent software development tools  direct marketing and other marketing efforts 
our sales and marketing efforts are directed at establishing and supporting our licensing relationships 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses comprise salaries  legal fees including those associated with the establishment and protection of our patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights which are integral to our business and expenses related to compliance with the reporting and other requirements of a publicly traded company including directors and officers liability insurance 
critical accounting polices and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our accounting estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results inevitably will differ from the estimates  and such differences may require material adjustments to our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon concluding that all of the fundamental criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
contract revenue includes technology license fees for currently available technology or engineering service fees for technology under development  and support and maintenance fees 
consistent with sab no 
 license fees are recorded as revenue upon the execution of the license agreement when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred and collectibility is probable 
we assess the credit worthiness of each customer at the time the license agreement is executed or when a transaction under the agreement occurs 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
fees related to engineering services contracts for technology under development  which contracts are performed on a best efforts basis  are recognized as revenue over the estimated development period using a cost based percentage of completion method limited to the amount of the milestone payments attained under each agreement 
upon the execution of each engineering services contract  we estimate the engineering resources required to complete the development effort 
we regularly review and  if necessary  revise the estimated cost of development  as the development effort is subject to change due to changes in engineering schedules  resource availability and in some instances deliverable requirements from the licensee or third parties 
to the extent the revised estimated costs of development are less than the original estimate  the engineering service fee recognized would be accelerated to the revised percentage of completion in the period in which the adjustment occurred 
conversely  if the revised estimated costs of development are more than the original estimate  the engineering service fee recognized would be adjusted to the revised percentage of completion in the period in which the adjustment occurred 
to date  changes in the estimated costs of development have not been significant and the impact of these changes to our revenue have been immaterial 
under our support and maintenance arrangements  we provide unspecified upgrades  bug fixes and technical support 
no other upgrades  products or other post contract support are provided 
these arrangements are renewable annually by the customer 
support and maintenance revenue is recognized at its fair value ratably over the period during which the obligation exists  typically months 
the fair value of any support and maintenance obligation is established based on the specified renewal rate for such support and maintenance and generally priced as a percentage of license fees 
accrued facilities restructuring costs 
in october  we exited our denmark research facility  and we recorded a restructuring charge in the second quarter of fiscal to reflect the anticipated costs of the restructuring 
among other things  the anticipated costs included lease charges that were based on assumptions about the estimated period to sublease the facilities and future rental income 
the sublease income estimate and the estimated period to sublease the facility entail a high level of management judgment 
market conditions have fluctuated greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates and the rental prices charged for comparable properties 
we expect that market conditions will continue to fluctuate in the future  and we assess these conditions on a quarterly basis 
we may be required to record significant additional charges in future periods if we revise our assumptions or if our actual experience in subleasing our denmark facility is not consistent with our assumptions 
if  in the future  it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  we would be required to record an additional charge which would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined  as was the case in the first quarter of fiscal conversely  if  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges  the reversal of this over accrual would be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs which would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets due to our history of net losses  difficulty in forecasting future results and belief that we cannot rely on projections of future taxable income to realize deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
future income tax expense will be reduced to the extent that we have sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of  or decrease in  our valuation allowance 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable or that the estimated useful life of the asset has changed 
in order to judge the carrying value of an asset or the remaining useful life of an asset  we make various assumptions about the value of the asset in the future 
this may include assumptions about future prospects for the products to which the asset relates and typically involves computations of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by these products 
if such assets are deemed impaired  an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized 
judgments and assumptions about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in business strategy and our internal forecasts 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as part of our restructuring activities  we determined that we would not seek to integrate into our product plans the developed technology we acquired from lexra  inc and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million  the remaining net book value of that asset 
research and development expense included million in fiscal and  in fiscal related to the accelerated amortization and depreciation of certain computer aided design tool and software assets whose estimated useful lives were reduced because of the restructuring actions announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we make estimates when we acquire businesses or acquire groups of assets for a single aggregate price 
the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  or ipr d 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition of a business and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives  generally to years  assigned to tangible and intangible assets  other than ipr d  impact future amortization expense  the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are subsequently revised in light of new circumstances  purchase price adjustments  which could impact future amortization of acquired assets  or asset impairment charges  could be required 
results of operation years ended june   and revenue 
total revenue consists of royalties and contract revenue 
royalties consisted of royalties from sales by licensees of products incorporating our technology and in fiscal primarily from sales of nintendo video cartridges 
contract revenue consisted of fees generated from new and existing license agreements for developed technology and engineering service fees generated from engineering services contracts for technology under development 
our revenues in fiscal  and were as follows in millions fiscal year fiscal year change in dollars change in percent change in dollars change in percent revenue royalties percentage of total revenue contract revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in fiscal revenue was primarily due to a increase in royalties 
a substantial majority of this increase resulted from royalties under license agreements signed since our initial public offering in june as customers under these agreements are shipping more products incorporating our technology 
contract revenue increased slightly as a total of new license agreements were completed in fiscal compared to agreements in fiscal resulting in an increase of million in fees for currently available technology 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease of million in fees generated from engineering services contracts for technology under development 
engineering service fees decreased because we had fewer agreements in place for the development of products than in the prior fiscal year 
fiscal compared to fiscal the decline in fiscal revenue was primarily due to a decrease of in contract revenue primarily because we entered into only new license agreements for developed technology  which is fewer than in fiscal  and the substantial majority of these new licenses were for our lower end mips k cores 
in both fiscal and fiscal  the license of more of our lower end mips k cores was due to new versions of these products becoming available for license at the beginning of fiscal and  we believe  to customer s preferences for a lowest priced solution in the then current economic environment 
the decline in royalties was due to a decrease in royalties of million from nintendo products offset in part by an increase in royalties from new customers shipping products incorporating our technology 
cost and expenses 
our cost and expenses in fiscal  and were as follows in millions fiscal year fiscal year change in dollars change in percent change in dollars change in percent cost and expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative cost of contract revenue 
cost of contract revenue was zero in fiscal and  in each of fiscal and and was attributable to sublicense fees 
we believe that future cost of contract revenue will continue to be immaterial in relation to total revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in salary and benefits expense of million  a decrease in computer aided design tool amortization expense of million  and a decrease in depreciation expense of  as a result of the restructuring actions implemented in which decreased our research and development staff by and included the closure of our denmark design center and the termination of our custom core team 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in bonus expense of million primarily due to the reinstatement of our executive bonus and profit sharing plans 
research and development expenses in fiscal included million related to the accelerated amortization and depreciation of certain computer aided design tools and software assets whose estimated useful lives were reduced because of our restructuring plans announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal research and development expenses in fiscal decreased primarily due to a decrease in salary expense of million caused by the closure of our denmark design center in december  offset in part by additional salary expense of  from our design center in the united kingdom  which we acquired during the first quarter of fiscal research and development expenses in fiscal included  related to the accelerated amortization and depreciation of certain computer aided design tools and software assets whose estimated useful lives were reduced because of our restructuring plans announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal our research and development staff declined to persons at june  following the termination of our custom core development efforts at the end of the first quarter of fiscal from persons at june   and persons at june  we expect our research and development expenses to increase in fiscal as we invest in additional projects to support our growth 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense decreased in fiscal primarily due to a decrease of million in salary expense resulting from our fiscal restructuring actions  and a decrease of  in marketing expense due to reduced spending on marketing projects and events 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to reduced spending of million on third party software development tools 
this decrease is due to our commitment of internal resources to development of third party software development tools and a decrease in compensation expense of  due to lower headcount 
we incur expenses related to third party software development tools when we enter into agreements with tool vendors to develop software tools that are compatible with our products such as compilers  debuggers  probes and operating systems 
expenses associated with third party tools are typically driven by the third party s attainment of specified milestones and vary from period to period 
our commitments at june  under these agreements are immaterial 
our sales and marketing staff was persons at june  compared to persons at june  and decreased from persons at june  as a result of restructuring actions taken during fiscal we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in fiscal as we focus additional resources on expanding our market presence 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal were flat compared to fiscal during fiscal there was an increase in bonus and profit sharing of million offset primarily by decreases in salary of  due to fewer headcount  director and officer insurance premium of approximately  and the reversal of a bad debt allowance of  as we were able to collect an outstanding receivable that had previously been determined to be uncollectable 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal primarily due to an increase in our directors and officers insurance premium 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase in fiscal in process research and development 
in july  we completed the acquisition of algorithmics limited  a united kingdom based tool chain company  and an affiliated company  dfs limited  for cash and stock consideration 
we recorded a charge in fiscal of  for purchased in process research and development expenses upon completion of the acquisition because technological feasibility of the acquired technology had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
the fair value of the projects was determined by estimating the present value of the net cash flows we believed would result from the acquired technology 
in december  we acquired from lexra  inc certain technology related to our processor architectures and cores  and we recorded a charge in fiscal of million for purchased in process research and development expenses upon acquisition of the technology 
the amount allocated to in process research and development was expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses for the technology existed 
the value of the projects was determined by estimating the present value of the net cash flows management believed would result from the acquired technology 
restructuring charge 
restructuring expense of million in fiscal consisted of million related to the restructuring action announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal which included the termination of our custom core team in september and million of additional expense based upon our revised estimate of sublease income during the remainder of the lease term related to our denmark design center facilities from the october restructuring action 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce our operating expenses 
the plan included the termination of approximately employees and contractors or approximately one third of our workforce 
these activities resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which primarily consisted of million in employee severance costs 
all employees and contractors had been terminated under this plan as of june  and all costs had been paid 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we closed our denmark design center to consolidate our research and development activities in our headquarters in california and in our then recently acquired design center in the united kingdom 
we implemented plans to eliminate regular positions  or about of our then global workforce  across all functions with the objective of reducing our operating expenses 
these activities resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately million 
the restructuring charge included approximately million of employee severance and related benefits  million in asset write offs  million of facilities exit costs  primarily related to lease expenses net of anticipated sublease income  and  in legal and other costs 
the restructuring charge in fiscal of  is comprised of employee severance and benefit payments in which we eliminated regular positions  or about of our global workforce  with the objective of reducing our operating expenses to be more in line with our revenue projections 
all of the severance and benefit costs associated with the positions eliminated were paid by january other income  net 
other income  net in fiscal  and were as follows in thousands years ended june  interest income   interest expense loss on investment  other other income  net  the declines in interest income in fiscal and are primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our short term investments and cash equivalents and lower cash and investment balances 
the loss on investment in fiscal reflects the impairment charge we recorded in december related to the full value of our equity investment in lexra  inc income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million in fiscal consisting primarily of foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
in fiscal  we recorded a provision of million consisting primarily of foreign income taxes and foreign withholding taxes and the recording of a full valuation against our deferred tax assets offset by federal tax refunds due to net operation loss carryback claims 
in fiscal  we recorded a benefit provision for income taxes of  the tax benefit for differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the foreign losses that did not provide a tax benefit 
a certain transaction reported in our federal income tax return for fiscal year is currently under examination by the internal revenue service 
no adjustment as been proposed at this time 
we believe that adequate amounts have been provided for any adjustment that may ultimately result from this examination 
impact of currency certain of our international licensees pay royalties based on revenues that are reported in a local currency and translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect when such revenues are reported by the licensee 
to date  substantially all of our revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that sales by our manufacturing licensees are denominated in foreign currencies  royalties we receive on such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  an increase of million from june   and we had working capital of million 
our principal requirements for cash are to fund working capital needs  and  to a lesser extent  capital expenditures for equipment purchases  licensing of computer aided design tools used in our development activities  acquisition of technologies and patents 
in fiscal  we primarily generated cash from operations and we used cash primarily for investing activities 
the following table summarizes selected items in thousands from our statement of cash flows for fiscal  and for complete statements of cash flows for those periods  see the financial statements in item years ended june  net cash provided by used in operating activities   net loss    depreciation    write off of investment in privately held company  amortization of intangibles    accounts receivable   prepaid expenses   other assets   other current accrued liabilities   income tax payable   accrued compensation  net cash provided by used in investing activities net maturities purchases of short term investments   capital expenditures    purchase of intangible assets   acquisition of algorithmics limited and an affiliated company  dfs limited  net  purchase of investment in privately held company  net cash provided by financing activities net proceeds from issuance of common stock    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal  our operating activities generated cash of million due to our net loss of million offset by non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of intangibles 
in addition  cash was generated from the decrease in accounts receivable due to collections and timing of licensing agreements along with a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets due to amortization on our computer aided design time based licenses offset in part by a decrease in other current accrued liabilities due to final payments made under our may restructuring action 
the increase in accrued compensation is primarily due to profit sharing and executive bonus to be paid after the end of the fiscal year 
for fiscal  our operating activities used cash of million primarily due to our net loss of million 
this was offset in part by non cash charges from deprecation and amortization of intangibles along with the million write off of our equity investment in privately held lexra  inc in addition  there was a decrease in accounts receivable due to fewer licensing agreements completed at the end of fiscal  and decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets due to income tax refunds received along with an increase in our valuation allowance to fully offset our deferred tax assets due to lower likelihood of utilization of the future benefit 
other current accrued liabilities increased due to the unpaid restructuring activities at the end of the fiscal year 
for fiscal  our operating activities used cash of million due to our net loss of million  offset in part by non cash charges from depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
in addition  cash decreased due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and decreases in other accrued liabilities  accrued compensation and income taxes payable 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to an increase in prepaid maintenance for computer aided design tools  an increase in income taxes receivable pertaining to certain tax credits and refunds applied for  and increased prepaid insurance 
the increase in other assets is due to an increasing number of our computer aided design tools  which represents software used to develop our intellectual property  are now secured through term licenses of three to seven years 
these licenses are recorded in other assets and amortized over the term of the license 
in the past  the majority of our tools were acquired through the purchases of perpetual licenses  which were recorded as capital assets under equipment 
in addition  cash decreased due to a decrease in income taxes payable resulting from our net loss and tax payments made during the year  and a decrease in accrued compensation due to lower accrued bonuses 
for fiscal  net cash used by investing activities was million primarily due to net purchases of short term investments and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities was  in fiscal due to net maturities on short term investments offset by capital expenditures  the purchase of intangible assets and the acquisition of algorithmics  ltd 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal primarily due to net purchases of short term investments  capital expenditures  the purchases of intangible assets and a small equity investment in lexra  inc net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for all periods presented consisted primarily of net proceeds to us from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plans 
this was partially offset in fiscal by the payment of the mortgage loan of  acquired as a result of the acquisition of algorithmics  ltd 
during the fiscal year 
our future liquidity and capital requirements could vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending on numerous factors  including  among others the cost  timing and success of product development efforts  the level and timing of contract revenues and royalties  the cost of maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and other litigation  level and timing of restructuring activities  and whether we complete any acquisitions 
we believe that we have sufficient cash to meet our projected operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may in the future be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to holders of our common stock  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
moreover  strategic relationships  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require that we relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of june  were as follows payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations     purchase obligations   other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet under gaap total     we lease office facilities under noncancelable operating leases that expire through in connection with the lease  we have entered into a letter of credit as a security deposit with a financial institution for  which is guaranteed by a time based certificate of deposit 
outstanding purchase orders for ongoing operations 
payments of these obligations are subject to the provision of services or products 
long term liability to employees under a deferred compensation plan 
distributions under this plan are elected by the employees 
factors that may affect our business our success is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below 
these factors could hinder our growth  cause us to sustain losses or have other adverse effects on us  all of which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations that could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly financial results may vary significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
in addition  our revenue components are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
because our expenses are largely independent of our revenue in any particular period  it is difficult to accurately forecast our operating results 
our operating expenses are based  in part  on anticipated future revenue and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenue is below expectations in any quarter  the adverse effect may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for the revenue shortfall 
therefore  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock may fall 
factors that could cause our revenue and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter include our ability to identify attractive licensing opportunities and then enter into new licensing agreements on terms that are acceptable to us  the financial terms and delivery schedules of our contractual arrangements with our licensees  which may provide for significant up front payments  payments based on the achievement of certain milestones or extended payment terms  the relative mix of contract revenue and royalties  the demand for products that incorporate our technology  our ability to develop  introduce and market new processor intellectual property  the establishment or loss of licensing relationships with semiconductor companies or digital consumer and business product manufacturers  the timing of new products and product enhancements by us and our competitors  changes in development schedules  research and development expenditure levels and product support by us and semiconductor companies and digital consumer and business product manufacturers  and uncertain economic and market conditions 
the success of our business depends on maintaining and growing our contract revenue 
contract revenue consists of technology license fees paid for access to our developed technology and engineering service fees related to technology under development 
our ability to secure the licenses from which our contract revenues are derived depends on our customers  including semiconductor companies  digital consumer and business product manufacturers  adopting our technology and using it in the products they sell 
our contract revenue declined in fiscal and fiscal and increased by in fiscal while we expect that we will continue to grant additional licenses to new licensees and develop new products to license to both new and existing licensees  we cannot predict whether we can maintain our current contract revenue levels or if contract revenue will grow 
our licensees are not obligated to license new or future generations of our products  so past contract revenue may not be indicative of the amount of such revenue in any future period 
if we cannot maintain or grow our contract revenue or if our customers do not adopt our technology and obtain corresponding licenses  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
we depend on royalties from the sale of products incorporating our technology  and we have limited visibility as to the timing and amount of such sales 
our receipt of royalties from our licenses depends on our customers incorporating our technology into their products  their bringing these products to market  and the success of these products 
in the case of our semiconductor customers  we are further dependent upon the sale of products by their customers 
thus  our ability to achieve design wins and enter into licensing agreements does not assure us of future revenue 
any royalties that we are eligible to receive are based on the sales of products incorporating the semiconductors or other products of our licensees  and as a result we do not have direct access to information that will help us anticipate the timing and amount of future royalties 
factors that negatively affect our licensees and their customers could adversely affect our business 
the success of our direct and indirect customers is subject to a number of factors  including the competition these companies face and the market acceptance of their products  the engineering  marketing and management capabilities of these companies and technical challenges unrelated to our technology that they face in developing their products  and their financial and other resources 
because we do not control the business practices of our licensees and their customers  we have little influence on the degree to which our licensees promote our technology and do not set the prices at which products incorporating our technology are sold 
if we don t compete effectively in the market for embedded processors  our business will be adversely affected 
competition in the market for embedded processors is intense 
our products compete with those of other designers and developers of processors and cores  as well as those of semiconductor manufacturers whose product lines include processors for embedded and non embedded applications 
in addition  we may face competition from the producers of unauthorized mips based clones and other technology designs 
the market for embedded processors has recently faced downward pricing pressures on products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressure will not materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in order to be successful in marketing our products to semiconductor companies  we must differentiate our processors  cores and related designs from those available or under development by the internal design groups of these companies  including some of our current and prospective licensees 
many of these internal design groups have substantial engineering and design resources and are part of larger organizations with substantial financial and marketing resources 
these internal design groups may develop products that compete with ours 
some of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases as well as greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
this may allow them to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
it may also allow them to devote greater resources than we can to the development and promotion of their technologies and products 
we depend on design wins to expand our revenue base 
our ability to generate royalties is uncertain and depends in large part on whether our processors and related designs are selected by our licensees and their customers for design  which we refer to as design wins  into a broader range of both digital consumer and business products 
our ability to achieve design wins is subject to several risks and uncertainties  including the potentially limited opportunities for design wins with respect to certain digital consumer products  such as video game products or digital television set top boxes  due to a limited number of product manufacturers and the length of product life cycles  the risk that the performance  functionality  price and power characteristics of our designs may not satisfy those that are critical to specific digital consumer and business product applications  and our failure to identify and respond in a timely manner to trends and emerging markets for embedded processors 
even if our technology is incorporated into new products  we cannot be certain that any such products will ultimately be brought to market  achieve commercial acceptance or generate meaningful royalties for us 
our ability to achieve design wins may be limited unless we are able to develop enhancements and new generations of our intellectual property 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to develop enhancements and new generations of our processors  cores and other intellectual property that satisfy the requirements of specific product applications and introduce these new technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  or if the characteristics of our processor  core and related designs are not compatible with the requirements of specific product applications  our ability to achieve design wins may be limited 
our failure to achieve a significant number of design wins would adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
technical innovations of the type critical to our success are inherently complex and involve several risks  including our ability to anticipate and timely respond to changes in the requirements of semiconductor companies  and original equipment manufacturers  or oems  of digital consumer and business products  our ability to anticipate and timely respond to changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes  changing customer preferences in the digital consumer and business products markets  the emergence of new standards in the semiconductor industry and for digital consumer and business products  the significant investment in a potential product that is often required before commercial viability is determined  and the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
our failure to adequately address these risks could render our existing processor  core and related designs obsolete and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will have the financial and other resources necessary to develop processor  core and related designs in the future  or that any enhancements or new generations of the technology that we develop will generate revenue sufficient to cover or in excess of the costs of development 
we depend on our key personnel to succeed 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key management  technical  sales and marketing personnel  many of whom are highly skilled and difficult to replace 
we cannot assure you that we will retain our key officers and employees 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly those with significant experience in the semiconductor and processor design industries  remains intense 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could make it difficult to meet key objectives  such as timely and effective project milestones and product introductions which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our recent restructurings may have an adverse effect on employee morale and create concern among existing employees about job security and  as a result  key employees may be more likely to seek other employment opportunities 
changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries with low statutory tax rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws 
in addition  we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service regarding our federal income tax return for fiscal year although no adjustment has been proposed at this time and we believe that adequate amounts have been provided for any adjustment that may ultimately result from this examination  the outcome of the examination is currently unclear 
we operate in countries other than the united states and occasionally face inquiries and examinations regarding tax matters in these countries 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from our current examination or any other examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we may encounter difficulties with future acquisitions  which could harm our business 
as part of our business strategy  in the future we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses or technologies that we believe can complement or expand our business  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
any future acquisitions may require debt or equity financing  or the issuance of shares in the transaction  any of which could increase our leverage or be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
we may incur charges related to acquisitions or investments that are completed 
for instance  we recorded an in process research and development charge in the first quarter of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal as a result of our acquisition of certain technology 
we will also face challenges integrating acquired businesses and operations and assimilating and managing the personnel of the acquired operations 
geographic distances may further complicate the difficulties of this integration 
the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business 
acquisitions involve a number of other risks and challenges  including diversion of management s attention  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies  exposure to unanticipated contingent liabilities of acquired companies  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition and or operate the acquired business 
any of these and other factors could harm our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition 
our intellectual property may be misappropriated and we may be unable to obtain or enforce intellectual property rights 
policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our technologies  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
as part of our business strategy  we license our technology in multiple geographies including in countries whose laws do not provide as much protection for our intellectual property as the laws of the united states and where we may not be able to enforce our rights 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent other parties from designing and marketing unauthorized mips based products or that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire the same or substantially equivalent technologies as ours 
moreover  cross licensing arrangements  in which we license certain of our patents but do not generally transfer know how or other proprietary information  may facilitate the ability of cross licensees  either alone or in conjunction with others  to develop competitive products and designs 
we also cannot assure you that any of our patent applications to protect our intellectual property will be approved 
in addition  effective trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain countries 
if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights  our technology may be used without the payment of license fees and royalties  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our operating results and increase the likelihood of costly litigation 
we may be subject to claims of infringement 
we cannot assure you that any of the patents or other intellectual property rights that we own or use will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by others or be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage 
significant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in our industry 
as we grow our business and expand into new markets that other companies are developing in  the risk that our technology may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others increases 
we cannot be certain that third parties will not make a claim of infringement against us  our licensees  or our licensees customers in connection with use of our technology 
any claims  even those without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
these royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms to us or at all 
a successful claim of infringement against us or one of our licensees in connection with its use of our technology could adversely affect our business 
we have recorded long lived assets  and our results of operations would be adversely affected if their value becomes impaired 
in both the first and second quarters of fiscal and the second quarter of fiscal  we acquired certain core and developed technologies and patent and patent applications  and the purchase price of these long lived assets is being amortized over schedules based on their useful lives 
if we complete additional acquisitions in the future  our purchased intangible assets amortization charge could increase  and we may be required to record substantial amounts of goodwill 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including purchased assets  for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million for purchased developed technology acquired in december we recorded additional research and development expense of million in fiscal and  in fiscal related to the accelerated amortization and depreciation of certain computer aided design tool and software assets whose estimated useful lives were reduced because of the restructuring actions announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the future  if we determine that our long lived assets are impaired  we will have to recognize additional charges for this impairment 
we cannot be sure that we will not be required to record additional long lived asset impairment charges in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on investments of our excess cash 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
to achieve this objective and minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we invest in high quality short term maturity commercial paper  municipal bonds  and money market funds operated by reputable financial institutions in the united states 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that we do not have a material interest rate risk exposure 
we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because a substantial portion of our revenue has been  and is expected to continue to be  derived from customers outside the united states 
to date  substantially all of our revenue from international customers has been denominated in us dollars 
because we cannot predict the amount of non us dollar denominated revenue earned by our licensees  we have not historically attempted to mitigate the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our revenue  and we do not presently intend to do so in the future
