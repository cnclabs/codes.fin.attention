item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company has two reportable operating segments  the recreational vehicle products segment the rv segment and the manufactured housing products segment the mh segment 
the rv segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for  manufactures a variety of products used in the production of recreational vehicles  including windows  doors  chassis  chassis parts  rv slide out mechanisms and related power units  and electric stabilizer jacks 
the mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales in  manufactures a variety of components used in the construction of manufactured homes  and to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens  chassis  chassis parts and thermo formed bath and shower units 
this shift in sales between segments resulted partly from the growth in the rv industry and the decline in the mh industry 
intersegment sales and sales to industries other than manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes are insignificant 
the company s operations are conducted through its operating subsidiaries 
its two primary operating subsidiaries  kinro  inc kinro and lippert components  inc lci  have operations in both the mh and rv segments 
at december   the company s subsidiaries operated plants in states and one in canada 
industry background recreational vehicle industry the recreational vehicle industry association rvia reported a three percent increase in total industry shipments of recreational vehicles rvs in  while industry shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs only  the company s primary market  increased nine percent for the growth builds upon  when the rvia reported an increase of percent in total rv shipments to near record levels and an increase of percent for travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs for the year 
increasing industry rv sales are expected to continue to be driven by positive demographics  as demand for rvs is strongest from the over age group  which is the fastest growing segment of the population 
industry growth also continues to be bolstered by the preference for domestic vacations  rather than foreign travel  and low interest rates 
in recent years  the rvia has employed an advertising campaign to attract customers in the to age group  and the number of rv s owned by those to grew faster than all other age groups 
manufactured housing industry as a result of limited credit availability for purchases of manufactured homes  high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages on site built homes and chattel loans for manufactured homes  and unusually high repossessions of manufactured homes  industry production has declined approximately percent since to  homes in  the lowest production level in years 
however  based upon industry reports  retail sales of manufactured homes have declined much less severely to an estimated  homes in however  almost percent of these retail sales have been filled by inventory reductions by dealers and manufacturers  and the resale of repossessed homes  rather than new production 
it has been estimated that approximately  manufactured homes per year were repossessed in to  with estimates of  or more homes repossessed in  far in excess of historical repossession levels 
repossessions and the limited availability of chattel loans for home buyers have been continuing concerns for the manufactured housing industry 
however  recently there have been some signs that repossessions are beginning to ease and the retail inventory of new and repossessed homes per retail dealer location has declined from december levels 
the availability of financing for manufactured homes is expected to increase in as a result of fannie mae s announcement in february that they were easing their financing requirements for manufactured homes 
in addition  berkshire hathaway inc acquired clayton homes in august  and clayton has since received substantial funds to provide financing for manufactured homes 
long term prospects for manufactured housing are still favorable because it provides quality  affordable housing which the country needs 
as a result of market share gains and efficiency improvements  drew s mh segment has remained profitable throughout this extended industry wide slump 
based upon the company s current sales content per manufactured home  the company has estimated that for every  new manufactured homes produced  the company s net sales should increase approximately million  and the operating profit on the incremental sales should be higher than current segment operating margins 
steel prices in mid december and continuing into  the company was notified by its steel suppliers of unprecedented steel cost increases  which through february have aggregated more than percent 
steel is one of the company s primary raw materials 
this situation apparently arose as the result of an increase in world wide steel demand  particularly in china 
in addition  due to the weakened value of the united states dollar  which has declined about percent versus the euro over the last year  and the increased cost of oceanic shipping  it has become uneconomical to import steel 
in response to the steel cost increases  the company took the following immediate actions a contacted other steel vendors  both domestic and foreign  in an attempt to obtain better pricing  but to no avail  b ordered as much steel as possible in december  and january and february  before the monthly cost increases became effective in each month  c raised prices to customers  which was followed with a second round of price increases  and d cut operating costs wherever possible 
these actions were taken quickly and as a result  the steel cost increases to date are not expected to have a significant effect on results 
results of operations net sales and operating profit are as follows in thousands year ended december  net sales rv segment    mh segment    total    operating profit rv segment    mh segment    amortization of intangibles  corporate and other    total    net sales and operating profit by segment  as a percent of the total  are as follows year ended december  net sales rv segment mh segment total operating profit rv segment mh segment amortization of intangibles corporate and other total year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights income from continuing operations was up percent in  to a record million 
operating profit margin increased to for  from percent in net sales grew by percent 
on october  the company completed the acquisition of indiana based et t frames  inc et t  a manufacturer of specialty chassis and towable rv chassis products with annual sales of approximately million  for million 
on july  the company completed the acquisition of kansas based ltm manufacturing  llc ltm  a manufacturer of innovative rv products with annual sales of approximately million  for million 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment increased million percent from  largely due to increases in the company s market share of all its primary rv product lines  including rv slide out mechanisms and related power units  chassis  and windows and doors 
sales of rv slide out mechanisms and related power units doubled from  to approximately million 
the growth of this segment also resulted from the industry wide growth in rv shipments  in particular the company s primary market of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  as well as the continued trend towards using more slide out mechanisms in travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
long term growth in industry wide rv sales may result from demographic trends  as demand for rvs is strongest from the over age population  which is the fastest growing segment of the population  although rv sales may be subject to periodic swings 
there were no significant changes in sales prices by the company s rv segment in the acquisitions of ltm and et t  completed in  added only approximately million in sales in  but have substantial growth potential to exceed their combined pre acquisition annual historical sales of approximately million 
recently  the company s research and development departments designed and developed new products such as leveling systems and slide out mechanisms for motor homes  and bath and shower units for rvs 
the company plans to aggressively market these products in for  the company only had minimal sales to the motor home segment of the rv industry 
operating profit of the rv segment increased million percent in over this growth is attributable to both an increase in unit sales and an increase in the segment s operating profit margin 
operating profit margin increased to percent for from percent in primarily because of i the spreading of fixed costs over higher sales  ii greater purchasing leverage for certain components  iii improved operating efficiencies  and iv temporarily moderate steel costs during the middle of the company was notified by its steel suppliers of unprecedented steel cost increases which began in late and accelerated in  and have now aggregated more than percent as described in industry background above 
partially offsetting these increases in operating profit margin were legal and other costs related to the settlement of patent litigation on the company s slide out mechanisms in february and higher health and workers compensation insurance costs 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment declined million percent in  which was less of a decline than that experienced by the industry as a whole 
the company has captured market share and increased sales of products for modular homes and office units partially offsetting the sales reduction caused by the decline in industry shipments 
there were no significant changes in sales prices by the company s mh segment during operating profit of the mh segment decreased million percent in largely because of the decline in sales 
this segment s operating profit margin was percent of sales in  which was slightly lower than the percent achieved for  primarily because of higher health and workers compensation insurance costs and the negative impact of lower volume on fixed costs  partially offset by temporarily moderate steel costs during the middle of the company was notified by its steel suppliers of unprecedented steel cost increases which began in late and accelerated in  and have now aggregated more than percent as described in industry background above 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were down in dollar terms following the trend of sales 
as of november   the company evaluated the fair value of the goodwill associated with the mh segment  which had a book value of million  and determined that no impairment had occurred 
the company will continue to monitor such goodwill in light of conditions in the mh industry 
corporate and other corporate and other expenses increased  primarily as a result of higher directors and officers insurance costs  incentive compensation due to increased profits  stock option expense resulting from the adoption of sfas  expenses associated with the listing of the company s stock on the new york stock exchange  and expenses related to corporate governance due to the implementation of the sarbanes oxley requirements 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  rv segment the rv segment achieved a percent net sales increase in  as a result of industry growth and a significant increase in the market share of both its rv chassis and its rv window and door product lines 
in addition  the introduction of slide out mechanisms and related components to the rv chassis product line was a major contribution to the segment s sales increase  accounting for sales of approximately percent of segment net sales 
the sales gains of the rv segment far exceeded the percent increase in industry wide shipments of rv s in in august  the company acquired the business and certain assets of the rv chassis division of elkhart  indiana based quality frames  inc  with chassis sales of approximately million 
production of these chassis was moved to the company s existing manufacturing facilities 
in addition  the company is also selling other products to these new customers 
operating profit of the rv segment increased million percent in over this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in sales 
the segment s profit margin increased to percent for from percent for  primarily because of the effect of fixed costs and higher sales as well as improved operating efficiencies of this fast growing segment  which more than offset the effect of the higher steel costs experienced in the second half of there were no significant selling price increases in and mh segment net sales of the mh segment increased percent in  despite the percent decline in industry wide production of manufactured homes 
excluding sales of the better bath operation  acquired in june  sales of this segment increased percent in the company outperformed the industry primarily because of market share gains from sales of its high end vinyl window products 
in early october  the company expanded its capacity in order to accommodate the increased demand for these vinyl window products 
the operating profit margin of the mh segment increased slightly to percent in from percent in the results were enhanced by the improved operating profit margin achieved by better bath  partially as a result of reduced product costs  and lower selling  general and administrative costs 
this improvement in operating profit margins by better bath  was partially offset by substantial increases in certain steel costs  primarily as a result of new import tariffs 
steel costs in early remain significantly higher than during the comparable period in the company has had some success in passing a portion of these increases on to its customers 
also  labor costs increased on the company s fast growing vinyl window product line as a result of capacity constraints  which have been alleviated by the addition of a new production line in alabama  opened in october higher sales caused selling  general and administrative expenses to increase  but such costs were stable as a percentage of sales 
included in selling  general and administrative costs in is a charge of million relating to the chapter filing of oakwood homes 
as of december   the company had fully reserved the million pre bankruptcy receivable from this customer 
the company continues to sell to oakwood homes pursuant to authorization of the bankruptcy court 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased  in from  primarily as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but rather be tested for impairment at least annually 
the following schedule shows pro forma income for the year ended december   excluding goodwill amortization expense in thousands  except per share data year ended december  net income earnings per share basic diluted income from continuing operations  as reported  goodwill amortization expense  net of taxes  

pro forma income from continuing operations  corporate and other corporate and other expenses for the year  were  higher than last year  as a result of increases in incentive compensation based upon higher profits  higher professional fees for special projects  a new investor relations program  and increased insurance and benefit costs 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill during the first quarter of  in accordance with the goodwill impairment provisions of sfas no 
 the company identified its reporting units and allocated its assets and liabilities  including goodwill  to its reporting units 
in addition  the company had a valuation of certain of its reporting units done by an independent appraiser  as of january   to assist the company in determining if there had been an impairment in the goodwill of any of such reporting units 
based on this appraisal and additional analyses performed by the company  it was determined that there had been an impairment of goodwill in two reporting units 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of  offset by a tax benefit of  such charge has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
a substantial portion of the impairment charge related to the acquisition of lci 
at the time of that acquisition  lci was primarily involved in the mh segment  and was just beginning its rv products business 
since that time the mh industry has declined substantially causing a reduction in lci s mh sales and profits 
during the same period  lci s rv business has grown very substantially in both sales and profits 
as of november   the company reevaluated the fair value of the remaining goodwill  which had a book value of million  and determined that no additional impairment had occurred 
interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased million to million in  as a result of reductions in debt levels  and to a lesser extent  savings resulting from interest rate reductions 
the interest expense for also includes  related to imputed interest on the liability recorded for minimum royalty payments for fiscal years through interest expense  net decreased million to million in  as a result of reductions in debt levels 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for was approximately  compared to in and in the decline in the effective tax rate is due to a change in the composition of pretax income for state tax purposes 
discontinued operations the axle and tire refurbishing business of lta did not perform well from through  primarily due to increased competition and the decline in the manufactured housing industry  which severely affected operating margins 
in january  the axle and tire refurbishing business closed two of its five factories and in july  a third such operation was sold 
in september  the company converted one of its two remaining axle and tire refurbishing facilities to an rv window production facility 
the last axle and tire refurbishing operation was sold in january at a small gain 
as a result  the axle and tire refurbishing business of lta is classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets adopted by the company effective january  lta continues to own a factory in texas which was previously utilized in its axle and tire refurbishing business 
this factory is being leased to the purchaser of lta s texas operation 
since it is not probable that this factory will be sold within one year  it is not considered as held for sale under sfas no  and is not included in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
the proceeds from the disposition of all other significant assets of lta s axle and tire refurbishing business  consisting primarily of inventory and accounts receivable  were collected in january and resulted in a small gain 
the discontinued axle and tire refurbishing business had previously been included in the company s mh segment  and had revenues of million and million  in and  respectively 
recently adopted and new accounting standards as of april   the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options contained in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is considered the preferable method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
during the transition period  the company will be utilizing the prospective method under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures 
all employee stock options granted after january  have been expensed over the stock option vesting period based on fair value  determined using the black scholes option pricing method  at the date the options were granted 
this resulted in a  and  charge to operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  relating to options for  and  shares granted in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
historically  the company had applied the disclosure only option of sfas no 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized for stock options granted prior to january  had the company previously adopted this new accounting policy  diluted earnings per share would have been reduced by 
for  
for and 
for in august  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires companies to record a liability for asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
such liabilities should be recorded at fair value in the period in which a legal obligation is created  which typically would be upon acquisition or completion of construction 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january  the implementation of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the earnings or the financial position of the company 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of a guarantee  that is  the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
fin also requires additional disclosures related to guarantees 
the recognition measurement provisions of fin are effective for all guarantees entered into or modified after december  fin also requires additional disclosures related to guarantees in interim and annual financial statements 
accordingly  the company adopted the provisions of fin  effective january  the implementation of fin did not have an impact on the earnings or the financial position of the company 
liquidity and capital resources the statements of cash flows reflect the following in thousands year ended december  net cash flows provided by operating activities   net cash flows used for investing activities   net cash flows used for financing activities   cash flows from operations net cash flows from operating activities increased approximately million in  as a result of a million increase in income from continuing operations  as well as a a smaller increase in accounts receivable for the increase in accounts receivable was lower than  even though sales were higher in  due to a reduction in the days sales outstanding in receivables to approximately days 
this was due to the timing of collections 
b a decline in inventories this year  excluding the effect of business acquisitions  compared to an increase in inventories in the prior year 
the decline in the current year resulted from a concerted effort by management to reduce inventories at all locations  as well as strategic buying of certain raw materials at december  the inventory decrease is substantially all in raw materials  as there was only approximately a two week supply of finished goods on hand at december  and the impact of the rise in steel prices on inventory and the company s strategic buying of steel before the steel price increases took effect  did not impact inventory until c a decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets compared to an increase in the prior year 
the decline in was primarily due to the utilization of prepaid federal income taxes and an escrow deposit  both of which were uses of cash in d the above items were partially offset by a smaller increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
this change is primarily from the timing of payments and purchases at the end of trade payables are generally paid within the discount period 
net cash flows from operating activities declined approximately million in  despite the million increase in income before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill 
the lower net cash flows from operating activities in the current year is primarily attributable to a an increase in accounts receivable due to the increase in sales over the prior year 
days sales outstanding of receivables were the same at december as they were at december b an increase in inventories this year compared to a decline in inventories in the prior year 
inventories at december  are up percent from december  compared to a percent increase in sales in the fourth quarter 
the difference is partially attributable to strategic buying of certain raw materials 
the inventory increase is substantially all in raw materials  there is only approximately a two week supply of finished goods on hand at december   and december  c the above items were partially offset by the increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulting primarily from the timing of payment due dates and purchases

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets include certain deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recording of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
stock options as of april   the company adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options contained in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is considered the preferable method of accounting for stock options 
as a result  the fair value of all employee stock options granted after january  is being charged against earnings over the period of time during which the options vest 
to determine fair value  the company uses a method known as the black scholes option pricing method 
fair value is determined as of the date the option is granted 
the fair value of options granted before january  are not being charged against earnings since the company is using the prospective method  as allowed under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures 
in past years  the disclosure only option of sfas no 
was used 
therefore  no compensation cost was charged against earnings for stock options granted before january  if the company had charged compensation cost of options granted prior to january  to earnings  by using the prospective method under sfas no 
 net income loss would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below december  net income loss  as reported   add stock based employee compensation expense for stock options included in reported net income loss  net of related tax effects deduct total stock based employee compensation expense for stock options determined under fair value method for all stock option awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income loss    net income loss per common share basic as reported 
basic pro forma 
diluted as reported 
diluted pro forma 
other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business related to product returns  doubtful accounts  warranty obligations  lease terminations and asset retirement obligations  post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
inflation the prices of raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin  are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
the company experienced modest increases in its labor costs in and related to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk in the normal course of its operations due to its purchases of certain commodities and its financing activities 
certain raw materials  particularly steel  aluminum  vinyl  glass and abs resins are subject to price volatility 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing activities 
at december   the company had approximately million of fixed rate debt 
assuming there is a decrease of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings of a similar nature subsequent to december   which the company becomes unable to capitalize on in the short term as a result of the structure of its fixed rate financing  future cash flows would be approximately  lower per annum  than if the fixed rate financing could be obtained at current market prices 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings on its million line of credit 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt 
assuming there is an increase of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings under these variable rate loans subsequent to december   and outstanding borrowings of million  future cash flows would be affected by  per annum 
in addition  the company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of temporary investments in money market funds  however  such investing activity is not material to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
if the actual change in interest rates is substantially different than basis points  the net impact of interest rate risk on the company s cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above
