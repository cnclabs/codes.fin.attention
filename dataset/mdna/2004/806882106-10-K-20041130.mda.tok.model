item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates in three industry segments 
the company s metals recycling business collects  processes and recycles steel and other metals through its facilities 
the company s steel manufacturing business operates a mini mill near portland  oregon  which melts recycled metal  produces finished steel products and maintains one mill depot in southern california and one in central california 
the company s auto parts business purchases used and wrecked automobiles and allows retail customers the opportunity of extracting parts for purchase in its self service auto parts stores  with located in california  three in canada  two in nevada and one store in each of texas  utah  illinois and indiana 
additionally  the company is a non controlling partner in joint ventures that are either in the metals recycling business or are suppliers of unprocessed metals 
these joint ventures in the metals recycling business sell recycled metals that have been processed at their facilities processing and also buy and sell third parties processed metals brokering

form k critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost method 
the production and accounting process utilized by the company to record recycled metals inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
the company relies upon perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based upon historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of the estimates  the company not only runs periodic tests  but also performs monthly physical inventories 
physical inventories may detect significant variations in volume  but because of variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not generally detect smaller variations 
to mitigate this risk  the company adjusts it physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
in addition  the company establishes inventory reserves to further mitigate the risk of significant adjustments when determined reasonable 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both metals and finished steel products transfers upon shipment based on either cif or cif terms 
for retail sales by the company s auto parts business  revenues are recognized when customers pay for salvaged vehicle parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the customer location 
environmental costs the company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  the company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants 
these consultants and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
the company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established  and no other amount within the range is better than another  the minimum amount of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
adjustments to the liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to remediate 
in a number of cases  it is possible the company may receive reimbursement through prior insurance or from other potentially responsible parties identified in a claim 
in these situations  recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as an asset when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k goodwill in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and are required to assess goodwill for impairment at a minimum annually  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for impairment and the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
these tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by estimated future cash flows developed by management 
long lived assets we are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management 
the company s long lived assets primarily include property  plant and equipment used in operations 
taxes deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
periodically  the company reviews the deferred tax assets to assess whether the valuation allowances are necessary 
results of operations during fiscal  the company s operations improved dramatically  resulting in a record year for revenue and net income 
both the company s metals recycling business and steel manufacturing business recognized marked improvements over last year 
as well  the company s joint ventures in the metals recycling business benefited from rising selling prices to improve their profitability by 
in addition  the auto parts business contributed to earnings growth during the year 
the results of operations of the company depend in large part upon demand and prices for recycled metals in world markets and steel products in the western united states 
in fiscal  strong worldwide demand and a limited supply of recycled metals drove the metals recycling business average selling prices to all time highs 
market prices for recycled ferrous metals fluctuate periodically and have a significant impact on the results of operations for the wholly owned and joint ventures in the metals recycling business 
the steel manufacturing business saw significantly higher average selling prices and slightly higher sales volumes during fiscal compared with fiscal sales prices and volumes benefited from strong demand for steel products on the west coast of the united states  improvements in the us economy  and lower steel imports  which is partially attributed to the weakness of the us dollar and higher ocean freight rates 
the auto parts business segment was formed in the second quarter of fiscal as the result of an acquisition 
it purchases salvaged vehicles  sells parts from those vehicles through its retail facilities and wholesale operations and sells the remaining portion of the vehicles to metal recyclers 
the retail operations are somewhat seasonal and principally affected by weather conditions and promotional events 
since the stores are open to the natural elements  during periods of prolonged wet  cold or extreme heat  the retail business tends to slow down due to the difficult customer working conditions 
as a result  the company s first and third fiscal quarters tend to generate the most retail sales and the second and fourth fiscal quarters are the slowest in terms of retail sales 
the auto parts business other primary source of revenue is the sale of scrap metal and other parts wholesale 
revenues for the wholesale product lines are principally affected by commodity prices and shipping schedules 
as mentioned earlier in the discussions regarding the metal schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k recycling business  recycled metal prices have increased dramatically over fiscal which positively affected the revenues and profits of the auto parts business 
in addition  the auto parts business completed an acquisition during fiscal which added three stores in canada to the original stores acquired in fiscal the following tables set forth information regarding the breakdown of revenues between the company s metals recycling business  steel manufacturing business and auto parts business  and the breakdown of operating income from the metals recycling business  the steel manufacturing business  the auto parts business  joint ventures  corporate and eliminations 
additional financial information relating to business segments is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenues year ended august  in millions metals recycling business ferrous nonferrous other recycled metals total auto parts business steel manufacturing business intercompany sales eliminations total operating income loss year ended august  in millions metals recycling business auto parts business steel manufacturing business jvs in the metals recycling business jv suppliers of metals corporate expense intercompany eliminations impairment and other nonrecurring charges operating income includes year end lifo adjustments that reduced operating income by million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expense for services that benefit all three business segments 
because of this unallocated expense  the operating income of each segment does not reflect the operating income the segment would have as a stand alone business 
ferrous recycled metal sales from the metals recycling business to the steel manufacturing business  and autobody sales from the auto parts business to the metals recycling business  are made at negotiated rates per ton that are intended to approximate market 
consequently  these intercompany sales produce intercompany profits  which are eliminated until the finished products are sold to third parties 
impairment and other nonrecurring charges related to the metals recycling business in fiscal and and to the auto parts business in fiscal the amounts are shown separately to assist in understanding the business financial results 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues increased million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal revenues in fiscal increased for all company businesses primarily as a result of increased prices and demand in the worldwide ferrous metals market  including the addition of new export customers located outside of china 
significant improvements in demand coupled with lower steel imports led to increases in selling prices for finished steel products sold by the steel manufacturing business 
the auto parts business benefited from the increased ferrous metals prices in its sales of autobodies 
in addition  the auto parts business acquired three retail locations in canada that added revenue and operating income to the segment 
metals recycling business the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  which is an increase of million 
ferrous revenues increased million to million as a result of higher average selling prices net of shipping cost average net selling prices  higher shipping costs billed to customers and a slight increase in the volume sold 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased per ton  or  to per ton which represents million of the revenue increase 
average export shipping costs increased over the prior year and represent million of the revenue increase 
in addition  ferrous sales volumes increased or  tons which represents million of the increase in ferrous revenue 
export volume is up over prior year 
moreover  over of our total ferrous sales were export shipments to asia in the last two fiscal years 
in fiscal  ferrous export sales to china decreased to of the total ferrous exports compared to more than in fiscal in addition  ferrous export sales to south korea increased to approximately of our total ferrous export sales in fiscal compared to of ferrous export sales in fiscal new customers in thailand and india purchased of our export sales volume in fiscal sales volume to the company s steel manufacturing business increased to  tons due to increased demand in this finished steel business 
nonferrous revenues increased million to million due primarily to higher average prices 
the average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal was per pound  an increase of per pound from fiscal auto parts business the auto parts business generated revenue of million  before intercompany eliminations  which is an increase of million or from prior year 
this increase is a result of higher wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for scrapped autobodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices and the march acquisition of three retail store locations in canada 
steel manufacturing business the steel manufacturing business generated revenues of million  which is an increase of million or from prior year 
sales prices increased per ton or which represents million of the increase and sales volumes increased which represents million of the revenue increase 
the increase in selling prices are a combination of increased demand and passing along rapidly rising raw materials and energy costs required in the production process 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold increased million or over the prior year 
cost of goods sold decreased as a percentage of revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is due to profit margin improvements at all of the company s business segments  led by the steel manufacturing business 
metals recycling business cost of goods sold for the metal recycling business increased million or to million 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit increased by million to million for the year 
the increase in gross profit was attributable to higher average net selling prices per ton 
compared with fiscal  the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k increased due primarily to higher purchase costs for unprocessed ferrous metals and higher export sales shipping costs 
generally  the change in the cost of unprocessed metal has a strong correlation to changes in the average selling price  however there is generally a delay in the timing between changes in net selling prices and the change in the cost of unprocessed metal 
thus  as selling prices rose compared with last year  so did the cost of unprocessed metal 
since purchase costs did not increase at the same rate as selling prices  we experienced significant increases in margins 
auto parts business the auto parts business cost of goods sold increased million or over the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of goods sold increased from to 
this increase was due to higher car purchase costs and increases in labor costs 
gross profit increased million or over the prior year due to increased revenue 
steel manufacturing business cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million or to million 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in fiscal decreased to from in fiscal the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is attributable to higher average selling prices  higher sales volumes and the receipt of the final million electrode price fixing settlement  offset by a million pension charge 
average cost of goods sold per ton increased per ton or compared to the prior fiscal year 
as this increase in cost of sales per ton was more than offset by the per ton increase in average net selling price  gross profit improved by million in fiscal compared to fiscal impairment and other nonrecurring charges 
during fiscal  the company s portland  oregon metals recycling facility embarked on a dock and loading facility renovation 
the renovation was suspended in fiscal when issues with the dock s substructure were detected 
upon review of new engineering designs focused on operational efficiency and safety specifications  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal to write off renovation costs incurred prior to the suspension 
in connection with the acquisition of the auto parts business  the company conducted an environmental due diligence investigation 
based upon new information obtained in this investigation  the joint venture accrued million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal for remediation costs at the auto parts business s store locations 
no environmental proceedings are pending at any of these sites 
operating income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business processing   brokering   joint venture suppliers of metals   operating income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals 
the increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices and higher volumes 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were million tons for the year ended schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k august  compared with million tons in the prior year 
the volume of ferrous metal brokered by the joint ventures increased to million tons in fiscal compared to million tons in the prior year  which came primarily from increased market share in mexico and latin america coupled with product line expansion into other scrap metal related commodities 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to per ton from per ton  due to the same worldwide supply and demand factors affecting the wholly owned metals recycling business 
in fiscal  the company s share of income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business increased to million due to higher average net selling prices  increased margins and more efficient operations  benefiting from similar market factors and pricing as described in the discussion above relating to the company s wholly owned metals recycling business 
the company s joint ventures with hugo neu corporation earned nearly all of this operating income 
the company s share of operating income from the global brokering joint venture increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the company s share of joint venture operating income in fiscal also included an estimated million from a joint venture contract with new york city for the processing and disposal of curbside recycling materials that commenced in april the contract with new york city is an interim contract  and the company s present intention is not to participate in the anticipated long tem contract  so the income stream from this contract could end at any time 
operating income in fiscal was reduced by million representing the company s share of the joint venture lifo inventory adjustment compared with a reduction of million in fiscal selling expenses 
selling expenses increased million over fiscal primarily due to increased advertising expenses in the auto parts business 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million over fiscal the higher general and administrative expenses were due to higher bonus expense as well as increased spending on sarbanes oxley compliance and professional fees 
the company s bonus plan is based upon the principles of economic value added eva and is directly tied to the financial performance of the company 
given the company s recent record financial performance  bonus expense is significantly higher in fiscal interest expense 
in fiscal  interest expense increased million compared to fiscal due to higher average debt balances during fiscal income tax provision 
the tax rate for fiscal compares with a tax rate of for fiscal the increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to a reduction in estimated extraterritorial income exclusion eti tax benefits on export sales  an increase partially offset by the reversal of the million deferred tax valuation allowance associated with net operating loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards 
the company s tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal due to a change in the tax law phasing out eti tax benefits over the next two years and the deferred tax valuation allowance being fully reversed 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
consolidated revenues increased million to million for fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for the metals recycling business increased due to higher selling prices and volumes as worldwide demand for ferrous metals strengthened through the year 
revenues for the steel manufacturing business also increased due to higher average net selling prices and increased sales volumes 
consolidated revenues also increased by million due to the addition of the auto parts business as a consolidated business 
the metals recycling business generated revenues of million  before intercompany eliminations  which is an increase of million 
ferrous revenues increased million to million as a result of an increase in tons sold and higher average selling prices net of shipping cost average net selling prices 
ferrous sales volumes increased  tons and the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased to per ton 
curtailed supplies of ferrous recycled metals from the countries of the former soviet union  growing worldwide demand and the weakness of the us dollar drove the volume and price increases 
in fiscal  the metals recycling business made export shipments aggregating million tons  an increase of  tons compared with fiscal domestic third party ferrous tonnage also increased by  tons to  tons 
sales to the company s steel manufacturing business increased to  tons due to increased demand in this business 
nonferrous revenues increased million to million due primarily to higher average prices 
the average net nonferrous selling price in fiscal was per pound  an increase of per pound from fiscal schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k the steel manufacturing business revenues increased million from revenues recognized in the prior year to million in fiscal primarily due to higher average net selling prices and higher volumes for all major product lines 
the volume of finished steel products sold increased  along with the average net selling price per ton  compared with fiscal sales of finished steel products were up to  tons while the average net selling price per ton increased per ton to per ton 
the increase in the average sales price per ton was primarily due to a higher valued product sales mix and lower supplies of competing importing steel  which was partially attributed to the weakness of the us dollar 
also  towards the end of the fiscal second quarter  the company and other steel producers increased their selling prices for rebar and coiled rebar 
additionally  merchant bar selling prices have increased modestly to adjust to the costs of production 
the increase in sales volume was due to a increase in the volume of wire rod and a increase in sales volume of rebar 
the higher wire rod volume was due to import duties imposed by the us government in the spring of on certain wire rod products 
the increase in rebar volumes is primarily due to increased demand as wholesale customers bought inventory ahead of the effective date of announced price increases 
as previously mentioned  the auto parts business was acquired on february  and was considered a step acquisition allowing the consolidation of its financial results as of the beginning of fiscal as such  revenues for fiscal included million related to the auto parts business with no comparable revenues being recognized for financial statement purposes in fiscal in order to aid the reader s understanding of the financial performance of this segment  the pro forma fiscal revenues for the auto parts business were million 
the million increase was primarily caused by an increase in wholesale revenues driven by higher average sales prices for scrapped autobodies due to rising ferrous recycled metal prices 
wholesale prices also benefited from the implementation of a new core distribution center that aggregated production volumes and provided an improved venue to sell these products to competing customers 
retail revenues were also up due to growth in part sales and admissions pricing 
cost of goods sold 
consolidated cost of goods sold increased million to million and was percent of revenues compared with in fiscal the decrease to was primarily due to improved margins  coming principally from higher selling prices  for all of the company s business segments 
cost of goods sold for the metals recycling business increased million to million before intercompany eliminations 
the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues decreased from for fiscal to during fiscal  contributing to a million increase in gross profit 
this increase in gross margin in fiscal was primarily attributable to higher selling prices and higher sales volume  partially offset by higher prices paid to suppliers of ferrous recycled metals and higher export freight rates  resulting in an per ton increase in the average ferrous metals cost of sales per ton 
cost of sales per ferrous ton increased as higher selling prices and higher demand for processed metal pushed up the purchase price the company paid for unprocessed metal 
competition from other recyclers for the purchase of unprocessed metal was also a factor in the cost increases 
the average export freight rate climbed per ton in fiscal compared with fiscal cost of goods sold for the steel manufacturing business increased million to million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease was due to a higher average sales price per ton and lowered fixed cost per ton  due to larger production volumes spreading the fixed costs over more tons produced  partially offset by higher prices paid for scrap metal 
melt shop production increased and rolling mill production increased compared with fiscal fiscal production volumes were temporarily curtailed in order to reduce inventory to better match it with customer demand 
average cost of sales per ton increased per ton compared with the prior fiscal year 
as this increase in cost of sales per ton was more than offset by the per ton increase in average net selling price  gross profit improved by million in fiscal compared with fiscal the auto parts business cost of sales was million lower during fiscal as compared to the pro forma cost of sales for fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased from to 
this improvement was due to higher margins realized on wholesale sales partially offset by higher labor costs 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k impairment and other nonrecurring charges 
in connection with the acquisition of the auto parts business  the company conducted an environmental due diligence investigation 
based upon new information obtained in this investigation  the joint venture accrued million in environmental liabilities in the second quarter of fiscal for remediation costs at the auto parts business s store locations 
no environmental proceedings are pending at any of these sites 
the company recorded impairment and other nonrecurring charges of million in fiscal the company recorded nonrecurring charges of million for the early termination of a fixed price alaska barge contract of affreightment that management determined was not cost effective 
the alaska barge contract charge included a million write off of a note receivable and a million payment to terminate the contract 
also  an impairment charge of million was recorded for the elimination of an unprofitable car crushing business and an impairment charge of million was recorded for the closure of an under performing yard in reno  nevada 
nonrecurring charges of million were recorded for the loss on the early termination of two vessel charter contracts with a related company 
the company terminated the leases in order to take advantage of market rates which were to per ton lower than the all in contracted rates 
shipping cost savings as a result of the contract termination totaled approximately million 
additionally  a loss of million was recorded for the sale of a non strategic steel forging business 
operating income from joint ventures 
the company s joint ventures revenues and results of operations were as follows in thousands year ended august  total revenues from external customers recognized by joint ventures in the metals recycling business processing   brokering   joint venture suppliers of metals   operating income from joint ventures recognized by the company joint ventures in the metals recycling business   joint venture suppliers of metals  the joint ventures in the metals recycling business predominantly sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals 
the increase in revenues recognized by these joint ventures is attributable to higher average net ferrous selling prices 
shipments of ferrous metal processed by the joint ventures were million tons for the year ended august  compared with million tons in the prior year 
the volume of ferrous metal brokered by the joint ventures increased to million tons in fiscal compared to million tons in the prior year 
the average net selling price of ferrous recycled metal increased during that period to per ton from per ton  predominantly due to strong demand from asia  especially china and korea 
these joint ventures also increased their sales margins by improving operational efficiencies 
in fiscal  the company s share of income from joint ventures in the metals recycling business increased to million due to higher average net selling prices  increased margins and more efficient operations 
the company s joint ventures with hugo neu corporation  which earned the majority of the income  instituted eva concurrently with the company in fiscal the use of eva coupled with management changes has continued to result in improved operational efficiencies and increased profitability 
operating income in fiscal was reduced by million representing the company s share of the jv lifo inventory adjustment compared with a reduction of million in fiscal schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k revenues of the joint venture suppliers of metals decreased by million from fiscal as compared to the fiscal most of this decrease was caused by the reclassification in fiscal of the pick n pull joint venture  which is now consolidated and included as a new business segment  the auto parts business 
excluding the change caused by this reclassification  revenues decreased million during fiscal compared to last year due to lower selling prices and lower demolition revenue 
the company s equity in income from these joint ventures  excluding the impact of pick n pull  decreased million primarily due to the slowdown in the us economy 
selling expenses 
these expenses increased million compared with fiscal primarily due to an increase in export commission expense caused from higher ferrous recycled metals export sales 
general and administrative expenses 
compared with fiscal  general and administrative expenses increased million 
the consolidation of the auto parts business represents million of this increase 
the remainder of this increase is primarily due to increased bonus accruals directly related to the improvement in the company s eva performance 
interest expense 
in fiscal  interest expense decreased million compared with fiscal due to lower average interest rates and borrowings 
the company s borrowings averaged million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the average interest rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal other income and expenses 
other income and expenses decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal the difference is principally due to the addition of the auto parts business and a harbor maintenance tax refund received in fiscal in addition  this line item includes market value adjustments for changes in investment performance for securities held in a trust for the purpose of funding future non qualified pension payments 
the company recognized gains from the trust fund assets in the amount of million in fiscal and losses of million in fiscal income tax provision 
the company s effective rate of for fiscal was lower than the federal statutory tax rate for three primary reasons the implementation of sfas eliminated the amortization of goodwill  some of which had been nondeductible  export sales  which under federal law are taxed at a lower rate than domestic sales increased  and net operating loss carryforwards that accompanied an earlier acquisition continued to provide benefit 
the fiscal tax rate of benefited from the two latter items  as well as from the one time recognition of california tax credits that had been generated over the previous ten years 
as part of the acquisition of proler international corp 
proler  the company acquired million of federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
the company recognized no immediate tax benefit for the nols 
instead  the company set up an offsetting million valuation allowance because the ultimate use of the nols was uncertain given the then current federal tax law proscription against applying the nols to any taxable income other than the post acquisition income generated by proler 
a change to federal tax law in  however  allowed an annual million of nol to be applied to taxable income from all sources  not just from proler 
due to this change in tax law  the company released an annual million from the valuation allowance  and recognized the corresponding million in tax benefit  in fiscal years and this is a major reason why the company s effective tax rates were lower than the statutory rates for those years 
the company also acquired million of credits as part of the proler acquisition 
as with the nols  a valuation allowance was set up to offset the credits 
no part of the valuation allowance had been released as of august  the credits are not likely to be used until after the nols have been used or expire 
the credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
in fiscal  the company qualified for million of enterprise zone tax credits in the state of california 
these credits can be used to offset california state income taxes to the extent that the company has a california franchise income tax liability on taxable income apportionable to each zone 
any credits in excess of the tax liability can be carried forward indefinitely 
these credits  combined with the release of million of valuation allowance pertaining schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k to the nols  were major reasons why the company s effective tax rate of for fiscal was well below the statutory rate of 
liquidity and capital resources 
for fiscal  cash generated from operations was million  compared to million in fiscal the increase in cash flow from operations was primary related to an improvement in net income  offset by the reinvestment of cash flow by the hugo neu joint ventures and an increase in inventories  which is a result of higher inventory quantities on hand at august  and increased inventory costs for raw materials at all divisions 
capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the capital expenditures in fiscal included production improvement projects  including partial payments on the new state of the art mega shredder at the company s oakland  california recycling facility and the major furnace replacement at our steel manufacturing business 
in march  the company completed the acquisition of three self service used auto parts stores in canada for a purchase price of million 
during fiscal  the company also made additional post closing payments of million related to the acquisition of pick and pull auto dismantling  inc  which closed in february as a result of acquisitions completed in prior years  the company had million of environment liabilities as of august  over the next months  the company expects to pay approximately million relating to a previously accrued remediation projects in connection with one of its metals recycling facilities located in the state of washington on the hylebos waterway 
additionally  the company expects to require significant future cash outlays as it incurs the actual costs relating to the remediation of other such environmental liabilities 
as of august   the company had a committed unsecured bank credit facility totaling million that matures in may the credit facility contains a provision whereby the company may  upon obtaining consent of the bank group  extend the term of the agreement by one year to may the company has provided notice of its intention to request such an extension and the bank group has agreed to the request 
the extension is subject to the company providing standard representations and warranties as of the may original maturity date 
the company currently anticipates it will be able to provide the required representations and warranties and the agreement will be extended 
the company also has additional unsecured credit lines totaling million  which are uncommitted 
the company s debt agreements have certain restrictive covenants 
as of august   the company had aggregate bank borrowings outstanding under these facilities of million and was in compliance with such covenants 
in july  the company s metals recycling joint ventures with hugo neu corporation entered into a revolving credit facility jv credit facility with a group of banks for working capital and general corporate purposes 
prior to that time  the joint ventures working capital and other cash needs had been met by advances provided equally by the company and its partner  hugo neu corporation 
during february  the facility was increased to million 
the jv credit facility expires on january  and is secured by the inventory and receivables of the joint venture businesses 
the company is not a guarantor of the jv credit facility 
the jv credit facility has a number of covenants and restrictions  including restrictions on the level of distributions to the joint venture partners 
as of august   there was no debt outstanding under the credit facility and the joint ventures were in compliance with these covenants 
it is the company s present intention to not renew the facility upon its expiration  in which case the company and its partner will need to revert to funding the cash needs of the joint ventures on an equal basis 
the joint venture agreements allow for distributions to the joint venture partners 
during the two year period ended august   the company recorded million in operating income representing its share in the earnings of the joint ventures 
however  during this time the company received no cash distributions 
instead  the hugo neu joint ventures have been utilizing all of their available cash flow to fund expansion of working capital  business growth  and investment in state of the art equipment to improve the efficiencies and capabilities of their business and to pay down borrowings from the jv credit facility

factors that could affect future results 
this form k  including item of part l and item of part ii  contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of one can generally identify these forward looking statements because they contain expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  plans and other words which convey a similar meaning 
one can also identify these statements as they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
examples of factors affecting schnitzer steel industries  inc s wholly owned operations and its joint ventures the company that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following cyclicality and general market considerations purchase and selling prices for recycled metals are highly cyclical in nature and subject to worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  the cost and availability of recycled metals are subject to global supply and demand conditions which are volatile and beyond the company s control  resulting in periodic fluctuations in recycled metals prices and working capital requirements 
while the company attempts to maintain and grow margins by responding to changing recycled metals selling prices through adjustments to its metals purchase prices  the company s ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors 
additionally  changing prices could potentially impact the volume of recycled metal available to the company  the subsequent volume of processed metal sold by the company  inventory levels and the timing of collections and levels relating to the company s accounts receivable balances 
moreover  increases in recycled metals selling prices can adversely affect the operating results of the company s steel manufacturing business because increases in steel prices generally lag increases in ferrous recycled metals prices 
the steel industry is also highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions 
future economic downturns or a stagnant economy may adversely affect the performance of the company 
the company expects to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and net income 
revenues can fluctuate significantly quarter to quarter due to factors such as the seasonal slowdown in the construction industry  which is an important buyer of the company s finished steel products 
the timing and extent of the slowdown is also dependent on the weather 
another factor which may affect revenues relates to the seasonal reduction in demand from foreign customers who tend to reduce their finished steel production and corresponding scrap metal requirements  during the summer months to offset higher energy costs 
also  severe weather conditions may affect the company s global market conditions 
the company makes a number of large ferrous recycled metals shipments to foreign steel producers each year 
customer requirements  shipping schedules and other factors limit the company s control over the timing of these shipments 
variations in the number of foreign shipments from quarter to quarter will result in fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 
the company s expectations regarding ferrous metal sales prices and volumes  as well as earnings  are based in part on a number of assumptions which are difficult to predict for example  uncertainties relating to customer orders  metal availability  estimated freight rates  ship availability  cost and volume of unprocessed inventory and production output  etc the auto parts business experiences modest seasonal fluctuations in demand 
the retail stores are open to the elements 
during periods of extreme temperatures and precipitation  customers tend to delay their purchases and wait for milder conditions 
as a result  retail sales are generally higher during the spring and fall of each calendar year and lower in the winter and summer months 
additionally  the auto parts business is subject to a number of other risks that could prevent it from maintaining or exceeding its current levels of profitability  such as volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for its products  services and raw materials  environmental issues  local and worldwide schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k economic conditions  increased competition  the ultimate success of the company s growth and acquisition plans  and business integration and management transition issues 
competition the recycled metals industry is highly competitive  with the volume of purchases and sales subject to a number of competitive factors  principally price 
the company competes with both large and numerous smaller companies in its markets for the purchase of recyclable metals 
the company also competes with a number of domestic and foreign recycled metals processors and brokers for processed and unprocessed metal as well as for sales to domestic and foreign customers 
for example  in and  lower cost ferrous recycled metals supplies from certain foreign countries adversely affected market selling prices for ferrous recycled metals 
since then  many of these countries have imposed export restrictions which have significantly reduced their export volumes and lowered the worldwide supply of ferrous recycled metals 
these restrictions are believed to have had a positive effect on the company s selling prices 
given the intricacies in which the global markets operate  the company cannot predict when or if foreign countries will change their trading policies and what effect  if any  such changes might have on the company s operating results 
from time to time  both the united states and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which the company operates 
in fiscal  the company completed filing requirements with china to continue to allow the shipment of recycled metals into china 
the documents are part of a certification process to ensure safe industrial and agricultural production in china 
also  it is not unusual for various constituencies to petition government entities to impose new restrictions or change current laws 
if imposed  these restrictions could affect the company s margins as well as its ability to ship goods to foreign customers 
alternatively  restrictions could also affect the global availability of ferrous recycled metals  thereby affecting the company s volumes and margins 
as a result  it is difficult to predict what  if any  impact pending or future trade restrictions will have on the operations of the company 
for the metals recycling business  some of the more significant domestic competitors include regional steel mills and their brokers who compete for recycled metal for the purpose of providing the mill with feedstock to produce finished steel 
during periods when market supplies of metal are in short supply  these buyers may  at times  react by raising buying prices to levels that are not reasonable in relation to more normal market conditions 
as a result  the company may have to raise its buying prices to maintain its production levels which may result in compressed margins 
the auto parts business competes with both full service and self service auto dismantlers as well as larger well financed retail auto parts chains for retail customers 
periodically  the auto parts business increases prices  which may affect customer flow and buying patterns 
additionally  in markets where the company has only a few stores  it does not have the same pricing power it experiences in markets where it has more than one store in which it operates 
as this segment expands  the company may experience new competition from others attempting to replicate the company s business model 
the ultimate impact of these dynamics cannot be predicted 
also  the business competes for its automobile inventory with other dismantlers  used car dealers  auto auctions and metal recyclers 
inventory costs can fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions and prices for recycled metal 
the domestic steel industry also is highly competitive 
steel prices can be highly volatile and price is a significant competitive factor 
the company competes domestically with several steel producers in the western united states for sales of its products 
in recent years  the company has experienced significant foreign competition  which is sometimes subsidized by large government agencies 
there can be no assurance that such competition will not increase in the future 
in the spring of  the us government imposed anti dumping and countervailing duties against wire rod products from eight foreign countries 
these duties have assisted the company in increasing sales of wire rod products  any expiration or termination of the duties could have a corresponding adverse effect 
in december  nucor corporation nucor assumed ownership of the assets of birmingham steel corp  and acquired a steel manufacturing business in seattle  washington 
nucor corporation  the leader in setting finished steel prices in the company s finished steel markets  has a significant share of the west coast steel market and is considered an aggressive competitor 
nucor has consolidated much of the west coast domestic steel production with the purchase of the former birmingham steel mill in seattle  washington and the former north star mill in kingman  schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k arizona 
the kingman mill has been idle since  any future start up of its operations could negatively impact the company s recycled metal and finished steel markets  prices  margins and  potentially  cash flow 
geographical concentration the company competes in the scrap metal business through its wholly owned metals recycling business as well as through its joint venture businesses 
over the last few years  a significant portion of the revenues and operating profits earned in these segments have been generated from sales to asian countries  principally china and south korea 
in addition  the company s sales in these countries are also concentrated with relatively few customers that vary depending on buying cycles and general market conditions 
due to the concentration of sales in these countries and to a relatively small customer base  a significant change in buying patterns  change in political events  change in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other export restrictions within the united states or these foreign countries  severe weather conditions or general changes in economic conditions could adversely affect the financial results of the company 
union contracts the company has a number of union contracts that expire in fiscal year labor contract negotiations have not commenced with any of these unions 
if the company is unable to reach agreement on the terms of a new contract with any of these unions  the company could be subject to work slowdowns or work stoppages 
post retirement benefits the company has a number of post retirement benefit plans that include defined benefit and multiemployer plans 
the company s contributions to the defined benefit plans are determined by actuarial calculations which are based on a number of estimates including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  allocation of plan assets between equity or fixed income investments  expected rate of compensation increases as well as other factors 
changes in these actual rates from year to year cause increases or decreases in the company s annual contributions into the defined benefit plans and changes to the expenses recognized in a current fiscal year 
management and the actuary evaluate these rates annually and adjust if necessary 
the company s union employees participate in a number of multiemployer pension plans 
the company is not the sponsor or administrator of these multiemployer plans 
contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of the negotiated labor contracts 
the company is unable to determine its relative portion or estimate its future liability under the multiemployer pension plans 
the company learned during the fourth quarter of that one of the multiemployer plans would not meet erisa minimum funding standards for the plan year ending september  the trustees of that plan have applied to the internal revenue service for certain relief from this minimum funding standard  but cannot determine whether this relief will be granted 
absent relief  the plan s contributing employers will be required to make additional contributions or pay excise tax that may equal or exceed the full amount of that deficiency 
the company estimates its share of the required additional contribution for the plan year is approximately million and has accrued for such amount in fiscal joint ventures the company has significant investments in joint venture companies  the most substantial of which are its five metals recycling joint ventures with hugo neu corporation hnc 
in each case  the day to day activities of the joint venture business are managed by the company s joint venture partner  not the company 
as a result  the company does not have the same ability to control or predict the operations  cash flow  expenditures  debt  and related financial results as it does with its consolidated businesses 
therefore  it is difficult to predict the financial results of the joint ventures 
in recent years  the company s relationship with the chief executive officer of hnc  its most significant joint venture partner  has deteriorated 
there have been disagreements regarding business decisions as well as personality clashes  but the company does not believe that these issues have materially affected the operations or operating results of the joint ventures  which have shown dramatic financial improvement since fiscal the company is currently disputing hnc s recent unilateral assertion of a right to be paid certain commissions on sales by the joint venture engaged in global brokering of recycled metals  as described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item as described in liquidity and capital resources above  the company s present intention is to not renew the million jv credit facility when it matures in january  and for the company and hnc to revert to funding the cash needs of the joint ventures on an equal basis 
if hnc does not fund its share of joint venture cash needs  the operations of the global brokering joint venture  which has relied extensively on the jv credit facility for working capital support  could be adversely affected 
the company believes it desirable for the company and hnc to end the current joint venture relationships  however  the joint venture agreements do not provide for a mechanism to break up the ventures 
preliminary discussions regarding possible transactions to terminate the relationship occur from time to time  but these discussions have not resulted in any agreement regarding the structure  valuation or terms of such a transaction 
as such discussions periodically continue  the company will evaluate its disclosure obligations  but does not presently intend to make any further disclosure regarding the existence or status of such discussions unless and until an agreement is reached  if ever

the joint venture businesses are affected by many of the same risk factors mentioned in this document 
additionally  two of these joint ventures continue to use lifo inventory accounting  which tends to defer income taxes 
historically  the effects of lifo adjustments  which are recorded during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  have been difficult to predict 
energy supply the company and its joint ventures utilize various energy sources to operate their facilities 
in particular  electricity and natural gas currently represent approximately of the cost of steel manufactured for the company s steel manufacturing business 
the steel manufacturing business purchases electric power under a long term contract from mcminnville water light mcminnville which in turn relies on the bonneville power administration bpa 
historically  these contracts have had favorable prices and are long term in nature 
the company has a five year contract that expires in september on october   the bpa increased its electricity rates due to increased demand on the west coast and lower supplies 
this increase was in the form of a cost recovery adjustment clause crac added to bpa s contract with mcminnville 
the crac is an additional monthly surcharge on selected power charges to recover costs associated with buying higher priced power during the west coast power shortage 
because bpa can adjust the crac every six months  it is not possible to predict future rate changes 
the steel manufacturing business also has a contract for natural gas at mmbtu 
the current contract expires on may  and obligates the business to purchase minimum amounts of gas at a fixed rate 
effective november   the natural gas rate will be reduced to per mmbtu 
this is a take or pay contract with a minimum average usage of  mmbtu per day 
gas not used is sold on the open market and gains or losses are recorded in cost of sales 
if the company is unable to negotiate favorable terms of electricity  natural gas and other energy sources  this could adversely affect the performance of the company 
tax laws the company has been able to reduce its effective tax rate below the federal statutory tax rate for each of the last three years by using a combination of net operating loss carryforwards nols  tax credits in state of california enterprise zones  and federal extraterritorial income exclusion eti tax benefits associated with making foreign sales 
in response to recent determinations by the world trade organization that the eti tax benefit constituted an illegal export subsidy  congress passed the american jobs creation act of the act  which became law on october  a key provision of the act eliminates the eti deduction over the next two years  offsetting it in part with a deduction for qualified production activities income 
until regulations are issued explaining the new deduction  any projection of its effect on the company s worldwide tax rate would necessarily be imprecise  but the current projection is that the tax rate would approximate in fiscal the company s worldwide tax rate is also apt to be higher in fiscal for two reasons unrelated to the act all net operation losses nols have been used for gaap purposes  and further discovery of significant state tax credits is unlikely 
as noted above  both items have served to reduce the effective tax rate in recent years 
currency fluctuations demand from the company s foreign customers is partially driven by foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
recent weakness of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies has been a significant factor in the increases in recycled metals prices over the last year  as well as resulted in increasing the cost of certain finished steel imports 
strengthening of the us dollar could adversely affect the competitiveness of the company s products in the markets in which the company competes 
the company has no control over such fluctuations and  as such  these dynamics could affect the company s revenues and earnings 
schnitzer steel industries  inc 
form k shipping and handling both the metals recycling business and the steel manufacturing business often rely on third parties to handle and transport their products to end users in a timely manner 
the cost to transport the products  in particular by ocean freight  can be affected by circumstances over which the company has no control such as fuel prices  political events  governmental regulations on transportation and changes in market rates due to carrier availability 
in estimating future operating results  the company makes certain assumptions regarding shipping costs 
given the recent tightness in the ocean freight market  the company has experienced significant increases in its shipping costs which have adversely affected operating income 
since it is difficult to predict the future costs for shipping the company s products  actual results could differ materially from forecasts 
insurance the cost of the company s insurance is affected not only by its own loss experience but also by cycles in the insurance market 
the company cannot predict future events and circumstances which could cause rates to materially change such as war  terrorist activities or natural disasters 
asset acquisition and disposition throughout the company s history  it has made a number of acquisitions and divestures as management attempts to improve the value of the company for its shareholders 
over the last few years this activity has principally been limited to acquisitions related to the auto parts business 
it is anticipated that the company will continue to pursue additional expansion of the auto parts business as well as other business segments 
each acquisition or disposition comes with its own inherent risks that make it difficult to predict the ultimate success of the transaction 
an acquisition or disposition may have a negative and or unexpected impact on the company s cash flow  operating income  net income  earnings per share and financial position 
intercompany sales the auto parts business sells autobodies to the metals recycling business  and the metals recycling business sells ferrous recycled metal to the steel manufacturing business  at prices that are intended to approximate market 
when the company consolidates its results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company eliminates the intercompany sales and purchases and also eliminates the estimated profit remaining in inventory profit elimination at the end of each reporting period 
in estimating future operating and financial performance  the company makes assumptions regarding the forecasted profit elimination computation and its impact on the quarterly financial results of the company 
small variations in price  sales volume  production volume  and purchase prices and volumes from both within the company and from third parties can result in significant differences between forecasted profit elimination and actual results 
it is not possible to predict or identify all factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements 
consequently  the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties 
further  the company does not assume any obligation to update any forward looking statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to limit exposure to changes in interest rates 
because such derivative instruments are used solely as hedges and not for speculative trading purposes  they do not represent incremental risk to the company 
for further discussion of derivative financial instruments  refer to fair value of financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements included in item  note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements
