critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company makes estimates and assumptions in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  the company is often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of its accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
for example  judgment is required in determining whether a customer arrangement has multiple elements 
if such a situation exists  judgment is also involved in determining whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
while the company follows specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  significant management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas described above as well as collectibility 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
this allowance is established using estimates that the company makes based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if the company used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
deferred income taxes the company had a net deferred tax asset of million at november  the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if the company were to change its assumptions or otherwise determine that it was unable to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made

software license revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal software license revenue would have increased by in fiscal if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal the increase in software license revenue in fiscal was due to an increase in revenue from sales to direct end users and  to a lesser extent  application partners aps  companies that have written software applications utilizing psc technology and that resell the company s products in conjunction with the sale of their applications 
software license revenue from the progress product set increased year over year  primarily within the database product and other deployment and management products 
software license revenue also increased from new products  such as the sonic product line  as well as from objectstore 
maintenance and services revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal maintenance and services revenue would have increased by in fiscal if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal the increase in maintenance and services revenue was the result of growth in the company s installed customer base and renewal of maintenance contracts  partially offset by a decline in services revenue 
the decline in services revenue was primarily the result of decreases in consulting revenue in emea and the latin america region due to fewer projects as a result of economic conditions and a slower overall market for professional services 
education revenue also decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal 
table of contents total revenue generated in markets outside north america increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and represented of total revenue in fiscal as compared to of total revenue in fiscal the increase was the result of higher revenue from emea and asia pacific  partially offset by a continued decline in revenue from latin america in fiscal the decrease in this region was due to an overall market slowdown in the purchase of packaged applications  especially in the government sector in various countries within latin america 
total revenue generated in markets outside north america as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal would have been if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal the company is planning for total revenue growth in fiscal in the mid to high single digits from existing businesses and expects total reported revenue to show an increase of around with the addition of datadirect 
this revenue expectation is based on a number of assumptions  including the continued success of the company s aps  improvement in the company s ability to generate new business in end user accounts  the company s ability to successfully integrate the products and personnel from datadirect  continued high growth from the company s new product sets  especially the sonic product line  and no significant strengthening of the us dollar against currencies from which the company derives a significant portion of its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in achieving its forecasts and plans or that other factors will not negatively impact its revenue 
cost of software licenses consists primarily of cost of product media  documentation  duplication  packaging  royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs 
cost of software licenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of software license revenue from to 
the dollar and percentage decreases were primarily due to lower royalty expense for products and technologies licensed from third parties and lower amortization expense from previously capitalized software costs

cost of maintenance and services decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of maintenance and services revenue from to 
the maintenance and services revenue margin improvement was due to a change in the mix of maintenance and services revenue 
maintenance revenue  which has a substantially higher margin than professional services revenue  represented a greater proportion of the total maintenance and services revenue in fiscal the dollar decrease was due to lower usage of third party contractors for service engagements  partially offset by increased headcount related expenses primarily in technical support assumed in the acquisition of excelon 
the company increased its technical support  education and consulting staff by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to

 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the amount capitalized in fiscal represented of total product development costs that year 
capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated life of the product generally four years in an amount equal to the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current revenue to total expected revenue in the product s life or the amount computed using the straight line method 
amounts amortized are included in cost of software licenses 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the finance  human resources  legal  information systems and administrative departments of the company 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but remained the same percentage of total revenue at 
general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount related costs  the impact of changes in exchange rates and an increase in amortization expense from acquired intangible assets 
the expense increase in fiscal also was due to transition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of excelon 
the company increased its administrative staff by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal acquired in process research and development of million was expensed when the acquisition of excelon was consummated because the technological feasibility of several products under development at the time of the acquisition had not been achieved and no alternate future uses had been established 
research and development costs to bring the acquired products to technological feasibility are not expected to have a material impact on the company s future results of operations or cash flows 
income from operations increased as a percentage of total revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the dollar increase and the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue were primarily due to higher revenue during the year  partially offset by continued investment in new business opportunities such as sonic software and peerdirect 
in addition  the company s total headcount increased throughout fiscal  primarily due to the personnel acquired from excelon 
if the company is able to meet its forecasted revenue target and expenses occur as planned  the company expects operating income as a percentage of revenue to be between and in fiscal  excluding the impact of any one time  acquisition related charges related to datadirect 
other income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding a noncash impairment charge of million related to the company s investment in a related party  easyask  inc  in fiscal  the company s other income would have decreased primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash balances  partially offset by lower foreign exchange transaction losses

factors that may affect future results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves certain risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
fluctuations in revenue and quarterly results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors 
some of these factors include changes in demand for the company s products  introduction  enhancement or announcement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  the growth rates of certain market segments including enterprise application integration and messaging  size and timing of significant orders  budgeting cycles of customers  mix of distribution channels  mix of products and services sold  mix of international and north american revenues  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in the level of operating expenses  changes in the company s sales incentive plans  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products announced by the company or its competitors and general economic conditions in regions in which the company conducts business 
revenue forecasting is uncertain  in large part  because the company generally ships its products shortly after receipt of orders 
most of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  including costs of personnel and facilities  and are not easily reduced 
thus  an unexpected reduction in the company s revenue  or failure to achieve the anticipated rate of growth  would have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the company 
global economic and political conditions the global economic and political environment and the current business climate are likely to impact the company s revenue and net income in the near term 
political instability and armed conflict in various regions of the world also contribute to economic uncertainty 
if customers buying patterns  such as decision making processes  timing of expected deliveries and timing of new projects  unfavorably change due to economic or political conditions  there will be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents products ongoing enhancements to the company s various product sets will be required to enable the company to maintain its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to its products on a timely basis  or that the enhancements will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
failure to develop enhancements that meet market needs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
overlaying the risks associated with the company s existing products and enhancements are ongoing technological developments and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that take advantage of technological advances and respond to new customer requirements 
the development of new products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products incorporating new technology on a timely basis  or that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
the company has derived most of its revenue from its core product line  openedge  and other products that complement openedge and are generally licensed only in conjunction with openedge 
accordingly  the company s future results depend on continued market acceptance of openedge and any factor adversely affecting the market for openedge could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
some of the company s newer products  such as the sonic and peerdirect product sets  require a higher level of development  distribution and support expenditures  on a percentage of revenue basis than the openedge or datadirect product lines 
if revenue generated from these products becomes a greater percentage of the company s total revenue and if the expenses associated with these products on a percentage of revenue basis do not decrease  then the company s operating margins will be adversely affected 
future acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions of businesses or investments in companies that offer complementary products  services and technologies  such as the recently completed acquisition of datadirect 
such acquisitions or investments involve a number of risks  including the risks of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  realizing the value of the acquired assets relative to the price paid  distraction of management from the company s ongoing businesses and potential product disruptions associated with the sale of the acquired company s products 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could include stock 
as a result  future acquisitions could cause dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share 
distribution channels and new markets future results also depend upon the company s continued successful distribution of its products through its ap and oem channels and may be impacted by downward pressure on pricing  which may not be offset by increases in volume 
aps utilize technology from the company to create their applications and resell the company s products along with their own applications 
oems embed the company s products within their software product or technology device 
any adverse effect on the aps or oems businesses related to competition  pricing and other factors could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
sonic software is currently developing and enhancing the sonic product set and other new products and services 
the market for enterprise application integration  web services  messaging products and other internet business to business products is highly competitive 
many potential customers have made significant investments in proprietary or internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to the sonic product set or other third party products 
global e commerce and online exchange of information on the internet and other similar open wide area networks continue to evolve 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be successful in penetrating these evolving markets 

table of contents competition the company experiences significant competition from a variety of sources with respect to the marketing and distribution of its products 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing or technical resources than the company and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than can the company 
increased competition could make it more difficult for the company to maintain its market presence 
the marketplace for new products is intensely competitive and characterized by low barriers to entry 
as a result  new competitors possessing technological  marketing or other competitive advantages may emerge and rapidly acquire market share 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to deliver products that better address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
current and potential competitors also may be more successful than the company in having their products or technologies widely accepted 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and its failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
international operations the company typically generates approximately of its total revenue from sales outside of north america 
because a majority of the company s total revenue is derived from international operations that are primarily conducted in foreign currencies  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
in the past year  the us dollar has been significantly weaker than in the previous few years against most major foreign currencies  which has positively affected the company s revenue and results of operations 
this trend may not continue 
there can be no assurance that the company s currency hedging transactions will materially reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on such results 
if for any reason exchange or price controls or other restrictions on the conversion of foreign currencies were imposed  the company s business could be adversely affected 
other potential risks inherent in the company s international business generally include longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  economic instability in emerging markets and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one of these factors could adversely impact the success of the company s international operations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations  and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
taxation of extraterritorial income the company currently receives significant benefits from the extraterritorial income eti exclusion provisions of the current us tax law 
the world trade organization wto has ruled that these provisions constitute a prohibited export subsidy and that the european union may impose trade sanctions if us rules are not brought into compliance 
president bush has stated the us will bring its tax laws into compliance with the wto ruling  but the administration and congress have not decided on a solution for this issue 
it is not possible to predict what impact the wto decision will have on the company s future results pending final resolution of these matters 
if the eti exclusion is repealed and replacement legislation providing similar benefit is not enacted  the loss of this tax benefit  which currently provides approximately a five to six absolute percentage point reduction in the company s effective tax rate  would have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the company 
hiring and retention of skilled employees the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
there is significant competition for such personnel in the software industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably 

table of contents intellectual property and proprietary rights the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies principally on a combination of contract provisions and copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future or that any such claims will not be successful 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  whether or not the company ultimately prevails on the merits  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
such litigation could also result in the company being prohibited from selling one or more of its products or cause reluctance by potential customers to purchase the company s products 
third party technology the company also utilizes certain technology which it licenses from third parties  including software which is integrated with internally developed software and used in the company s products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that functionally similar technology will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future  or at all 
stock price volatility the market price of the company s common stock  like that of other technology companies  is highly volatile and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or other events or factors 
the company s stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company has established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and has policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company limits default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
the company s investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  the company has classified all its debt securities as available for sale 
this classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk if such investments are held until their maturity date 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments  and cash flows are immaterial 
the company has entered into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to hedge certain transactions of selected foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company has not entered into foreign exchange option and forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these contracts are based on the designation of the contracts as hedging instruments 
the criteria the company uses for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and matching of derivative instruments to the underlying transactions 
market value increases and decreases on the foreign exchange option and forward contracts are generally recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
the company operates in certain countries where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus the company has unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
the company generally does not hedge the net assets of its international subsidiaries 
the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange option contracts at november  was million 

table of contents unrealized market value gains on such contracts were immaterial at november  based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates  the company s revenue would be adversely affected by approximately and the company s net income would be adversely affected by approximately excluding any offsetting positive impact from the company s ongoing hedging programs  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
