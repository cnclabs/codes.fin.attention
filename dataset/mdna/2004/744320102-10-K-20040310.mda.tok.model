item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the forward looking statements included on the table of contents  selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the consolidated financial statements of prudential insurance for periods prior to the demutualization in december became the historical consolidated financial statements of prudential financial 
overview demutualization and related transactions on the date of demutualization  prudential insurance converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial 
on that date  eligible policyholders  as defined in the plan of reorganization  received shares of prudential financial s common stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits  which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits  upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in prudential insurance 
also on the date of demutualization  prudential financial completed an initial public offering of its common stock and completed the sale  through a private placement  of its class b stock  a separate class of common stock 
the common stock reflects the performance of the financial services businesses and the class b stock reflects the performance of the closed block business  which are discussed below 
financial services businesses and closed block business financial services businesses we refer to the businesses in our three operating divisions and our corporate and other operations  collectively  as our financial services businesses 
the insurance division consists of our individual life and annuities and group insurance segments 
the investment division consists of our investment management  financial advisory  retirement  and other asset management segments 
the international insurance and investments division consists of our international insurance and international investments segments 
we also have corporate and other operations  which includes our real estate and relocation services business  as well as corporate items and initiatives that are not allocated to business segments 
corporate and other operations also include businesses that have been or will be divested and businesses that we have placed in wind down status 
we attribute financing costs to each segment based on the amount of financing used by each segment 
the net investment income of each segment includes earnings on the amount of equity that management believes is necessary to support the risks of that segment 
we seek growth internally and through acquisition  joint ventures or other forms of business combination or investment 
our principal acquisition focus is in our current business lines  both domestic and international 
closed block business in connection with the demutualization  we ceased offering domestic participating products 
the liabilities for our individual in force participating products were segregated  together with assets  in a regulatory mechanism referred to as the closed block  as required by the plan of reorganization 
the closed block is designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations for future policy dividends after demutualization of holders of policies included in the 
table of contents closed block by allocating assets that will be used exclusively for payment of benefits  including policyholder dividends  expenses and taxes with respect to these products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the closed block 
we selected the amount and type of closed block assets and closed block liabilities included in the closed block so that the closed block assets initially had a lower book value than the closed block liabilities 
we expect that the closed block assets will generate sufficient cash flow  together with anticipated revenues from the closed block policies  over the life of the closed block to fund payments of all expenses  taxes  and policyholder benefits to be paid to  and the reasonable dividend expectations of  policyholders of the closed block policies 
we also segregated for accounting purposes the assets that we need to hold outside the closed block to meet capital requirements related to the policies included within the closed block 
no policies sold after demutualization will be added to the closed block  and its in force business is expected to ultimately decline as we pay policyholder benefits in full 
we also expect the proportion of our business represented by the closed block to decline as we grow other businesses 
also concurrently with our demutualization  prudential holdings  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential financial that owns the capital stock of prudential insurance  issued billion in senior secured notes the ihc debt 
the net proceeds from the issuances of the class b stock and ihc debt  except for million used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a portion of the bond insurance cost associated with that debt  were allocated to the financial services businesses 
however  we expect that the ihc debt will be serviced by the net cash flows of the closed block business over time  and we include interest expenses associated with the ihc debt when we report results of the closed block business 
the closed block business consists principally of the closed block  assets held outside the closed block that prudential insurance needs to hold to meet capital requirements related to the closed block policies  invested assets held outside the closed block that represent the difference between the closed block assets and closed block liabilities and the interest maintenance reserve  deferred policy acquisition costs related to closed block policies  the principal amount of the ihc debt and related hedging activities and certain other related assets and liabilities 
for periods prior to demutualization  the results of the closed block business are those of our former traditional participating products segment 
upon the establishment of the closed block business  we transferred billion of net assets previously associated with the former traditional participating products segment  which were in excess of the amounts necessary to support the closed block business  to the financial services businesses 
consequently  income from continuing operations before income taxes of the closed block business includes returns on these net assets for periods prior to the demutualization 
revenues and expenses we earn our revenues principally from insurance premiums  mortality  expense  and asset management fees from insurance and investment products  and investment of general account and other funds 
we earn premiums primarily from the sale of individual life insurance and group life and disability insurance 
we earn mortality  expense  and asset management fees from the sale and servicing of separate account products including variable life insurance and variable annuities 
we also earn asset management and administrative fees from the distribution  servicing and management of mutual funds  retirement products and other asset management products and services 
our operating expenses principally consist of insurance benefits provided  general business expenses  dividends to policyholders  commissions and other costs of selling and servicing the various products we sell and interest credited on general account liabilities 
profitability our profitability depends principally on our ability to price and manage risk on insurance products  our ability to attract and retain customer assets and our ability to manage expenses 
specific drivers of our profitability include our ability to manufacture and distribute products and services and to introduce new products that gain market acceptance on a timely basis  our ability to price our insurance products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the cost of providing benefits and the expense of acquiring customers and administering those products  our mortality and morbidity experience on individual and group life insurance  annuity and group disability insurance products  our persistency experience  which affects our ability to recover the cost of acquiring new business over the lives of the contracts  
table of contents our cost of administering insurance contracts and providing asset management products and services  our returns on invested assets  net of the amounts we credit to policyholders accounts  our ability to earn commissions and fees from the distribution and servicing of mutual funds  annuities  defined contribution and other investment products at a level that enables us to earn a margin over the expense of providing such services  the performance of our investment in wachovia securities  the amount of our assets under management and changes in their fair value  which affect the amount of asset management fees we receive  and our ability to generate favorable investment results through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocation 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition  interest rates  taxes  foreign exchange rates  securities market conditions and general economic conditions affect our profitability 
in some of our product lines  particularly those in the closed block business  we share experience on mortality  morbidity  persistency and investment results with our customers  which can offset the impact of these factors on our profitability from those products 
historically  the participating products included in the closed block have yielded lower returns on capital invested than many of our other businesses 
as we have ceased offering domestic participating products  we expect that the proportion of the traditional participating products in our in force business will gradually diminish as these older policies age  and we grow other businesses 
however  the relatively lower returns to us on this existing block of business will continue to affect our consolidated results of operations for many years 
our common stock reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  but there can be no assurance that the market value of the common stock will reflect solely the performance of these businesses 
executive summary prudential financial is one of the largest financial services firms in the us  offering clients a wide array of financial products and services  including individual life insurance  annuities  group life and disability insurance and pension and retirement services 
we also offer mutual funds  asset management  real estate and relocation services and  through our investment in wachovia securities  securities brokerage services 
we serve individual and institutional customers in over countries through a variety of channels  including one of the largest proprietary distribution forces in the life insurance industry 
the significant developments and events in reflected our efforts to effectively redeploy capital to seek enhanced returns 
these developments included the acquisition of american skandia  completed may   for a total purchase price of billion  the results of which are included in our individual life and annuities segment 
the combination of our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of wachovia  forming a joint venture  wachovia securities  in which we retained a ownership interest 
the sale of our property and casualty insurance business 
the repurchase of million shares of common stock during the year  at a total cost of billion 
a increase in our common stock dividend  to cents per share 
it is our intention to continue strategies to redeploy capital to enhance returns in  with specific focus on the following completion of the previously announced acquisition of cigna s retirement business  expected to close in the first half of integration of hyundai investment and securities co  ltd  a korean asset management firm of which we acquired in early continuation of our share repurchase program 
in early  prudential financial s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to purchase up to billion of outstanding common stock in 
table of contents our common stock nyse pru reflects the performance of our financial services businesses  which consist of our insurance  investment  and international insurance and investments divisions as well as our corporate and other operations 
our class b stock  which is not traded on any exchange  reflects the performance of our closed block business  which includes our in force participating life insurance and annuity policies and assets that are being used for the payment of benefits and policyholder dividends on these policies  as well as other assets and equity that support these policies 
we analyze performance of the segments of the financial services business using a non gaap measure called adjusted operating income 
see consolidated results of operations for a definition of adjusted operating income and a discussion of its use as a measure of operating performance 
shown below are the segments providing the largest contribution to our adjusted operating income in  their comparable contributions in prior years  the adjusted operating income of our remaining segments and a reconciliation of adjusted operating income of our segments to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes

accounting policies pronouncements application of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment 
management  on an ongoing basis  reviews estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements 
if management determines that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate given current facts and circumstances  results of operations and financial position as reported in the consolidated financial statements could change significantly 
the following sections discuss the accounting policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
valuation of investments a large portion of our investments is reflected at fair value in the statements of financial position based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services 
however  when such information is not available  for example  with respect to private placement fixed maturity securities which comprise of our investments as of december   fair value is estimated  typically by using a discounted cash flow model  which considers current market credit spreads for publicly traded issues with similar terms by companies of comparable credit quality 
consequently  changes in estimated future cash flows or in our assessment of the issuer s credit quality will result in changes in fair value estimates 
fixed maturities and equity securities classified as available for sale are carried at these fair values and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of equity 
in addition  fixed maturities and equity securities classified as available for sale or held to maturity are subject to our review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors we consider in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  generally greater than six months  the reasons for the decline in value  credit event or interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is reduced to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
this corresponding charge is referred to as an impairment and is reflected in realized investment gains losses  net in the statements of operations 
the level of impairment losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
commercial loans  which comprise of our investments as of december   are carried primarily at unpaid principal balances  net of unamortized discounts and an allowance for losses 
this allowance includes a loan specific portion as well as a portfolio reserve for incurred but not specifically identified losses 
the loan specific portion is based on management s judgment as to ultimate collectibility of loan principal 
the portfolio reserve is based on a number of factors  such as historical experience and portfolio diversification 
similar to impairment losses discussed above  the allowance for losses can be expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and decrease when economic conditions improve 
see realized investment gains and general account investments for a discussion of our investment portfolio and related results  including policies regarding other than temporary declines in investment value 

table of contents policyholder liabilities the liability for future policy benefits is the largest liability included in our statements of financial position  of total liabilities as of december  changes in this liability are generally reflected in the policyholders benefits caption in our statements of operations 
this liability is primarily comprised of the present value of estimated future payments to holders of life insurance and annuity products where the timing and amount of payment depends on policyholder mortality  surrender or retirement experience 
for traditional participating life insurance products of our closed block business  the mortality and interest rate assumptions we apply are those used to calculate the policies guaranteed cash surrender values 
for life insurance and annuity products of our financial services businesses  expected mortality is generally based on the company s historical experience or standard industry tables 
interest rate assumptions are based on factors such as market conditions and expected investment returns 
although mortality and interest rate assumptions are locked in upon the issuance of new insurance or annuity business with fixed and guaranteed terms  significant changes in experience or assumptions may require us to provide for expected future losses on a product by establishing premium deficiency reserves 
our liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  which is less than of total liabilities as of december   includes estimates of claims that we believe have been incurred  but have not yet been reported ibnr as of the balance sheet date  primarily attributable to our group insurance segment 
consistent with industry accounting practice  we do not establish loss reserves until a loss has occurred 
these ibnr estimates  and estimates of the amounts of loss we will ultimately incur on reported claims  which are based in part on our historical experience  are regularly adjusted to reflect actual claims experience 
when actual experience differs from our previous estimate  the resulting difference will be included in our reported results for the period of the change in estimate in the policyholders benefits caption in our statements of operations 
on an ongoing basis  trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of claim reserve levels 
deferred policy acquisition costs for most life insurance and annuity products that we sell  we defer costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new business to the extent these costs are deemed recoverable from future profits  and we record these costs as an asset known as deferred policy acquisition costs or dac  which is of total assets as of december  we amortize this dac asset over the expected lives of the contracts  based on the level and timing of either estimated profits or premiums  depending on the type of contract 
for products with amortization based on estimated profits  the amortization rate is periodically updated to reflect current period experience or changes in assumptions that affect future profitability  such as lapse rates  investment returns  mortality experience  expense margins and surrender charges 
however  for products with amortization based on future premiums  the amortization rate is locked in when the product is sold 
expected profitability is a significant element in evaluating deferred policy acquisition costs related to annuity products 
deferred policy acquisition costs related to annuity products are evaluated quarterly by comparing our actual profitability to our expectations 
expected profitability considers  among other assumptions  our estimate of future asset returns that determine the future fees we will earn  the costs we expect to incur associated with minimum death benefit and other contractual guarantees  as well as other profitability factors 
if actual asset returns do not differ significantly from our expectations  they do not result in a change in the rate of amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
where actual asset returns differ significantly from expectations  future asset return assumptions are evaluated using a reversion to mean approach 
under the reversion to mean approach  we consider historical returns over a period of time and project returns for a future four year period so that the investments underlying the annuities grow at a targeted return for the entire period 
a calculated rate of return over the four future years  which we refer to as the look forward period  is determined so that this calculated rate  together with the actual rate of return for the historical period  produces the targeted return for the entire period 
if the calculated rate of return is consistent with our range of expectations in light of market conditions  we use it to project the asset growth for the next four years 
if the calculated rate of return is not supported by our current expectations  we adjust the rate of return for purposes of these computations 
for contract years after the look forward period  we project asset growth using our long term rate  currently an annual blended rate of return  which reflects an assumed rate of return of for equity type assets 
beginning in the second quarter of and continuing throughout  we utilized a rate of return lower than the calculated return  which contributed to our additional amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the second and third quarters of the equity rate of return used in the immediate four year look forward period varies by product  but was under for all of our variable annuity products for our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs as of december  for the average remaining life of our variable annuity contracts in force as of december   our evaluation of deferred policy acquisition costs is based on a annual blended rate of return that reflects an 
table of contents assumed rate of return of for equity type assets 
deterioration in market conditions may result in increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  while further improvement in market conditions may result in a decrease in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
these changes in dac balances are included as a component of general and administrative expenses in our statements of operations 
see insurance division individual life and annuities for discussion of the impact of dac amortization on our results of our annuities businesses  including a reduction in amortization recorded in reflecting an increase in our estimate of future gross profits on variable annuities and increases in amortization recorded in and reflecting our decreases in estimates of future gross profits during those years 
goodwill we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of december of each year and more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
impairment testing requires us to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
the determination of a reporting unit s fair value is based on management s best estimate  which generally considers the unit s expected future earnings and market based earning multiples of peer companies 
as of december   we have million of goodwill reflected on our statement of financial position 
reserves for contingencies a contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of uncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence of future events 
under gaap  reserves for contingencies are required to be established when the future event is probable and its impact can be reasonably estimated 
an example is the establishment of a reserve for losses in connection with an unresolved legal matter 
the initial reserve reflects management s best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised accordingly as facts and circumstances change and  ultimately  when the matter is brought to closure 
other significant estimates in addition to the items discussed above  the application of gaap requires management to make other estimates and assumptions 
for example  accounting for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits requires estimates of future returns on plan assets  expected increases in compensation levels and trends in health care costs 
see corporate and other operations for a discussion of our pension assumptions and related returns 
another example is the recognition of deferred tax assets  which depends on management s assumption that future earnings will be sufficient to realize the deferred benefit 
this is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies adopted accounting for stock options employee stock options issued during and are accounted for using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting to stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  an allowable alternative method under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for stock based compensation 
under apb no 
 we did not recognize any stock based compensation expense for employee stock options as all employee stock options had an exercise price equal to the market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
effective january   we changed our accounting for employee stock options to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended  prospectively for all new awards granted to employees on or after january  under these provisions  the fair value of all employee stock options awarded on or after january   is included in the determination of net income  but not for options awarded prior thereto 
accordingly  the amount we include in the determination of net income is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since inception of the employee stock option plan 
the fair value of employee stock options issued prior to january  was estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
for options issued on or after january   the fair value of each option was estimated using a binomial option pricing model 
both option pricing models consider the following assumptions in estimating fair value dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected life of the option 
if we had accounted for all employee stock options under the fair value based accounting method  net income of the 
table of contents financial services businesses for the year ended december   would have been reduced by million or

per share of common stock on a basic and diluted basis  respectively 
the net income of the closed block business for the year ended december   would have been reduced by million with no change in earnings per share of the class b stock

for the financial services businesses  we analyze our segments operating performance using a non gaap measure we call adjusted operating income 
results of the closed block business for all periods are evaluated and presented only in accordance with gaap 
we calculate adjusted operating income for the segments of the financial services businesses by adjusting our income from continuing operations before income taxes to exclude the following items realized investment gains  net of losses  and related charges and adjustments  the contribution to income loss of divested businesses that have been or will be sold or exited that do not qualify for discontinued operations accounting treatment under gaap  life insurance sales practices remedies and costs  and demutualization costs and expenses 

table of contents the contributions to income loss of wind down businesses that we have not divested remain in adjusted operating income 
the excluded items are important to an understanding of our overall results of operations 
adjusted operating income is not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap  and our definition of adjusted operating income may differ from that used by other companies 
however  we believe that the presentation of adjusted operating income as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of the financial services businesses 
adjusted operating income excludes net realized investment gains and losses 
a significant element of realized losses is impairments and losses from sales of credit impaired securities  the timing of which depends largely on market credit cycles and can vary considerably across periods 
the timing of other sales that would result in gains or losses is largely subject to our discretion and influenced by market opportunities 
trends in the underlying profitability of our businesses can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions 
adjusted operating income excludes life insurance sales practices remedies and costs relating to the settlement of individual life insurance sales practices issues for the period from through because they relate to a substantial and identifiable non recurring event 
adjusted operating income excludes the results of divested business  which are not indicative of our future operating results 
adjusted operating income also excludes demutualization costs and expenses as they are directly related to demutualization and would distort the trends associated with ongoing operations

table of contents on may   we completed our acquisition of skandia us inc  which included american skandia for a total purchase price of billion 
beginning may   the results of american skandia have been included in our consolidated results and are included as a component of our annuity business discussed below 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition and purchase price allocation 
adjusted operating income to annual comparison 
the decrease in adjusted operating income for the segment s individual life insurance business is primarily the result of claims experience  net of reinsurance  less favorable than in the prior year  partially offset by the favorable impact of increases in the market value of variable life insurance assets 
results of the segment s individual annuity business for included adjusted operating income of million from the initial eight months of operations of american skandia  which consisted of revenues of million and total benefits and expenses of million 
american skandia s revenues consisted primarily of policy charges and fee income of million and asset management and service fees of million 
benefits and expenses consisted primarily of general and administrative expenses of million  including million of amortization of the value of business acquired asset voba established in purchase accounting  which amounted to million as of the date of acquisition  and guaranteed minimum death benefit payments of million 
adjusted operating income of the segment s individual annuity business  excluding american skandia  increased million  from a loss  on an adjusted operating income basis  of million in to income of million in adjusted operating income for included a million reduction in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs due to our increased estimate of future gross profits on variable annuities reflecting market value increases in underlying assets 
this benefit to adjusted operating income was largely offset by a million charge to strengthen reserves for our periodic income annuities 
results for included charges totaling million for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  reflecting our lower estimates of future gross profits resulting from greater expected costs from minimum death benefit guarantees and lower expected fees under individual annuity contracts due to declines in asset values 
to annual comparison 
results for the segment s individual life insurance business for benefited from a decline in operating expenses  reflecting savings that we continue to realize from our field management and agency restructuring program implemented in  for which that year s expenses included million of implementation costs 
additionally  results of our individual life insurance business for benefited from increased investment income  primarily from an increase in the level of invested assets 
however  these items were partially offset by less favorable mortality experience in  as well as a million increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  primarily due to a market decline and related policy lapses associated with declines in variable life insurance account values 
results for included million of net losses from insurance claims arising out of the september   terrorist attacks on the us results of our annuity business in included charges totaling million for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs discussed above 
results for included similar charges for additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs totaling million 
a decline in fee revenues in from our variable annuity products due to a decrease in average account values was partially offset by a decrease in operating expenses resulting from our expense management efforts 
revenues to annual comparison 
the segment s individual life insurance business reported revenues  as shown in the table above under operating results  of billion in compared to billion  a million decrease 
premiums decreased million  from million in to million in  reflecting approximately million in decreased premiums on term insurance we issued under policy provisions to customers who previously had lapsing variable life insurance policies with us  partially offset by increased sales and growth of our in force block of term insurance products 
revenues from the segment s individual annuity business increased million  from million in to billion in  which included revenues of million from american skandia 
revenues of the segment s existing individual annuity business declined million  from million in to million in  due primarily to an million decrease in policy charges and fees as  despite a year to year increase  the average market value of variable annuity customer accounts declined in from 
table of contents to annual comparison 
the segment s individual life insurance business reported revenues of billion in  compared to billion in  a million increase 
net investment income increased million from million in to million in  primarily from an increase in the level of invested assets 
commissions and other income increased million  from million in to million in  primarily due to an increased level of reinsurance activity 
premiums amounted to million in  essentially unchanged from the prior year 
revenues from our individual annuity business declined million  from million in to million in policy charges and fees and asset management fees decreased million from million in to million in  driven primarily from our variable annuity products  reflecting a decline in the average market value of customer accounts on which our fees are based 
net investment income declined million  from million in to million in  primarily due to lower yields on our investment portfolio 
these declines were partially offset by higher premiums resulting from increased sales of our immediate income annuity product 
benefits and expenses to annual comparison 
benefits and expenses  as shown in the table above under operating results  of the segment s individual life insurance business increased million from billion in to billion in the increase reflects a million increase in policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves  from million in to million in  as well as an increase in employee termination and related costs 
the increase in policyholder benefits and related changes in reserves came primarily from claims experience  net of reinsurance  less favorable than the prior year  partially offset by decreased policy reserves on term insurance  corresponding to the decreased premiums discussed above 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs  due primarily to less favorable claims experience and lower policy surrenders 
benefits and expenses of the segment s individual annuity business increased million  from million in to million in  which included million of expenses related to american skandia 
benefits and expenses of the segment s existing individual annuity business decreased million  from million in to million in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs declined million from to  primarily as a result of the changes in our estimated future gross profits as discussed above 
partially offsetting this was a million increase in policyholder benefits and related change in reserves  reflecting the million charge to strengthen reserves for our periodic income annuities discussed above  which resulted from refinements in our calculation of these reserves 
benefits and expenses of our individual annuity business include million of guaranteed minimum death benefits in of which million is associated with the american skandia business 
effective january   we adopted sop  which requires the recognition of a liability for a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb feature  as well as a change in the valuation and presentation of our liability associated with a market value adjustment mva feature  both of which are contained in certain of our annuity contracts

on that basis  new annualized premiums from our operations in japan were million in  including million from gibraltar life  compared to million in when gibraltar life s sales force sold policies for our existing japanese insurance operation during a portion of the year  pending the completion of gibraltar life s reorganization 
since the first quarter of  the gibraltar life sales force has distributed only gibraltar life products 
sales in japan other than gibraltar life during were particularly strong due to anticipated premium rate increases that took effect on april  and october  sales in all other countries  also on a constant exchange rate basis  decreased million as a result of a decrease from our operations in taiwan and korea  where sales were affected by premium rate increases in investment margins and other profitability factors many of our insurance products sold in international markets provide for the buildup of cash values for the policyholder at mandated guaranteed interest rates 
the spread between the actual investment returns and these guaranteed rates of return to the policyholder is an element of the profit or loss that we will experience on these products 
interest rates guaranteed in our japanese insurance contracts are regulated by japanese authorities 
between july   and april   we guaranteed premium rates using an interest rate of on most of the products we sold in japan even though the yield on japanese government and high quality corporate bonds was less than that much of this time 
this resulted in some negative investment spreads for much of this business over this period 
as a consequence  our profitability with respect to these products in japan during that period resulted primarily from margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges 
in response to the low interest rate environment  japanese regulators approved a reduction in the required rates for most of the products we sell to in april  which results in our charging higher premiums on new business for the same amount of insurance 
while this has also resulted in an improvement in investment spreads  these spreads continued to have a negative impact on adjusted operating income from our japanese insurance operation other than gibraltar life in   and and the profitability of these products in japan continues to result primarily from margins on mortality  morbidity  and expense charges 
in and  japanese regulators approved further reductions in the required interest rates applicable to most of the products we sell 
as a result  we increased premium rates on many of our products sold in japan when the new rates were implemented  in april  october  and august for some products 
additionally  interest rates on our guaranteed products sold in korea are regulated by korean authorities  who approved  in april  january  april  and january  reductions in the required interest rates credited for most of the products we sell  allowing us to charge higher premiums on new business for the same amount of insurance 
while these actions enhance our ability to set rates commensurate with available investment returns  the major sources of profitability on our products in korea  as in japan  are margins on mortality  morbidity and expense charges rather than investment spreads 
we base premiums and cash values in most countries in which we operate on mandated mortality tables 
our mortality experience in the international insurance segment on an overall basis for  and was well within our pricing assumptions and below the guaranteed levels reflected in the premiums we charge

results of the property and casualty insurance operations have been reclassified as a divested business for all periods presented 
historically  the individual life and annuities segment has been compensated for property and casualty insurance products sold through its distribution network 
following the sale of the property and casualty insurance operations  prudential agents will have continued access to non proprietary property and casualty products under distribution agreements entered into with the purchasers of these businesses  and therefore  the individual life and annuities segment will continue to be compensated for sales of these products  although the extent of these revenues cannot be predicted 
in addition  certain expenses incurred at the corporate level that previously were allocated to the property and casualty insurance segment have been reclassified to corporate and other operations  for all periods presented

at the end of each year  the board of directors of prudential insurance determines the dividends payable for participating policies for the following year based on its statutory results and past experience  including investment income  net realized investment gains over a number of years  mortality experience and other factors 
as required by gaap  we developed an actuarial calculation of the timing of the maximum future earnings from the policies included in the closed block  and if actual cumulative earnings in any given period are greater than the cumulative earnings we expect  we will record this excess as a policyholder dividend obligation 
we will subsequently pay this excess to 
table of contents closed block policyholders as an additional dividend unless it is otherwise offset by future closed block performance that is less favorable than we originally expected 
the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will include any policyholder dividend obligations that we recognize for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect in addition to the actual policyholder dividends declared by the board of directors of prudential insurance 
if cumulative performance is less favorable than we expected  the policyholder dividends we charge to expense within the closed block business will be the actual dividends declared by the board of directors 
subsequent to the date of demutualization  there was no required charge to expense to recognize a policyholder dividend obligation for the excess of actual cumulative earnings in any given period over the cumulative earnings we expect 
however  net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the closed block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation to be paid to closed block policyholders  unless otherwise offset by future experience  with an offsetting amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  and  as such  we have a policyholder dividend obligation to closed block policyholders of billion recorded as of december  operating results management does not consider adjusted operating income to assess operating performance of the closed block business

we perform impairment reviews on an ongoing basis and record an impairment charge when we determine that a decline in value is other than temporary 
the level of impairments generally reflects economic conditions and is expected to increase when economic conditions worsen and to decrease when economic conditions improve 
we may realize additional credit related losses through sales of investments pursuant to our credit risk and portfolio management objectives 
we require most issuers of private fixed maturity securities to pay us make whole yield maintenance payments when they prepay the securities 
prepayments are driven by factors specific to the activities of our borrowers as much as by the interest rate environment 

table of contents we use derivative contracts to hedge the risk that changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates will affect the market value of certain investments 
we also use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk that unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates will reduce us dollar equivalent earnings generated by certain of our non us businesses 
derivative contracts also include forward purchases and sales of to be announced mortgage backed securities primarily related to our mortgage dollar roll program 
the vast majority of these derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  and consequently we recognize the changes in fair value of such contracts from period to period in current earnings  although we do not necessarily account for the hedged assets or liabilities the same way 
accordingly  realized investment gains and losses from our hedging activities contribute significantly to fluctuations in net income 
the comparisons below discuss realized investment gains  net of losses and related charges and adjustments 
related charges  which are not applicable to the closed block business  pertain to policyholder dividends  deferred policy acquisition costs and reserves for future policy benefits 
a percentage of net realized investment gains on specified gibraltar life assets is required to be paid as dividends to gibraltar life policyholders 
we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products based on estimated gross profits  which include net realized investment gains on the underlying invested assets  and the related charge for amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs represents the amortization related to net realized investment gains 
we adjust the reserves for some of our policies when cash flows related to these policies are affected by net realized investment gains  and the related charge for reserves for future policy benefits represents that adjustment 
the changes in these related charges from one period to another may be disproportionate to the changes in realized investment gains  net of losses  evaluated over several periods 
a portion of realized gains  pertaining to certain derivative results  is included in adjusted operating income 
pursuant to a currency hedging program  we execute forward sale contracts in the hedged currencies in exchange for us dollars at a specified exchange rate 
the maturities of these contracts correspond with future periods in which non us earnings are expected to be generated 
these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under gaap 
all resulting profits or losses from such contracts  including mark to market adjustments of open contracts  are included in realized investment gains losses  net 
when the contracts are terminated in the same period that the expected earnings emerge  the resulting positive or negative cash flow is included in adjusted operating income 
in addition  we utilize interest and currency swaps to manage interest and currency exchange rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities  including duration mismatches 
for the swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  mark to market adjustments of open contracts as well as periodic settlements are included in realized investment gains losses  net

general account investments we maintain a diversified investment portfolio in our insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our financial services businesses and the closed block business  as well as our other general liabilities 
our general account does not include assets of our securities brokerage  securities trading  banking operations  assets of our asset management operations managed for third parties  and separate account assets for which the customer assumes risks of ownership 
the general account portfolio is managed pursuant to the distinct objectives of the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
the primary investment objectives of the financial services businesses include matching the liability characteristics of the major products and other obligations of the company  and maximizing the portfolio book yield within risk constraints 
the primary investment objectives of the closed block business include providing for the reasonable dividend expectations of the participating policyholders within the closed block business and the class b shareholders  and 
table of contents maximizing total return and preserving principal  within risk constraints  while matching the liability characteristics of the major products in the closed block business 
management of investments we design asset mix strategies for our general account to match the characteristics of our products and other obligations and seek to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with the estimated interest rate sensitivity of the product liabilities 
we achieve income objectives through asset liability management and strategic and tactical asset allocations within a disciplined risk management framework 
our asset allocation also reflects our desire for broad diversification across asset classes  sectors and issuers 
the investment committee of our board of directors oversees our proprietary investments 
it also reviews performance and risk positions quarterly 
our senior vice president  asset liability and risk management  approves the investment policy for the general account assets of our insurance subsidiaries and oversees the investment process for our general account 
under his direction  the asset liability and risk management group works with our business units to develop investment objectives  performance factors and measures and asset allocation ranges 
the asset liability and risk management group also works closely with each of our business units to ensure that the specific characteristics of our products are incorporated into its processes 
the asset liability and risk management group has the authority to initiate tactical shifts within exposure ranges approved annually by the investment committee 
the investment management segment manages virtually all of our investments  other than those of our international insurance segment  under the direction of the asset liability and risk management group 
our international insurance segment manages the majority of its investments locally 
asset liability management the asset liability and risk management group uses a disciplined  risk controlled approach to asset liability management 
the methodology focuses on aligning assets to the effective sensitivity of the cash flow and return requirements of our liabilities 
the asset liability and risk management group consults with the product experts in the businesses on an ongoing basis to arrive at asset liability matching policies and decisions 
we adjust this dynamic process as products change  as we develop new products and as changes in the market environment occur 
we develop asset strategies for specific classes of product liabilities and attributed or accumulated surplus  each with distinct risk characteristics 
most of our products can be categorized in to the following three classes interest crediting products for which the rates credited to customers are periodically adjusted to reflect market and competitive forces and actual investment experience  such as fixed annuities  participating individual and experience rated group products in which customers participate in actual investment and business results through annual dividends  interest or return of premium  and guaranteed products for which there are price or rate guarantees for the life of the contract  such as gics 
we determine a target asset mix for each product class  which we reflect in our investment policies 
our asset liability management process has permitted us to manage interest sensitive products successfully through several market cycles 
portfolio composition our investment portfolio consists primarily of public and private fixed maturity securities  commercial loans  equity securities and other invested assets 
portfolio composition is a critical element of our investment management process 
the composition of our general account reflects  within the discipline provided by our risk management approach  our need for competitive results and the diverse selection of investment alternatives available through our investment management segment 
the size of our portfolio enables us to invest in asset classes that may be unavailable to the typical investor

investment results the overall income yield on our general account investments after investment expenses  excluding realized investment gains losses  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decline in yield on the portfolio in from is primarily attributable to reinvestment activities over the last two years in a declining interest rate environment

the yield on the financial services businesses reflects the income yield on the investment portfolio of our japanese insurance operations  which was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in yield on the japanese insurance portfolio in from is primarily attributable to the redeployment of excess cash and investment in us mortgage backed bonds during the net investment income yield attributable to the closed block business was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the change in yield between periods was primarily due to declines in fixed maturities primarily attributable to reinvestment activities in a declining interest rate environment  partially offset by more favorable results from limited partnerships within other investments 
continuation of the current low interest rate environment will result in our reinvestment of maturing securities at lower rates and would reduce the yield we are able to earn on our investments  which support our obligations for certain products  including traditional whole life insurance  fixed annuities and guaranteed investment contracts 
this reduction in yield would also have a corresponding impact on the spread  which is the difference between the yield on our investments and the amounts that we are required to pay our customers related to these products and which could have a negative impact on our future profitability

fixed maturity securities investment mix our fixed maturity securities portfolio consists of publicly traded and private placed debt securities across an array of industry categories 
our international portfolios are predominantly foreign government securities 
we manage our public portfolio to a risk profile directed by the asset liability and risk management group and  in the case of our international insurance portfolios  to a profile that reflects local market regulations and our investment competencies in these markets 
we seek to employ relative value analysis both in credit selection and in purchasing and selling securities 
the total return that we earn on the portfolio will be reflected both as investment income and also as realized gains or losses on investments 
we use our private placement and asset backed portfolios to enhance the diversification and yield of our overall fixed maturity portfolio 
within our domestic portfolios  we maintain a private fixed income portfolio that is larger than the industry average as a percentage of total fixed income holdings 
over the last several years  our investment staff has directly originated more than half of our annual private placement originations

impairments of fixed maturity securities we maintain separate monitoring processes for public and private fixed maturities and create watch lists to highlight securities that require special scrutiny and management 
our public fixed maturity asset managers formally review all public fixed maturity holdings on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration whether due to ratings downgrades  unexpected price variances  and or industry specific concerns 
we classify public fixed maturity securities of issuers that have defaulted as securities not in good standing and all other public watch list assets as closely monitored 
for private placements our credit and portfolio management processes help ensure prudent controls over valuation and management 
we have separate pricing and authorization processes to establish checks and balances for new investments 
we apply consistent standards of credit analysis and due diligence for all transactions  whether they originate through our own in house origination staff or through agents 
our regional offices closely monitor the portfolios in their regions 
we set all valuation standards centrally  and we assess the fair value of all investments quarterly 
our private fixed maturity asset managers conduct specific servicing tests on each investment on an ongoing basis to determine whether the investment is in compliance or should be placed on the watch list or assigned an early warning classification 
we assign early warning classifications to those issuers that have failed a servicing test or experienced a minor covenant default  and we continue to monitor them for improvement or deterioration 
in certain situations  the general account benefits from negotiated rate increases or fees resulting from a covenant breach 
we assign closely monitored status to those investments that have been recently restructured or for which restructuring is a possibility due to substantial credit deterioration or material covenant defaults 
we classify as not in good standing securities of issuers that are in more severe conditions  for example  bankruptcy or payment default 
we classify our fixed maturity securities as either held to maturity or available for sale 
securities classified as held to maturity are those securities where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
these securities are reflected at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of financial position 
securities not classified as held to maturity are considered available for sale  and  as a result  we record unrealized gains and losses to the extent that amortized cost is different from estimated fair value 
all held to maturity securities and all available for sale securities with unrealized losses are subject to our review to identify other than temporary impairments in value 
in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary  we consider several factors including  but not limited to  the following whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline generally greater than six months  the reasons for the decline in value credit event or interest rate related  our ability and intent to hold our investment for a period of time to allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition of and near term prospects of the issuer 
when we determine that there is an other than temporary impairment  we record a write down to estimated fair value which reduces the cost basis 
the new cost basis of an impaired security is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value 
estimated fair values for fixed maturities  other than private placement securities  are based on quoted market prices or prices obtained from independent pricing services 
estimated fair values for private placement fixed maturities are determined primarily by using a discounted cash flow model which considers the current market spreads between the us treasury yield curve and corporate bond yield curve  adjusted for type of issue  its current credit quality and its remaining average life 
the estimated fair value of certain non performing private placement fixed maturities is based on management s estimates

table of contents commercial loans investment mix we originate domestic commercial mortgages using dedicated investment staff and a network of independent companies through our various regional offices across the country 
all loans are underwritten consistently to company standards using our proprietary quality rating system that has been developed from our experience in real estate and mortgage lending 
our loan portfolio strategy emphasizes diversification by property type and geographic location 
consumer loans are loans extended by gibraltar life to individuals for financing purchases of consumer goods and services and are guaranteed by third party guarantor companies 
ongoing surveillance of the portfolio is performed and loans are placed on watch list status based on a predefined set of criteria 
we place loans on early warning status in cases where we detect that the physical condition of the property  the financial situation of the borrower or tenant or other market factors could lead to a loss of principal or interest 
we classify loans as closely monitored when there is a collateral deficiency or other credit events that will lead to a potential loss of principal or interest 
loans not in good standing are those loans where there is a high probability of loss of principal  such as when the loan is in the process of foreclosure or the borrower is in bankruptcy 
in our domestic operations  our workout and special servicing professionals manage the loans on the watch list 
in our international portfolios  we monitor delinquency in consumer loans on a pool basis and evaluate any servicing relationship and guarantees the same way we do for commercial loans

we define a non performing loan as a loan for which it is probable that amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
valuation allowances for a non performing loan are recorded based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent

prudential financial capital adequacy financial services businesses prudential financial seeks to capitalize its businesses consistent with its risk  ratings objectives and regulatory requirements  all of which are considered when determining the aggregate capital requirements for the company 
our ratings targets are aa aa aa for s p  moody s and fitch  respectively  and a for am best for our core domestic life insurance companies 
our debt rating targets are a for s p  moody s and fitch and a for am best for prudential financial 
the primary components of capitalization for the financial services businesses consist of the equity we attribute to the financial services businesses  excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments  the contractual obligations of holders of our equity security units to purchase prudential financial  inc common stock in november  and outstanding borrowings of the financial services businesses that are ascribed to general corporate purposes as discussed below under financing activities 
based on these components  the capital position of the financial services businesses as of december   was as follows december  in millions attributed equity excluding unrealized gains and losses on investments equity security units debt used for general corporate purposes total capital 
table of contents as shown in the table above  as of december   the financial services businesses had approximately billion in capital  all of which was available to support the aggregate capital requirements of the businesses in its three divisions and its corporate and other operations 
based on our assessment of these businesses and operations  we believe that the capital of the financial services businesses as of december   exceeds the amount required to support its business risks 
in addition  we believe this capital position  combined with our borrowing capacity  gives us substantial financial flexibility 
the risk based capital rbc ratio is the primary measure by which we evaluate the capital adequacy of prudential insurance  which encompasses businesses of both the financial services businesses and the closed block business 
we manage prudential insurance s rbc ratio to a level consistent with our ratings targets for it 
rbc is determined by statutory formulas that consider risks related to the type and quality of the invested assets  insurance related risks associated with prudential insurance s products  interest rate risks and general business risks 
the rbc ratio calculations are intended to assist insurance regulators in measuring the adequacy of prudential insurance s statutory capitalization 
as of december   prudential insurance s rbc ratio was above the level that we believe is required to meet our ratings targets 
prudential insurance s statutory capital as of december   included approximately billion associated with the insurance policies in the closed block business that we believe will not be necessary to cover the risk of the closed block business 
we have commenced a process of entering into reinsurance arrangements that will enable us to redeploy this capital 
in addition  its statutory capital included million to million relating to our on going domestic life insurance business that we believe is not necessary to cover its risks due to changes to statutory minimum reserve requirements and reinsurance arrangements with respect to such business entered into in the second half of we expect to use billion of this capital billion to billion to support the acquisition of cigna s retirement business 
this will leave between million and million of capital beyond that which we believe is consistent with maintaining or improving our ratings 
similarly  we believe that our international insurance subsidiaries have capital of million to million in excess of the amounts needed to maintain or improve their ratings and that such capital which generally is not distributable to prudential financial without regulatory approval can be deployed in the growth of our businesses 
we used a portion of the million to million to fund the acquisition of hyundai 
we also consider additional borrowing capacity in evaluating the capital position of the financial services businesses 
we measure this additional borrowing capacity by calculating the amount of additional borrowings the financial services businesses could incur for general corporate purposes before we reach our corporate debt to capital ratio limit  which is currently 
we believe that a ratio of or less is currently consistent with our ratings targets 
as of december   this ratio was  indicating that the financial services businesses could have incurred billion of additional borrowings for general corporate purposes as of that date without exceeding the limit 
as of december   the overall outstanding borrowings of the financial services businesses included approximately billion the proceeds of which were temporarily invested in cash and short term investments or loans to affiliates 
a reallocation of these proceeds to general corporate purposes would be considered in calculating the ratio of corporate debt to total capital and would reduce the billion of additional borrowings available for general corporate purposes 
uses of capital cigna retirement acquisition 
as noted above  we plan to use billion of the billion to billion of the capital described above to fund the acquisition of cigna s retirement business  which is expected to close during the first half of share repurchases 
during the fourth quarter of  the company acquired million shares of its common stock at a total cost of approximately million 
for the year ended december   we repurchased million shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately billion 
on february   prudential financial s board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which prudential financial is authorized to purchase up to billion of its outstanding common stock in the timing and amount of any repurchases under the authorization will be determined by management based on market conditions and other considerations  and such repurchases may be effected in the open market or through negotiated transactions 
this stock repurchase program supersedes all previous repurchase programs 

table of contents demutualization consideration 
during  prudential financial paid out million in demutualization consideration to eligible policyholders whom we have located since the time of demutualization and to governmental authorities in respect of other eligible policyholders we continue to be unable to locate 
we remain obligated to disburse additional payments of million to governmental authorities to the extent we are still unable to locate remaining eligible policyholders within a prescribed period of time specified by state escheat laws 
these laws historically required remittance to the states in periods that typically ranged from three to seven years  but many states have enacted new legislation that reduces the escheatment time period and a number of other states are pursuing similar legislation 
liabilities relating to demutualization consideration payments were established at the time of demutualization in for an estimate of expected payments by period see contractual obligations 
in addition  at the time of demutualization  prudential financial made a contribution of billion to prudential insurance to cover demutualization consideration for eligible policyholders who received policy credits as a part of our demutualization 
the contribution was financed with proceeds from the purchase by prudential insurance of a series of notes issued by prudential financial with market rates of interest and maturities ranging from nineteen months to three years 
during  notes totaling million matured 
of the remaining notes  million matures in and million matures in restrictions on dividends and returns of capital from subsidiaries our insurance and various other companies are subject to regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends and on other transfers of funds to affiliates 
with respect to prudential insurance  new jersey insurance law provides that  except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions  all dividends or distributions paid by prudential insurance may be declared or paid only from unassigned surplus  as determined pursuant to statutory accounting principles  less unrealized investment gains and revaluation of assets 
as of december  and december   prudential insurance s unassigned surplus deficit was  million and million  respectively 
there were applicable adjustments for unrealized investment gains of million as of december  and no adjustments as of december  there was no revaluation of assets for purposes of the law referred to above regarding dividends and distributions in either year 
prudential insurance also must notify the new jersey insurance regulator of its intent to pay a dividend 
if the dividend  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  would exceed a specified statutory limit  prudential insurance must also obtain a non disapproval from the new jersey insurance regulator 
the current statutory limitation applicable to new jersey life insurers generally is the greater of of the prior calendar year s statutory surplus or the prior calendar year s statutory net gain from operations excluding realized capital gains and losses 
in addition to these regulatory limitations  the terms of the ihc debt contain restrictions potentially limiting dividends by prudential insurance applicable to the financial services businesses in the event the closed block business is in financial distress and other circumstances 
prudential insurance provided no dividends to prudential financial in the laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where our other insurance companies are domiciled are similar  but not identical  to new jersey s 
pursuant to gibraltar life s reorganization  in addition to regulatory restrictions  there are certain restrictions on gibraltar life s ability to pay dividends to prudential financial 
there are regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by prudential life insurance company ltd prudential of japan 
we anticipate that it will be several years before these restrictions will allow gibraltar and prudential of japan to pay dividends 
the ability of our asset management subsidiaries  and the majority of our other operating subsidiaries  to pay dividends is unrestricted 
liquidity of subsidiaries domestic insurance subsidiaries general liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations 
we manage the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of cash flows to meet all of our obligations 
liquidity is provided by a variety of sources  as described more fully below  including portfolios of liquid assets 
the investment portfolios of our domestic and foreign insurance operations are integral to the overall liquidity of those operations 
we segment our investment portfolios and employ an asset liability management approach specific to the requirements of our product lines 
this enhances the discipline applied in managing the liquidity  as well as the interest and credit risk profiles  of each portfolio in a manner consistent with the unique characteristics of the product liabilities 
liquidity is monitored through the use of internally developed benchmarks  which take into account the characteristics of the asset portfolio 
the results are affected substantially by the overall quality of our investments 

table of contents our domestic insurance companies flexibility and liquidity are enhanced through access to a variety of instruments available for funding and or to manage short term cash flow mismatches  including securities lending and repurchase agreements  commercial paper issued through prudential funding  llc  discussed below  medium and long term debt  common stock and other capital securities 
although our domestic insurance companies generate adequate cash flow to meet the needs of their normal operations  they may incur indebtedness from time to time to fund expansion  investment opportunities  temporary cash flow timing mismatches and the retirement of debt 
cash flow from operations the principal sources of liquidity of prudential insurance and our other domestic insurance subsidiaries are premiums and annuity considerations  investment and fee income and investment maturities and sales associated with our insurance  annuities and guaranteed products operations 
principal uses of liquidity relate to benefits  claims  dividends paid to policyholders  and payments to policyholders and contract holders in connection with surrenders  withdrawals and net policy loan activity 
uses of liquidity also include commissions  general and administrative expenses  purchases of investments  and repayments in connection with financing activities 
in managing the liquidity of our domestic insurance operations  we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
we use surrender charges and other contract provisions to mitigate the extent  timing and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers from annuity contracts and deposit liabilities 
the following table sets forth withdrawal characteristics of our general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities based on statutory liability values as of the dates indicated 
december  december  amount of total amount of total in millions not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions subject to discretionary withdrawal  with adjustment with market value adjustment at market value at contract value  less surrender charge of or more subtotal subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value with no surrender charge or surrender charge of less than total annuity reserves and deposit liabilities gross account withdrawals for our domestic insurance operations products amounted to billion and billion for the years ending december  and  respectively 
these withdrawals include contractually scheduled maturities of general account guaranteed investment contracts of  million and  million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
since these contractual withdrawals  as well as the level of surrenders experienced  were consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  the associated cash outflows did not have an adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than our annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
annuity benefits under group annuity contracts are generally not subject to early withdrawal 
included in the table above are approximately of annuity reserves and deposit fund liabilities that are not subject to early withdrawal as of december  the domestic insurance operations cash flows from investment activities result from repayments of principal  proceeds from maturities and sales of invested assets and investment income  net of amounts reinvested 
the primary liquidity risks with respect to these flows are the risk of default by debtors  our counterparties willingness to extend repurchase and or securities lending arrangements  and market volatility 
we closely monitor and manage these risks through the credit risk management process and regular monitoring of our liquidity position 
we believe that cash flows from our insurance  annuity and guaranteed products operations are adequate to satisfy liquidity requirements of these operations based on our current liability structure and considering a variety of reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
the continued adequacy of this liquidity will depend upon factors including future securities market conditions  changes in interest rate levels and policyholder perceptions of our financial strength  which could lead to reduced cash inflows or increased cash outflows 

table of contents liquid assets liquid assets include cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable fixed maturities and public equity securities 
as of december   and  the domestic insurance operations had billion and billion in liquid assets  respectively 
as of december   billion  or of the fixed maturity securities held in our domestic insurance company general account portfolios were rated investment grade 
the remaining billion  or of fixed maturity investments were rated non investment grade 
we consider attributes of the various categories of liquid assets for example  type of asset and credit quality in calculating internal liquidity benchmark results in order to evaluate the adequacy of our domestic insurance operations liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios 
we believe that the liquidity profile of our assets is sufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements of reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios

prudential funding  llc prudential funding  llc prudential funding  a wholly owned subsidiary of prudential insurance  continues to serve as a source of financing for prudential insurance and its subsidiaries  as well as for other subsidiaries of prudential financial 
prudential funding operates under a support agreement with prudential insurance whereby prudential insurance has agreed to maintain prudential funding s positive tangible net worth at all times 
prudential funding borrows funds primarily through the direct issuance of commercial paper and private placement medium term notes 
prudential funding s outstanding loans to other subsidiaries of prudential financial are expected to decline over time as it transitions into a financing company primarily for prudential insurance and its remaining subsidiaries 
we anticipate that our other subsidiaries will borrow directly from third parties and from prudential financial  as well as from prudential funding from time to time 
the impact of prudential funding on liquidity is considered in the internal liquidity benchmarks of the domestic insurance operations 
as of december   prudential financial  prudential insurance and prudential funding had unsecured committed lines of credit totaling billion 
currently  prudential insurance and prudential funding have access to billion of the lines and there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  or december  for a further discussion on lines of credit  see financing activity lines of credit and other credit facilities 
international insurance subsidiaries in our international insurance operations  liquidity is provided through ongoing operations as well as portfolios of liquid assets 
in managing the liquidity and the interest and credit risk profiles of our international insurance portfolios  we employ a discipline similar to the discipline employed for our domestic insurance subsidiaries 
liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity benchmarks taking into account the liquidity of the asset portfolios 
similar to our domestic operations  in managing the liquidity of these operations we consider the risk of policyholder and contractholder withdrawals of funds earlier than our assumptions in selecting assets to support these contractual obligations 
as of december   and december   our international insurance subsidiaries had total insurance related liabilities other than dividends payable to policyholders of billion and billion  respectively 
of that amount  billion and billion are associated with gibraltar life  our largest international insurance subsidiary 
concurrent with our acquisition of gibraltar life in april  substantially all of its insurance liabilities were restructured  under a reorganization  to include special surrender penalties on existing policies 
these charges mitigate the extent  timing  and profitability impact of withdrawals of funds by customers and apply to billion and billion of gibraltar life s insurance related reserves as of december  and december   respectively 
the following table sets forth the schedule for each year ending march of special surrender charges on policies that were in force at the time of the acquisition policies issued by gibraltar life post acquisition are not subject to the above restructured policy surrender charge schedule 
policies issued post acquisition are subject to discretionary withdrawal at contract value  less applicable surrender charges  currently or more 
prudential of japan  with and billion of insurance related liabilities as of december  and december   respectively  is our second largest international insurance subsidiary 
prudential of japan did not 
table of contents have a material amount of general account annuity reserves and deposit liabilities subject to discretionary withdrawal as of december  or december  additionally  we believe that the individual life insurance policies sold by prudential of japan do not have significant withdrawal risk because policyholders may incur surrender charges and must undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
as of december  and december   our international insurance subsidiaries had cash and short term investments of approximately billion and billion  respectively  and fixed maturity investments classified as available for sale with fair values of billion and billion  respectively 
we believe that ongoing operations and the liquidity profile of our international insurance assets provide sufficient liquidity in reasonably foreseeable stress scenarios 
prudential securities group liquidity prudential securities group s assets totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
on july   we completed the combination of our retail brokerage business with wachovia 
as a result  we contributed billion of assets and corresponding liabilities and equity in return for our investment in wachovia securities 
prudential securities group continues to own our investment in wachovia securities as well as the retained wholly owned businesses 
the wholly owned businesses remaining in prudential securities group continue to maintain sufficiently liquid balance sheets consisting mostly of cash and cash equivalents  segregated client assets  short term collateralized receivables from clients and broker dealers  and collateralized loans to clients 
prudential securities group s total capitalization  including equity  subordinated debt and long term debt  was billion and billion as december  and december   respectively

the weighted average interest rate on prudential financial s long term debt  including the effect of interest rate hedging activity  was for the year ended december  effective april   we formally allocated billion of an unsecured committed line of credit expiring in october to prudential financial 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december  or december  for a discussion of our lines of credit  see lines of credit and other facilities below 
current capital markets activities principally consist of unsecured short term and long term debt borrowings issued at prudential funding and prudential financial and asset based or secured forms of financing 
the secured financing arrangements include transactions such as securities lending and repurchase agreements  which we generally use to finance liquid securities in our short term spread portfolios  primarily within prudential insurance

total general debt obligations increased by billion  or  from december   reflecting a billion net increase in long term debt and a billion net increase in short term debt 
the increase in long term debt was driven primarily by the issuance of billion of long term debt at prudential financial 
in addition  upon the adoption of fin  borrowings associated with our equity security units are now included in long term debt 
these increases were partially offset by million in a mortgage repayment and another million in long term notes becoming current at prudential funding 
the net increase in short term debt was driven by increased commercial paper issuance of billion at prudential funding and million at prudential financial 
these increases were partially offset by long term debt maturities of approximately million at prudential funding and a million surplus note maturity at prudential insurance 
in addition  direct third party borrowings of subsidiaries declined by million  primarily due to reduced bank borrowings of million at prudential securities group 
total long term limited and non recourse debt declined by million 
this change was due to a decline of approximately million resulting from the deconsolidation of certain entities upon adoption of fin and another million decline related to the sale of warehoused investments whose debt previously was included in our consolidated financial position 

table of contents asset based financing declined by billion primarily due to an billion decline at prudential securities group 
this was due to the combination of our retail brokerage operations with wachovia 
the decrease was also driven by the company s adoption of sfas  under which assets and liabilities associated with dollar roll activity are netted 
this resulted in a decrease of approximately billion in asset based financing outstanding at year end 
in addition  asset based financing also declined by approximately billion at prudential insurance

the facility expiring in may includes financial institutions  many of which are also among the financial institutions participating in the october facility 
we use these facilities primarily as back up liquidity lines for our commercial paper programs  and there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities as of december  or december  effective april   we formally allocated billion of the october facility to prudential financial 
as a result  prudential insurance and prudential funding now have access to the remaining billion in unsecured committed credit lines 
our ability to borrow under these facilities is conditioned on our continued satisfaction of customary conditions  including maintenance at all times by prudential insurance of total adjusted capital of at least billion based on statutory accounting principles prescribed under new jersey law

see footnote to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we offer various investment type products with contractually scheduled maturities through which customers deposit funds with us that typically provide for a rate of interest on the amount invested through the maturity of the contract 
these obligations are backed by our general account assets  and we bear all of the investment and asset liability management risk on these contracts 
examples of these types of products include gics  funding agreements  and annuities without life contingencies 
these liabilities are reflected within policyholders account balances on our consolidated statements of financial position and amount to billion as of december  the difference between our recorded liability and the total payment amount reflects billion of future interest to be credited 
prudential financial remains obligated to disburse demutualization consideration for eligible policyholders that we have been unable to locate 
to the extent we continue to be unable to locate these policyholders within a prescribed period of time specified by state escheat laws  typically three to seven years  the funds must be remitted to governmental authorities 
many states have enacted new legislation that reduces the escheatment time period and a number of other states are pursuing similar legislation 
the amounts reflected in the table above are reflective of state escheat laws as of december  these liabilities are reflected within other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position 
this amount represents our best estimate as of the date of this filing of our aggregated expected contributions to our non qualified pension and post retirement plans for we do not currently expect to make any contributions in to our qualified plans 
we have not included any amounts subsequent to  as these amounts are not readily determinable at this time

we enter into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these agreements are not material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
contractual commitments in connection with our commercial mortgage banking business  we originate commercial mortgage loans 
as of december   we had outstanding commercial mortgage loan commitments with borrowers of billion 
in certain of these transactions  we prearrange that we will sell the loan to an investor after we fund the loan 
as of december   million of our commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans are subject to such arrangements 
in connection with our discontinued consumer banking business  we have commitments under home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit to lend up to specified limits to customers 
it is anticipated that commitment amounts will only be partially drawn down based on overall customer usage patterns and  therefore  do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each credit decision on such commitments at least annually and have the ability to cancel or suspend such lines at our option 
the total commitments for home equity lines of credit and other lines of credit were billion  of which million remains available as of december  we also have other commitments  which primarily include commitments to fund investments 
these commitments amounted to billion as of december  
table of contents in connection with certain acquisitions  we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods  based upon the attainment by the acquired entity of defined operating objectives 
in accordance with gaap  we do not accrue contingent consideration obligations prior to the attainment of the objectives 
as of december   maximum potential future consideration pursuant to such arrangements  to be resolved over the following six years  is million 
any such payments would result in increases in intangible assets  including goodwill

deferred policy acquisition costs we capitalize costs that vary with and are related primarily to the production of new insurance and annuity business 
these costs include commissions  costs to issue and underwrite the policies and certain variable field office expenses 
the capitalized amounts are known as deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac 
our total dac  including the impact of unrealized investment gains and losses  amounted to billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   approximately of our total dac relates to our individual life and annuities segment  approximately relates to our international insurance segment and approximately relates to our closed block business 
if we were to experience a significant decrease in asset values or increase in lapse or surrender rates on policies for which we amortize dac based on estimated gross margins or gross profits  such as participating and variable life insurance  we would expect acceleration of the write off of dac for the affected blocks of policies 
additionally  for all policies on which we have outstanding dac  we would be required to evaluate whether this experience called into question our ability to recover all or a portion of the dac  and we would be required to write off some or all of the dac if we concluded that we could not recover it 
an accelerated write off of dac would negatively affect our reported earnings and level of capital under generally accepted accounting principles 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees we provide financial guarantees incidental to other transactions 
these credit related financial instruments have off balance sheet credit risk because only their origination fees  if any  and accruals for probable losses  if any  are recognized until the obligation under the instrument is fulfilled or expires 
these instruments can extend for several years and expirations are not concentrated in any single period 
we seek to control credit risk associated with these instruments by limiting credit  maintaining collateral where customary and appropriate and performing other monitoring procedures 

table of contents a number of guarantees provided by the company relate to real estate investments  in which the unconsolidated investor has borrowed funds  and we have guaranteed their obligation to their lender 
in some cases  the investor is an affiliate  and in other cases an unaffiliated investor purchases the real estate investment from us 
we provide these guarantees to assist them in obtaining financing for the transaction on more beneficial terms 
our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was million as of december  any payments that may become required of us under these guarantees would either first be reduced by proceeds received by the creditor on a sale of the assets  or would provide us with rights to obtain the assets 
as of december  no amounts were accrued as a result of our assessment that it is unlikely that payments will be required 
we are subject to other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements  including those related to business that have been sold 
some of these guarantees may extend far into the future and are subject to caps aggregating to million 
in other limited cases  the amount that can be claimed from us or the time in which these claims may be presented to us are not limited 
as of december   we have accrued liabilities of million associated with all other financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements  which does not include liabilities we retained associated with sold businesses 
other off balance sheet arrangements we do not have retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  or variable interests in unconsolidated entities or other similar transactions  arrangements or relationships that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support  that we believe are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or our access to or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we do not have relationships with any unconsolidated entities that are contractually limited to narrow activities that facilitate our transfer of or access to assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management  market risk and derivative instruments risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk  the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns on the underlying assets or liabilities 
we consider risk management an integral part of our core business 
market risk is the risk of change in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates or equity or commodity prices 
to varying degrees  the investment and trading activities supporting all of our products and services generate market risks 
the market risks incurred and our strategies for managing these risks vary by product 
with respect to non variable life insurance products  fixed rate annuities  the fixed rate options in our variable life insurance and annuity products  consumer banking products  and other finance businesses  we incur market risk primarily in the form of interest rate risk 
we manage this risk through asset liability management strategies that seek to match the interest rate sensitivity of the assets to that of the underlying liabilities 
our overall objective in these strategies is to limit the net change in value of assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements 
while it is more difficult to measure the interest sensitivity of our insurance liabilities than that of the related assets  to the extent that we can measure such sensitivities we believe that interest rate movements will generate asset value changes that substantially offset changes in the value of the liabilities relating to the underlying products 
for variable annuities and variable life insurance products  excluding the fixed rate options in these products  mutual funds and most separate accounts  our main exposure to the market is the risk that asset management fees decrease as a result of declines in assets under management due to changes in prices of securities 
we also run the risk that asset management fees calculated by reference to performance could be lower 
for variable annuity and variable life insurance products with minimum guaranteed death and other benefits  we also face the risk that declines in the value of underlying investments as a result of changes in prices of securities may increase our net exposure to these death and other benefits under these contracts 
see 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations result of operations for financial services businesses by segment insurance division individual life and annuities for payments made under the guaranteed minimum death benefit provision of certain individual annuity contracts  which we do not believe add significantly to our overall market risk 
we manage our exposure to equity price risk relating to our general account primarily by seeking to match the risk profile of equity investments against risk adjusted equity market benchmarks 
we measure benchmark risk levels in terms of price volatility in relation to the market in general 
the sources of our exposure to market risk can be divided into two categories  other than trading activities conducted primarily in our insurance  annuity and guaranteed products operations  and trading activities conducted primarily in our equity and futures operations  as well as  historically  in our former domestic retail securities brokerage business 
as part of our management of both other than trading and trading market risks  we use a variety of risk management tools and techniques 
these include sensitivity and value at risk var measures  position and other limits based on type of risk  and various hedging methods 
other than trading activities we hold the majority of our assets for other than trading activities in our segments that offer insurance  annuities and guaranteed products 
we incorporate asset liability management techniques and other risk management policies and limits into the process of investing our assets 
we use derivatives for hedging purposes in the asset liability management process 
insurance  annuities and guaranteed products asset liability management we seek to maintain interest rate and equity exposures within established ranges  which we periodically adjust based on market conditions and the design of related products sold to customers 
our risk managers establish investment risk limits for exposures to any issuer  geographic region  type of security or industry sector and oversee efforts to manage risk within policy constraints set by management and approved by the board of directors 
we use duration and convexity analyses to measure price sensitivity to interest rate changes 
duration measures the relative sensitivity of the fair value of a financial instrument to changes in interest rates 
convexity measures the rate of change of duration with respect to changes in interest rates 
we seek to manage our interest rate exposure by legal entity by matching the relative sensitivity of asset and liability values to interest rate changes  or controlling duration mismatch of assets and liabilities 
we have target duration mismatch constraints for each entity 
as of december  and  the difference between the pre tax duration of assets and the target duration of liabilities in our duration managed portfolios was within our constraint limits 
we consider risk based capital implications in our asset liability management strategies 
we also perform portfolio stress testing as part of our regulatory cash flow testing 
in this testing  we evaluate the impact of altering our interest sensitive assumptions under various moderately adverse interest rate environments 
these interest sensitive assumptions relate to the timing and amount of redemptions and prepayments of fixed income securities and lapses and surrenders of insurance products and the potential impact of any guaranteed minimum interest rates 
we evaluate any shortfalls that this cash flow testing reveals to determine if we need to increase statutory reserves or adjust portfolio management strategies 
market risk related to interest rates our other than trading assets that subject us to interest rate risk include primarily fixed maturity securities  commercial loans and policy loans 
in the aggregate  the carrying value of these assets represented of our consolidated assets  other than assets that we held in separate accounts  as of december  and as of december  with respect to other than trading liabilities  we are exposed to interest rate risk through policyholder account balances relating to interest sensitive life insurance  annuity and investment type contracts and through outstanding short term and long term debt 
we assess interest rate sensitivity for other than trading financial assets  financial liabilities and derivatives using hypothetical test scenarios that assume either upward or downward basis point parallel 
table of contents shifts in the yield curve from prevailing interest rates 
the following tables set forth the potential loss in fair value from a hypothetical basis point upward shift as of december  and  because this scenario results in the greatest net exposure to interest rate risk of the hypothetical scenarios tested at those dates 
while the test scenario is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect our expectations regarding future interest rates or the performance of fixed income markets  it is a near term  reasonably possible hypothetical change that illustrates the potential impact of such events 
these test scenarios do not measure the changes in value that could result from non parallel shifts in the yield curve  which we would expect to produce different changes in discount rates for different maturities 
as a result  the actual loss in fair value from a basis point change in interest rates could be different from that indicated by these calculations

as of december   our equity security units were included in guaranteed beneficial interest in trust holding solely debentures of parent 

table of contents the tables above do not include approximately billion of insurance reserve and deposit liabilities as of december  and billion as of december  we believe that the interest rate sensitivities of these insurance liabilities offset  in large measure  the interest rate risk of the financial assets set forth in these tables 
the million increase in the total estimated potential loss as of december  from december  resulted primarily from the increase in our portfolio of fixed maturities available for sale during the estimated changes in fair values of our financial assets shown above relate primarily to assets invested to support our insurance liabilities  but do not include assets associated with products for which investment risk is borne primarily by the contract holders rather than by us 
market risk related to equity prices we actively manage equity price risk against benchmarks in respective markets 
we benchmark our return on equity holdings against a blend of market indices  mainly the s p and russell  and we target price sensitivities that approximate those of the benchmark indices 
we estimate our equity price risk from a hypothetical decline in equity benchmark market levels and measure this risk in terms of the decline in fair market value of equity securities we hold 
using this methodology  our estimated equity price risk as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
our estimated equity price risk using this methodology as of december  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of equity securities we held at that date from billion to billion 
in calculating these amounts  we exclude equity securities related to products for which the investment risk is borne primarily by the contractholder rather than by us 
while these scenarios are for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect our expectations regarding future performance of equity markets or of our equity portfolio  they represent near term reasonably possible hypothetical changes that illustrate the potential impact of such events 
market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our general account and through our operations in foreign countries 
in our international life insurance business  we generally invest in assets denominated in the same currencies as our insurance liabilities  which mitigates our foreign currency exchange rate risk for these operations 
our exposure to foreign currency risk within the general account investment portfolios supporting our us insurance operations arises primarily from purchased investments that are denominated or payable in foreign currencies 
we generally hedge substantially all foreign currency denominated fixed income investments supporting our us operations into us dollars  using foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps  in order to mitigate the risk that the fair value of these investments fluctuates as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we generally do not hedge all of the foreign currency risk of our equity investments in unaffiliated foreign entities 
our operations in foreign countries create two additional sources of foreign currency risk 
first  we reflect the operating results of our foreign branches and subsidiaries in our financial statements based on the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
we hedge some of these foreign currency flows based on our overall risk management strategy and loss limits 
we generally hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations in japan and korea  of which our japanese insurance operations are the most significant  using foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps 
second  we translate our equity investment in foreign branches and subsidiaries into us dollars using the foreign currency exchange rate at the financial statement period end date 
we have chosen to partially hedge this exposure 
we actively manage foreign currency exchange rate risk within specified limits at the consolidated level using var analysis 
this statistical technique estimates  at a specified confidence level  the potential pre tax loss in portfolio market value that could occur over an assumed time horizon due to adverse market movements 
we calculate this using a variance covariance approach 

table of contents we calculate var estimates of exposure to loss from volatility in foreign currency exchange rates for one month time periods 
our estimated var as of december  for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from million to million 
our estimated var as of december  for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million  representing a hypothetical decline in fair market value of these foreign currency assets from million to million 
these calculations use historical price volatilities and correlation data at a confidence level 
we discuss limitations of var models below 
our estimated var for foreign exchange forward contracts and currency swaps used to hedge our anticipated exposure to adjusted operating income fluctuations resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to our international operations  measured at the confidence level and using a one month time horizon  was million as of december  and million as of december  our average monthly value at risk for foreign currency assets not hedged to us dollars from foreign currency exchange rate movements  measured at the confidence level over a one month time horizon  was million during and million during derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices  or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our derivative activities as of december  and under insurance statutes  our insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for certain income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments primarily to seek to reduce market risk from changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates  and to alter interest rate or foreign currency exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities 
in addition  derivatives are used in our futures operations for trading purposes 
trading activities we engage in trading activities primarily in connection with our equity and futures operations  as well as  historically  in our former domestic retail securities brokerage business 
we maintain trading inventories in various equity  foreign exchange instruments and commodities  primarily to facilitate transactions for our clients 
market risk affects the values of our trading inventories through fluctuations in absolute or relative interest rates  credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  securities and commodity prices 
we seek to use short security positions and forwards  futures  options and other derivatives to limit exposure to interest rate and other market risks 
we also trade derivative financial instruments that allow our clients to manage exposure to interest rate  currency and other market risks 
most of our derivative transactions involve exchange listed contracts and are short term in duration 
we act both as a broker  by selling exchange listed contracts  and as a dealer  by entering into futures and security transactions as a principal 
as a broker  we assume counterparty and credit risks that we seek to mitigate by using margin or other credit enhancements and by establishing trading limits and credit lines 
as a dealer  we are subject to market risk as well as counterparty and credit risk 
we manage the market risk associated with trading activities through hedging activities and formal policies  risk and position limits  counterparty and credit limits  daily position monitoring  and other forms of risk management 
value at risk var is one of the tools we use to monitor and manage our exposure to the market risk of our trading activities 
we calculate a var that encompasses our trading activities using a confidence level 
the var method incorporates the risk factors to which the market value of our trading activities is exposed  which consist of interest rates  including credit spreads  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  estimates of volatilities from historical data  the sensitivity of our trading activities to changes in those market factors and 
table of contents the correlations of those factors 
we regularly test our var model by comparing actual adverse results to those estimated by the var model with a confidence level over a one day time horizon 
the var for our trading activities expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value at the confidence level over a one day time horizon was million as of december  and million as of december  the average daily var for our trading activities  expressed in terms of adverse changes to fair value with a confidence level over a one day time horizon  was million during and million during the following table sets forth a breakdown of this var by risk component as follows as of december  average for as of december  average for in millions interest rate risk equity risk commodities risk total as of december  and  and during the years then ended  var from foreign currency exchange rate risk in our trading activities was immaterial 
limitations of var models although var models represent a recognized tool for risk management  they have inherent limitations  including reliance on historical data that may not be indicative of future market conditions or trading patterns 
accordingly  you should not view var models as a predictor of future results 
we may incur losses that could be materially in excess of the amounts indicated by the models on a particular trading day or over a period of time  and there have been instances when results have fallen outside the values generated by our var models 
a var model does not estimate the greatest possible loss 
we use these models together with other risk management tools  including stress testing 
the results of these models and analysis thereof are subject to the judgment of our risk management personnel
