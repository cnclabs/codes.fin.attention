item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nwa corp 
is a holding company whose principal indirect operating subsidiary is northwest 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nwa corp 
and all consolidated subsidiaries 
substantially all of the company s results of operations are attributable to its principal indirect operating subsidiary  northwest  which accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated operating revenues and expenses 
the company s results of operations also include other subsidiaries  of which mlt and pinnacle airlines have been the most significant 
the following discussion pertains primarily to northwest and  where indicated  mlt and pinnacle airlines 
the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million in diluted earnings per share were in compared with a loss per share of in operating loss was million in compared with an operating loss of million in passenger revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million compared to  continuing their three year trend of decline 
full year results included million of net unusual pre tax gains 
operating expenses included million of unusual items related to employee severance  a pension curtailment charge and aircraft write downs 
net unusual non operating gains totaling million were comprised of a million gain from the initial public offering of of the company s investment in pinnacle airlines corp  million received under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act as reimbursement for security fees previously paid to the tsa  a million gain from the sale of the company s investment in worldspan  a million net gain related to the acquisition of the corporation which held the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred security  a million gain from the sale of its investment in hotwire 
com hotwire  an million gain from the sale of a portion of its investment in orbitz and a million loss on the company s debt exchange 
full year results included million in unusual pre tax charges  principally comprised of million attributable to the accelerated retirement of certain boeing and dc aircraft  million of costs associated with the closure of several facilities  million related to employee benefit costs and additional asset write downs  and a million partial write down of the company s receivable from the us government related to the grant under the airline stabilization act 
in addition  the effective tax rate reflected a million provision for tax credits the company expected to expire unused 
northwest and the current status of the airline industry the airline industry is intensely competitive 
northwest s competitors include other major domestic airlines as well as foreign  regional and new entrant airlines  some of which have more financial resources or lower cost structures than northwest 
in most markets that northwest serves  it competes with at least one of these carriers 
our revenues are sensitive to numerous factors  and the actions of other carriers in the areas of pricing  scheduling and promotions can have a substantial adverse impact on overall industry revenues 
such factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses  as airlines under financial stress  or in bankruptcy  may institute pricing structures intended to achieve near term survival rather than long term viability 
since  the us airline industry overall has suffered a substantial reduction in revenues  both on an absolute basis and relative to historical trends 
the company s annual operating revenue has declined in each of the last three years and its operating revenue was over billion less than it was in as a result  the company has incurred significant operating losses  and absent unusual items  its pre tax losses over that period have totaled nearly billion 
the company does not anticipate that the revenue environment will materially improve in due to the discretionary nature of business and personal travel spending  us airline revenues are heavily influenced by the strength of the us economy  other regional world economies and corporate profitability 
the revenue decline has been due in part to the us economic cycle 
however  permanent structural differences in the industry revenue environment have also taken place 
these differences are the result of a number of factors 
the rapid growth of low cost airlines has had a profound impact on industry revenues 
using the advantage of low unit costs  driven in large part by lower labor costs  these carriers are able to operate profitably while offering substantially lower fares 
by targeting such fares at business passengers in particular  these carriers are shifting demand away from the larger  more established airlines 
these low cost carriers now transport more than of all domestic us passengers  compared to less than a decade ago 
they now compete for  and thus influence industry pricing on  approximately of all domestic us passenger ticket sales  versus less than a decade ago 
moreover  as a result of their better financial performance  low cost carriers have the resources necessary to continue to increase their market share 
industry revenue could be reduced substantially in the event one or more large network carriers decides it is a better long term strategy to adopt a broad pricing structure similar to those employed by low cost carriers rather than give up additional market share 
internet travel web sites have driven significant distribution cost savings for airlines  but have also allowed consumers to become more efficient at finding lower fare alternatives than in the past by providing them with more powerful pricing information 
the increased price consciousness of both business and leisure travelers  as well as the growth in new distribution channels  has further motivated airlines to price aggressively to gain fare and market share advantages 
these factors will increase over time as internet ticket sales increase 
airlines are among the most heavily taxed of all us companies 
taxes and fees can add up to approximately of what a passenger pays for an average roundtrip domestic airline ticket  a percentage even greater than that for alcohol and tobacco products 
these taxes and fees have grown significantly in the past decade 
the company believes that every dollar of tax or fee increase imposed on airline passengers roughly translates into a dollar of reduced airline revenue 
the attacks of september  materially impacted air travel and  with concerns about further terrorist attacks unlikely to abate any time soon  continue to have a negative effect on travel demand 
additionally  security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks have increased the inconvenience of flying  both in reality and in perception  and thus have further reduced demand 
global events further exacerbated the decline in airline industry revenue in the war in iraq and its aftermath and the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars have materially affected airline bookings and continue to negatively impact air travel  particularly on international routes 
another outbreak of sars or other influenza type illness  if it were to persist for an extended period  could materially affect the airline industry by reducing revenues and impacting travel behavior  especially on routes to and from certain asian destinations 
in response to the industry environment  the company has taken aggressive steps to mitigate the impact on its results of operations and financial condition resulting from these adverse trends 
in the past two years  these steps have included a significant decrease in scheduled capacity on an available seat mile basis  a reduction in work force of over  full time equivalent positions  deferral of certain aircraft orders  closure of maintenance facilities  flight crew bases  reservations and sales facilities and deferrals and cancellations of discretionary and other non operationally critical spending 
in all  eight rounds of cost savings have been initiated since the us economy began weakening in early  resulting in cost reductions totaling billion 
despite these and other significant steps to reduce costs  additional measures will be necessary in response to the fundamentally changed industry revenue environment 
wages  salaries and benefits made up of the company s operating expenses and will be the critical component of future cost reduction initiatives 
the company is in discussions with its labor unions in an effort to align wages  benefits and work rules with the new revenue environment and to remain competitive with airlines that have achieved permanent labor cost reductions through bankruptcy proceedings united airlines  us airways or the threat of bankruptcy american airlines 
the company cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations at this time 
results of operations compared to operating revenues 
operating revenues increased million 
system passenger revenues decreased million  excluding pinnacle airlines 
the decrease in system passenger revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in traffic partially offset by a increase in yields

yield passenger rasm domestic passenger revenues increased primarily due to slight improvements in yields  partially offset by a small decline in traffic 
pacific passenger revenues decreased substantially due to lower traffic 
despite a reduction in capacity  largely intended to match lower demand as a result of the iraq war and the sars epidemic  the pacific load factor was down percentage points 
atlantic passenger revenues decreased due to a significant reduction in traffic caused by the iraq war  some of which was offset by higher yields 
cargo revenues increased million to million due to a increase in yield  partially offset by a decline in cargo ton miles 
cargo revenues consist of freight and mail carried on passenger aircraft and the company s boeing f dedicated freighters 
freight revenue increased million while mail revenue decreased million 
in the last half of  the company decided to stop carrying us domestic mail as lower volumes and yields  partially due to restrictions imposed by the us government following september   caused this business to become unprofitable 
other revenues  the principal components of which are mlt  other transportation fees and charter revenues  increased million 
this increase was primarily due to increased revenues from craf and other charter activities  frequent flyer partnership revenue  ticketing and handling fees  klm joint venture settlements  the nba transportation program and support services revenue

b 
aircraft fuel and taxes were higher due to a increase in the average fuel cost per gallon to cents  net of hedging transactions  partially offset by fewer fuel gallons consumed as a result of reduced capacity and the use of more fuel efficient aircraft 
fuel hedge transactions reduced fuel costs by million in and million in c 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million  due primarily to the elimination of north american base travel agency commissions  which began to take effect near the end of the second quarter of  lower passenger volumes and lower advertising expenses

h 
other expenses which include mlt operating expenses  outside services  insurance  passenger food  personnel expenses  communication expenses and supplies decreased principally due to lower northwest passenger volumes  lower passenger liability insurance and lower mlt operating expenses 
other income and expense 
other non operating income increased by million  primarily due to several unusual items a million gain from the sale of the company s investment in pinnacle airlines corp  million received under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act as reimbursement for security fees previously paid to the tsa  a million gain from the sale of the company s investment in worldspan  a million gain related to a write down of the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred security  accompanied by an impairment charge of million related to the property securing this obligation  a million gain from the sale of the company s investment in hotwire  and an million gain from the sale of a portion of the company s investment in orbitz 
the company also generated a higher return on short term investments  which partially offset higher interest expense related to increased debt levels 
tax expense benefit 
during  the company recognized a million tax benefit related to losses recorded in the first quarter that fully offset its remaining million net deferred tax liability 
given recent loss experience  current accounting rules do not allow the company s balance sheet to reflect a net deferred tax asset 
therefore  a valuation allowance is provided against tax benefits  principally for net operating losses in excess of its previously remaining deferred tax liability

cargo revenues increased million to million due to a increase in cargo ton miles partially offset by a decline in revenue per ton mile 
cargo revenues consist of freight and mail carried on passenger aircraft and the company s f dedicated freighters 
freight revenue increased million  including approximately million in the fourth quarter resulting from the west coast dockworkers lockout 
however  this was partially offset by a million decrease in mail revenue  due largely to lower volumes resulting from us government restrictions imposed following september  on the transportation of packages larger than ounces on passenger aircraft 
such restrictions were responsible  in part  for northwest ultimately deciding in the second half of to discontinue us domestic mail carriage as lower volumes and yields caused this business to become unprofitable 
other revenues  the principal components of which are mlt  other transportation fees and charter revenues  decreased million

other income and expense 
other non operating income decreased by million  primarily due to million recognized in under the airline stabilization act  higher interest expense related to increased debt levels  and lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge to write down a portion of a receivable from the us government to reflect the final amount received in january under the airline stabilization act 
interest expense increased million primarily due to the full year borrowings under the company s revolving credit facilities and additional new financings 
higher earnings from affiliates during were partially offset by a million gain from the sale of the company s remaining shares of continental recorded in tax expense benefit 
the tax benefit recorded in includes a provision of million for tax credits that are expected to expire unused 
the company s net deferred tax liability declined from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the increase in deferred tax assets relating to the company s pension plans and the company s losses 
given the company s recent loss experience  current accounting rules do not allow its balance sheet to reflect a net tax asset position 
as a result  when losses after december  generated deferred tax assets that fully offset the company s then existing deferred tax liabilities  no tax benefit could be recognized with respect to further losses 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note income taxes  for additional discussion of the company s tax accounts 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of billion 
this amount included million of restricted short term investments  resulting in total unrestricted liquidity of billion 
as discussed later  the company s secured credit facilities were fully drawn as of december  and had approximately million available as of december  cash flows 
liquidity increased by million as of december   due primarily to million security fee reimbursements received from the us government under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act  a million income tax refund  cash proceeds of million from the sale of worldspan and the issuances of million and million of senior convertible notes  partially offset by million in cash contributions to the pension plans  capital expenditures  net of financings  and other investing and financing activities 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to cash used by operating activities of million in this increase of million was largely due to the million of emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act funds received in may  net income tax receipts million higher in than and the payment in january of million of aviation taxes originally due between september  and january  the company operates  like its competitors  with negative working capital  which totaled million at december  this negative working capital position is primarily attributable to the company s billion air traffic liability  largely representing cash received from tickets that customers have not yet used 
investing activities 
investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of short term investments  aircraft capital expenditures and other related costs 
other related costs include engine purchases  costs to commission aircraft before entering revenue service  deposits on ordered aircraft  facility improvements and ground equipment purchases

in addition to the financed aircraft discussed above  the company also took delivery of one airbus a  one airbus a  one airbus a  three boeing aircraft and bombardier crj regional jets during the twelve months ended december  the airbus a  a and a aircraft and the three boeing aircraft were acquired through non cash transactions with manufacturers 
the bombardier crj aircraft were acquired and financed with long term operating leases and subleased to pinnacle airlines 
on december   northwest completed an offer to exchange outstanding unsecured notes old notes due in  and  with interest rates ranging from to  for new class d pass through trust certificates class d certificates representing a fractional undivided interest in the assets of a pass through trust 
the trust s assets consist of interests in million principal amount of notes primarily secured by aircraft financed under five series of northwest pass through certificates previously issued 
holders tendered approximately million of old notes for million of class d certificates 
the exchange was accounted for as an extinguishment of debt under generally accepted accounting principles  with the company recording an associated loss because the cash flows of the new debt instrument are greater than percent of the original instruments remaining cash flows 
the loss recognized in the consolidated statements of operations due to this exchange offer approximated million

nwa corp 
may elect to pay the repurchase price in cash or in shares of common stock  or a combination of both  subject to certain conditions 
should holders elect to require nwa corp

plans to use the net proceeds from the offerings for working capital and general corporate purposes 
financing activities in consisted primarily of the issuance of million of unsecured notes due in  the payment of debt and capital lease obligations  and the financing of i airbus a  one boeing  two airbus a and three boeing aircraft with escrowed funds from offerings of pass through trust certificates completed in  ii two boeing aircraft with escrowed funds from an offering of pass through trust certificates completed in  iii three boeing  two boeing and six airbus a aircraft with long term bank debt  iv one boeing aircraft under a sale and leaseback  and the refinancing of three boeing aircraft purchased off capital lease 
in august  northwest completed an offering of million of pass through trust certificates to finance or refinance the acquisition of new airbus a  six new boeing and three new airbus a aircraft that were delivered between october and december the pre funded portion of cash proceeds from the offerings of certificates were invested and held in escrow with a depositary bank 
such funds were not assets or direct obligations of  or guaranteed by  northwest and are therefore not included in the consolidated financial statements 
as aircraft were delivered or refinanced  northwest utilized the cash proceeds to finance the acquisition of these aircraft as secured debt financing for ownership 
as of december   there were no unused offering proceeds held in escrow 
financing activities in consisted primarily of the company s borrowing in march and subsequent repayment in may of billion under its revolving credit facilities  the borrowing on september   of billion under its revolving credit facilities  of which million was repaid in october as scheduled  the issuance of million of unsecured notes due  million received under airport facility revenue bonds and payment of debt and capital lease obligations 
financing activities also included the receipt of million in financing for i airbus a aircraft  seven of which were financed with funds from pass through trust certificates and six with long term bank debt  ii five boeing aircraft financed with long term bank debt  and iii four airbus a aircraft  three of which were financed with funds from pass through trust certificates and one with long term bank debt 
in june  the company completed an offering of million of pass through certificates at a blended fixed coupon rate of 
proceeds from sales of the certificates were used to finance the acquisition of aircraft consisting of nine new airbus a aircraft  three new boeing aircraft and two new boeing aircraft delivered between march and december in july  the company completed an offering of million of european pass through certificates due in at a blended floating rate of three month london interbank offered rate libor plus as of december  to finance the acquisition of nine new airbus a aircraft and five new airbus a aircraft delivered between november and july contractual obligations

the amount due in includes million of principal outstanding on the company s bank revolving credit facilities 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note long term debt and short term borrowings  for additional information related to interest rates on these amounts 
amounts represent principal payments only 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note leases  for information related to interest on these amounts 
amounts represent minimum lease payments with initial or remaining terms of more than one year and exclude related sublease rental income 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note leases  for information related to these amounts 
amounts represent contractual commitments for firm order aircraft only and are net of previously paid purchase deposits 
the company has firm financing commitments in place for all of the firm order aircraft from manufacturers 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note commitments  for a discussion of these purchase commitments 
amounts represent non cancelable commitments to purchase goods and services  including such items as software communications and information technology support 
in addition to the contractual cash obligations and commitments included in the table above  the company will in the ordinary course spend significant amounts of cash to operate its business 
for example  the company will pay wages as required under its various collective bargaining agreements and will be obligated to make contributions to the pension plans benefiting its employees as discussed below  the company will purchase capacity from its regional airline affiliates in return for which northwest generally retains all revenues from tickets sold in respect of that purchased capacity  and the company will pay  among other items  credit card processing fees  computer reservation system fees and outside services related to engine and airframe maintenance 
while these and other expenditures may be covered by legally binding agreements  the actual payment amounts will depend on volume and other factors that cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty  and accordingly they are not included in the table 
purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the table 
any amounts for which the company is liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the above table also excludes million in respect of the series c preferred stock 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note redeemable preferred and common stock  for additional discussion of the company s obligations related to the series c preferred stock 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the securities and exchange commission sec requires registrants to disclose off balance sheet arrangements 
as defined by the sec  an off balance sheet arrangement includes any contractual obligation  agreement or transaction arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  has a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  has an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or has any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the company 
the company has examined its contractual obligation structures potentially impacted by this disclosure requirement and has concluded that no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories exist that the company believes may have a material current or future effect on its financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the company has obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities 
the company has adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
as of july  for certain variable interests based on the current guidance provided by the fasb 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note summary of significant accounting policies  for additional discussion of these variable interest arrangements 
pension funding obligations 
the company also has noncontributory pension plans covering its pilots  other contract employees and salaried employees 
funding obligations under these plans are governed by erisa 
as of december   the company s pension plans were underfunded by billion  as calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
absent asset returns exceeding plan assumptions  the company will have to satisfy the underfunded amounts of its plans through cash contributions over time 
the timing and amount of funding requirements depend upon a number of factors  including interest rates  asset returns  potential changes in pension legislation  the company s decision to make voluntary prepayments  applications for and receipt of waivers to reschedule contributions and changes to pension plan benefits 
among other effects  those factors may result in contributions for a particular plan year being made across multiple calendar years 
on november   the company submitted an application to the irs for authorization to reschedule  over a five year period beginning in april  the million in plan year contributions under the pension plans for contract and salaried employees 
in  the irs approved the application  subject to the company s satisfaction of certain conditions imposed by the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc  which the company satisfied by granting the plans liens on certain assets of the company certain domestic slots  international routes  aircraft and engines 
as a result  the value of the company s remaining unencumbered assets is not material 
in november  the company submitted an application to the dol to permit it to contribute common stock of pinnacle airlines corp 
to the pension plans in lieu of making certain required contributions in cash 
in  the dol granted the company s application for a prohibited transaction exemption 
in  pursuant to the exemption  the company contributed approximately million shares  or  of pinnacle airlines corp 
common stock to the contract and salaried plans to satisfy approximately million scheduled funding requirements for the plan year 
the company also contributed million in cash to satisfy its remaining plan year scheduled funding requirements 
pursuant to an agreement with alpa  the company also made a voluntary contribution of million to the pilots pension plan  consisting of approximately million shares  or  of pinnacle airlines corp 
common stock 
this voluntary contribution eliminated further erisa required contributions to the pilots plan until on november  the pinnacles airlines corp 
shares held by the plans were sold in an ipo 
the offering generated million in proceeds  requiring the company to contribute an additional million to the plans to make up the difference between the original valuations of the shares at the time of their contribution and the net ipo proceeds 
the company s calendar year cash pension contributions are dependent on several factors 
on december   the company asked the irs for permission to reschedule some of its plan year pension contributions  which includes amounts due in both and  for the contract and salaried employees pension plans 
separately  the us congress has under consideration certain legislative relief that could reduce contributions by increasing the discount rate used to determine funding  changing the current requirements for deficit reduction contributions  or both 
prior legislation increased the discount rate used by companies to determine funding requirements for the past two years 
on that basis  expected contributions to the company s qualified pension plans in approximates million 
however  approval of the company s application to reschedule contributions and or additional legislative relief could reduce its pension funding requirements for these plans to between million and million for the year 
should the company s request to reschedule contributions not be approved by the irs and congress provides no legislative relief  its qualified plan funding obligations in calendar year would approximate million 
credit ratings 
at december   the company s standard poor s corporate credit rating and its senior unsecured credit rating were b and b  respectively  its moody s investor services senior implied rating and senior unsecured rating were b and caa  respectively  and its fitch ratings senior unsecured credit rating was b 
the lowering of the company s credit ratings could make it more difficult to issue debt  including the ability to utilize certain financing commitments related to future aircraft deliveries  to renew outstanding letters of credit that back certain obligations and to obtain financial instruments used in its fuel and currency hedging 
it could also increase the cost of these transactions 
for information regarding the impact from the lowering of the credit rating on the company s secured credit facility on april   see the related discussion below as well as item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note long term debt and short term borrowings 
secured credit facilities 
the company s secured credit facilities at december   consisted of a million revolving credit facility million of which has been utilized to establish letters of credit available until october  and a million day revolving credit facility available until october and renewable annually at the option of the lenders  however  to the extent any portion of the million facility is not renewed for an additional day period  the company may borrow up to the entire non renewed portion of the facility and such borrowings would then mature in october borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by the company s pacific route system and certain aircraft 
on march   standard poor s downgraded the rating on the company s secured credit facilities to b from bb 
on april   moody s downgraded the rating on the company s secured credit facilities to b from ba with the change in credit rating and the measurement of certain collateral tests required under the company s credit facilities  the interest rate applicable to borrowings under these secured credit facilities increased by basis points 
borrowings under both revolving credit facilities bear interest at a variable rate equal to the three month libor plus at january  
the credit agreement includes a covenant that requires the company  beginning with the three month period ending june   to maintain at least a one to one ratio of earnings adjusted to exclude the effects of interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and aircraft rents to fixed charges comprising interest expense and aircraft rents 
if the company fails to meet this fixed charges coverage ratio  borrowings under the credit facility could be accelerated by the banks 
while the company currently believes that it will satisfy this requirement  compliance with the covenant depends upon many factors that could impact future revenues and expenses  some of which are beyond the company s control 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note long term debt and short term borrowings  for additional discussion of these credit facilities 
unsecured debt issued in january in january  northwest completed an offering of million of unsecured notes due the notes have a coupon rate of  payable semi annually in cash on february and august of each year  beginning on august   and are not redeemable prior to maturity 
each note was issued at a price of per  principal amount  resulting in a yield to maturity of 
proceeds from the sale of the notes will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the notes are guaranteed by nwa corp 
shelf registration statement 
as of december   the company had an effective shelf registration statement for the issuance of billion of unsecured debt and pass through certificates 
the million unsecured debt issuance in january reduced this amount to billion 
receivables financings 
in january  through nwa funding llc  the company fully repaid million outstanding under a receivables purchase agreement 
such repayment was required upon the occurrence of certain events  including exceeding a threshold of passenger refunds as a percentage of sales and the lowering of the company s unsecured credit rating  both of which occurred following the events of september  in june  a second receivables purchase agreement was executed by northwest  nwa funding ii  llc nwfii  a wholly owned  non consolidated subsidiary of the company  and third party purchasers purchasers 
the agreement was a day  million maximum revolving receivables purchase facility  renewable annually for five years at the option of the purchasers  that allowed nwfii to sell variable undivided interests in accounts receivable acquired from northwest to the purchasers 
nwfii paid a yield to the purchasers equal to the rate on a f commercial paper plus a program fee 
the receivables purchase agreement terminated in july the purchasers then collected million on outstanding receivables 
due to seasonal fluctuations in accounts receivable sold under the agreement  the company estimates that termination of the program reduced its cash balance at december  by approximately million 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially reflect materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note summary of significant accounting policies  for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies 
the company s management discussed the development of the estimates and disclosures related to each of these matters with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
asset valuation and impairments 
the company evaluates long lived assets for potential impairments in compliance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company records impairment losses on long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amounts 
in determining the need to record impairment charges  the company is required to make certain estimates regarding such things as the current fair market value of the assets and future net cash flows to be generated by the assets 
the current fair market value is determined by independent appraisal  and the future net cash flows are based on assumptions such as asset utilization  expected remaining useful lives  future market trends and projected salvage values 
impairment charges are recorded in depreciation and amortization expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations 
if there are subsequent changes in these estimates  or if actual results differ from these estimates  such changes could impact the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the company recorded an aircraft impairment of million as additional depreciation expense  primarily for boeing aircraft used in charter operations 
in december  the company recorded an impairment charge of million as other expense  which related to foreign real property that then secured certain debt obligations of the company 
in december  the company revised its fleet plan  accelerating the retirement of dc and nine boeing aircraft by an average of five and six years  respectively 
the company recorded impairment charges of million associated with these aircraft  engines and related inventory as a result of the retirement acceleration 
the company s operating results were also impacted by an estimated million of additional depreciation expense related to these aircraft  reflecting the combined effect of the reduced average lives  a decrease in net book values and lower salvage values 
if the current fair market values and salvage values of the impaired aircraft were decreased by  the aircraft impairment charge would have increased by million and the depreciation expense would have decreased by million 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note summary of significant accounting policies  for additional discussion of impairment of long lived assets 
pension liability and expense 
the company has several noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all of its employees 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis that includes estimates relating to expected return on plan assets  discount rate and employee compensation 
benefits associated with these plans are based primarily on years of service and  in some cases  employee compensation 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note pension and other postretirement health care benefits  for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension liability and expense 
a significant element in determining the company s pension expense is the expected return on plan assets  which is based in part on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred and  under certain circumstances  amortized over future years of service 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
at december   the company changed its assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to  which remained in place as of december  in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  the company examines projected returns by asset category with its pension investment advisors 
projected returns are based primarily on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices  with minor adjustments to account for the value of active management the funds have provided historically 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target asset allocation of us equities  international equities  long duration fixed income securities  private market securities and high yield fixed income securities 
this target asset allocation yields an expected weighted average return slightly in excess of on an annual basis 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note pension and other postretirement health care benefits  for further information on the company s investment policy for its defined benefit plans and actual investment mix by asset category as of december  the actual asset allocation is reviewed regularly and is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation 
the plan assets earned a rate of return substantially less than in each of  and  but exceeded that rate in  earning 
for the nine year period in which the current asset allocation policy has been in place  the plan assets have generated annualized returns of 
depending on future rates of return  the company s average long term historical rate of return may decline and could  in turn  cause the expected return on plan assets to be adjusted downward 
if such adjustments become necessary  future pension expense would increase 
plan assets for the company s pension plans are managed by external investment management organizations 
these advisors are prohibited by the investment policies of the plan from investing in company securities  other than as part of a market index fund that could have a diminutive proportion of such securities 
the company also determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plans that hold high  investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies 
by applying this methodology  the company determined a discount rate of to be appropriate at december   which is a reduction of from the rate used at december  for the year ended december   accounting for the changes related to the company s pension plans resulted in a net increase to accumulated other comprehensive income of million on a pre tax basis 
the positive impact on accumulated other comprehensive income was principally due to a increase in the fair value of the plan assets  offset by a rise in benefit obligations that was principally driven by the decrease in the discount rate to 
holding all other factors constant  a change in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by would have changed accumulated other comprehensive income by million on a pre tax basis 
for pension plans sponsored by the company in which benefits depend  in part  on the future level of wages  the projected rate of future compensation increases is an important assumption that affects the amount of periodic pension expense recognized 
the company s expectations regarding future wage increases are based on several factors  including historical trends  contractual obligations under collective bargaining agreements  and prevailing market forces 
as of december   the weighted average rate of future compensation increases assumed for the affected plans was annually  which compares with and at december  and  respectively 
these changes are reflective of significant downward wage pressures in the us airline industry resulting from the continued expansion of low cost carriers  which derive a large part of their cost advantage from lower labor rates  and significant wage savings achieved at several of the company s major competitors during the past year 
for the year ended december   the company recognized consolidated pre tax pension expense of million  up from million in the amount for included million related to a curtailment charge in the contract plan due to workforce reductions 
pension expense is expected to approximate million in holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million in holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million in holding all other factors constant  reducing the rate of future wage increases from to will decrease pension expense by approximately million 
revenue recognition 
passenger ticket proceeds are recorded in the air traffic liability account at the time of sale and represent an obligation of the company to provide air travel in the future 
revenue is recognized  and the air traffic liability is reduced  as passengers use these tickets for transportation 
the company performs monthly evaluations of this estimated liability and recognizes any adjustments in passenger revenues for that period 
these adjustments relate primarily to ticket usage patterns  refunds  exchanges  inter airline transactions  and other travel obligations for which final settlement occurs in periods subsequent to the sale of the related tickets at amounts other than the original sales price 
while these factors generally follow predictable patterns that provide a reliable basis for estimating the air traffic liability  and the company uses historical trends and averages in its estimates  significant changes in business conditions and or passenger behavior that affect these estimates could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements 
frequent flyer accounting 
the company utilizes a number of estimates in accounting for its worldperks frequent flyer program 
the company accounts for the frequent flyer program obligations by recording a liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards expected to be redeemed 
customers are expected to redeem their mileage  and a liability is recorded  when their accounts accumulate the minimum number of miles needed to obtain one flight award 
additional assumptions are made  based on past general customer behavior  regarding the likelihood of customers using the miles for first class upgrades or other premiums instead of flight awards  as well as the likelihood of customers never redeeming the miles 
estimated incremental costs are based on the system average cost per passenger for food and beverage  fuel  insurance  security  miscellaneous claims and worldperks distribution and administration expenses 
if the average incremental cost of outstanding awards were increased or decreased by  the liability for the estimated incremental cost of flight awards expected to be redeemed would change by million 
the number of estimated travel awards outstanding at december   and was approximately   and  respectively 
the estimated liability excludes accounts that have never attained the minimum travel award level  awards that are expected to be redeemed for upgrades  and the proportion not expected to be redeemed at all  but includes an estimate for partially earned awards on accounts that previously earned an award 
northwest recorded a liability for these estimated awards of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the number of travel awards used for travel on northwest during the years ended december   and was approximately   and  respectively 
these awards represented an estimated  and of northwest s total rpms for each such year  respectively 
northwest believes displacement of revenue passengers is minimal based on the low ratio of worldperks award usage to revenue passenger miles and the company s ability to manage frequent flyer inventory through seat allocations 
in june  the minimum program award miles was changed from  to  miles  which is primarily responsible for the decline in the number of estimated awards outstanding and the recorded liability since the company defers a portion of the revenue from the sale of mileage credits to participating partners such as credit card issuers  hotels  long distance companies  car rental firms and other non airline partners 
the deferred revenue is recognized over the period in which the credits are expected to be redeemed for travel 
the portion of revenue that is recognized at the time of sale represents amounts in excess of the fair value of the tickets to be redeemed 
intangible assets 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that companies test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis rather than amortize such assets 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of january   and as a result no longer amortizes its indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its impairment test of goodwill and found the fair value to be in excess of the carrying value 
during the first quarter of  an independent third party appraisal was conducted for the company s annual impairment test of its international routes and found the fair value to be in excess of the carrying value 
the company s indefinite lived intangible asset derives from the us japan bilateral aviation agreement  which establishes rights to carry traffic between japan and the us  and extensive fifth freedom rights between japan and india  the south pacific and other asian destinations 
fifth freedom rights allow northwest to operate service from any gateway in japan to points beyond japan and carry japanese originating passengers 
these rights have no termination date  and the company has the supporting infrastructure airport gates  slots and terminal facility leases in place to operate air service to japan and beyond from its us hub airports indefinitely 
governmental policy and bilateral agreements between nations regulate international operating route authorities and alliances 
the company s carrying value of international route authorities was million at december  should any changes occur in policies  agreements  infrastructure or economic feasibility of air service to japan  the company will assess this asset for impairment and re evaluate the economic life of these international routes 
if the life is then determined to be finite  the company would begin amortizing the asset 
stock based compensation 
as of december   the company has stock option plans for officers and key employees of the company 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note stock options  for additional discussion of stock options 
the company historically accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
prior to january   no stock based employee compensation expense related to options were reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  as all options granted in or before have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for companies that voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
it also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and quarterly financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value method of recording stock based employee compensation prescribed by sfas no 
and accounts for this change in accounting principle using the prospective method as described by sfas no 
all employee stock option grants made on or after january  are recorded as compensation expense over the vesting period based on the fair value at the date the stock based compensation is granted 
the company also adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
for the year ended december   and the related disclosures are included in item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note stock options 
on january   the company completed an option exchange program  pursuant to which officers of the company were able to exchange their stock options at a ratio of two old options for one newly issued option 
the new options have a strike price of  the average of the high and low price of the company s common stock on the award date of january  the compensation expense related to these new options will be amortized over a four year vesting period using the fair value method of recording stock based employee compensation 
certain other management employees of the company were able to exchange their stock options for phantom units instruments settled in cash at the time of vesting at a ratio of three old options for one phantom unit 
the compensation expense related to these phantom units will be recognized over the four year vesting period  adjusted for the current period stock price  consistent with how phantom units have been expensed in the past 
on june   the company completed an option exchange program for its pilots holding stock options or stock appreciation rights sars granted pursuant to the pilots stock option plan 
this exchange program was adopted as part of a letter of agreement with alpa to obtain approval of the delta codeshare agreement from alpa 
pilot participants were able to exchange all of their outstanding stock options or sars for a designated number of replacement options or replacement sars  respectively 
eligible participants were able to exchange their existing stock options and sars at a ratio of two shares subject to an old award for one share subject to a newly issued award of the same type although certain outstanding sars were exchanged only for newly issued options 
the exercise price of the new awards is the average of the high and low sales prices of the company s common stock on the award date of july   or per share 
compensation expense related to these new options will be amortized over a four year vesting period using the fair value method of recording stock based compensation 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock options  for additional discussion of these stock option exchange programs 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this revision requires disclosures in addition to those in the original statement about the assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
the company has adopted the provisions of the revised sfas no 
as of december   and has included the required disclosures in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of was passed by congress and signed into law on december  the act establishes a voluntary prescription drug benefit for eligible participants beginning january  the act also provides for the government to pay a special subsidy equal to of a retiree s covered prescription drug expenses between and  adjusted annually for the percentage increase in medicare per capita prescription drug costs to employers who sponsor retiree prescription drug plans 
in accordance with fasb staff position  the company has elected to defer including the effects of the act in any measures of accumulated postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic postretirement benefit costs reflected in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and that guidance  when issued  could require the company to change previously reported information 
the company estimates that the act will not have a significant impact on postretirement liabilities and benefit costs 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires companies to determine whether a financing or other arrangement constitutes a variable interest entity 
if a company concludes that such an arrangement is a variable interest entity  the company must then evaluate whether it is the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is required to consolidate the entity for financial statement purposes 
variable interest entities are those that have insufficient equity investment at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated support or lack essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest including  among others  the obligation to absorb expected losses  or the right to receive expected residual returns  of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the enterprise that is obligated to absorb the expected losses or has a right to receive the expected residual returns 
fin was effective immediately for variable interest entities created  or in which the company obtains an interest  after january  for all variable interest entities created on or before january   the fasb delayed the initial effective date of the provisions until the quarter ending december   but encouraged early adoption 
the company has adopted the provisions of fin as of july  for all variable interests based on then existing guidance provided by the fasb 
the company formerly consolidated a financing entity as described in note mandatorily redeemable security that issued a preferred security previously classified on the company s consolidated financial statements as mandatorily redeemable preferred security of subsidiary which holds solely non recourse obligation of company mrps 
this subsidiary is a variable interest entity under the provisions of fin  but the company is not the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  as of july   the company no longer consolidated the subsidiary but an amount equal to the mrps million as of december   representing the company s non recourse obligation to the subsidiary  was recorded as mandatorily redeemable security in the liability section of the company s consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of the company purchasing the entity that holds the mrps during the december quarter  the mrps is no longer a liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company has examined its other financing arrangements potentially impacted by the provisions of fin and has concluded that no additional arrangements of a material nature require consolidation 
in its report on form q for the quarter ended june   the company described its preliminary conclusions regarding four aircraft leases that have historically been accounted for as operating leases for book purposes but as a loan for tax purposes 
based on an examination of the provisions of fin at that time  the company reported that it would begin accounting for these leases as capital leases for book purposes and record a cumulative effect charge associated with this change in the quarter ending september  subsequent interpretive guidance by the fasb resulted in a determination by the company that the lessor is not a variable interest entity under the provisions of fin therefore  the company will not consolidate these aircraft leases and will continue to account for them as operating leases 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments and specifies that some financing arrangements with characteristics of both liabilities and equity must be classified as liabilities 
among the requirements of sfas is that all mandatorily redeemable securities be classified as liabilities 
in the absence of applying fin  this would have resulted in the company reclassifying the mandatorily redeemable security described above to a liability 
given the effects of fin  however  the equivalent result already applied 
the company adopted sfas on july  and anticipates that this standard will have no other material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with disposal or exit activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than when an entity commits to an exit plan 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  this new statement changed the timing of liability and expense recognition related to exit or disposal activities  but not the ultimate amount of such expenses 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and to provide additional disclosures about each guarantee  or each group of similar guarantees 
the company adopted the disclosure provisions of fin as of december   and adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees issued or modified after december  see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note contingencies  for the company s disclosures concerning its guarantor obligations

alliances 
northwest has strengthened its network through alliance partnerships 
long term alliances are the most effective way for northwest to enter markets that it would not be able to serve alone 
alliance relationships can include codesharing  reciprocal frequent flyer programs  through luggage check in  reciprocal airport lounge access  joint marketing  sharing of airport facilities and joint procurement of certain goods and services 
northwest and its alliance partners currently provide a global network to over cities in countries on six continents 
in august  the company announced that it had signed a cooperative marketing agreement with continental and delta 
this agreement is designed to connect the three carriers domestic and international networks and provide for codesharing  reciprocity of frequent flyer programs  airport club use and other cooperative activities 
northwest  continental and delta received approval of the agreement from the doj and the dot in the first quarter of the three airlines began implementing the agreement in june by offering access to each other s airport lounges and by offering codeshare service 
beginning in july  frequent flyer members of the three airlines have been able to book and redeem miles for itineraries that include any combination of northwest  continental and delta operated flights by using a single award 
in the fourth quarter of  northwest and delta expanded their codesharing to daily domestic flights operated by each carrier  the maximum permitted by the dot as of that time 
in june  the next phase may be implemented by adding code sharing on another daily domestic flights 
the combined network has increased northwest s presence in the south  east and mountain west regions of the us  as well as in latin america 
in september  klm announced that it would enter into an agreement with air france to form a strategic business partnership  which would create europe s largest airline group and unite the two carriers under the same corporate holding company 
in february  the european union antitrust investigators gave their conditional approval of this merger 
the klm northwest trans atlantic joint venture will remain in place pursuant to their alliance agreement 
it is anticipated that klm will join the skyteam global alliance of which air france and delta are the founding members in the spring of northwest also expects to join the skyteam alliance in northwest also has domestic frequent flyer and codesharing agreements with several other airlines including alaska horizon airlines  hawaiian airlines  america west airlines and american eagle

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risks inherent in the company s market sensitive instruments and positions are the potential losses arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate its exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ from the outcomes estimated in the analysis due to factors beyond the company s control 
see item consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  note risk management and financial instruments  for related accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
the company s earnings are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
from time to time  the company manages the price risk of fuel costs by utilizing futures contracts traded on regulated futures exchanges  swap agreements and options 
a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel  assuming projected fuel usage  would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million net of hedging for measured at december  as of december   the company had no fuel hedges in place compared to hedges on and of the first quarter and full year requirements  respectively  at december  foreign currency 
the company is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the us dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
the company s largest exposure comes from the japanese yen 
from time to time  the company uses financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the japanese yen 
the result of a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december  levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company s revenues and expenses are denominated would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million for the year ending december   compared to an estimated decrease of million for measured at december  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses as of december  and the variance is due to the company s foreign currency denominated revenues exceeding its foreign currency denominated expenses 
the company also has foreign currency exposure as a result of changes to balance sheet items 
the result of a weakening in the value of the us dollar would result in an decrease to other income of an estimated million in  caused by the remeasurement of net foreign currency denominated assets as of december   compared with an estimated increase of million caused by the remeasurement of net foreign currency denominated liabilities at december  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities as of december  and in  the company s yen denominated net cash inflow was approximately billion yen approximately million and its yen denominated liabilities exceeded its yen denominated assets by an average of billion yen approximately million compared with billion yen approximately million and billion yen approximately million  respectively  in in general  each time the yen strengthens weakens  the company s operating income is favorably unfavorably impacted due to net yen denominated revenues exceeding expenses and a non operating foreign currency loss gain is recognized due to the remeasurement of net yen denominated liabilities 
the company s operating income in was favorably impacted by approximately million due to the average yen being stronger in compared to and unfavorably impacted in by approximately million due to the average yen being weaker in compared to the average yen to us dollar exchange rate for the years ending december   and was  and  respectively 
including the impact of hedge activities  the average yen to us dollar exchange rate for the years ending december   and was  and  respectively 
the japanese yen financial instruments utilized to hedge net yen denominated cash flows resulted in gains of million and million in and  respectively 
as of december   the company had entered into forward contracts to hedge approximately and of its anticipated and yen denominated sales at an average rate of and yen per us dollar  respectively 
this compares to of sales hedged as of december  interest 
the company s earnings are also affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on its interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments and its interest expense from floating rate debt instruments 
if short term interest rates increased by basis points for a year  based on the company s cash balance at december   the company s interest income from cash equivalents and short term investments would increase by approximately million compared to an estimated million based on the company s cash balance at december  the company s floating rate indebtedness was approximately and of its total long term debt and capital lease obligations at december  and  respectively 
if long term floating interest rates increased by basis points during as measured at december   the company s interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured at december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the company s floating rate indebtedness  cash equivalent and short term investment balances at december  and market risk for fixed rate indebtedness is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates and amounts to approximately million during measured at december   compared to an estimated million for measured at december  the fair values of the company s indebtedness were estimated using estimated or quoted market prices and discounted future cash flows based on the company s incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements
