item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results our primary source of revenue is from retail sales of eyeglasses  contact lenses and other optical merchandise in the vision centers we operate within host environments and on military bases 
in we also began selling vision examination insurance in our california stores 
in  we began manufacturing eyeglasses for a fifteen store independent optical chain 
fiscal was the first year in which we closed a significant number of domestic vision centers as we reached the end of their contractual option period 
we had opened our th domestic wal mart store in and still operated of these at the end of during  forty of these leases expired and we operated vision centers within domestic wal mart locations at january  during  we expect to close an additional stores  including thirteen stores whose leases were not scheduled to expire  but which we requested to close because of poor operating results and prospects 
in  we began to narrow our strategies for coping with the gradual closing of stores 
we settled on three dominant strategies first  we focused on optimizing the profitability of our existing stores to help maximize the time available to develop new  sustainable growth vehicles 
next  we reviewed and tested growth opportunities within optics 
finally  we have identified and will begin testing non optics opportunities inside wal mart 
we made significant changes in our existing optical business in these changes began to benefit our financial results by late in the third quarter of  and we expect that they will benefit future periods as well 
the financial impact of these changes is discussed in further detail in the following sections 
in addition to the operational changes  we also tested two concepts within the optics category in operating optical kiosks within a mall environment and selling disposable hearing aids and hearing exams within existing vision centers 
neither of these concepts was sufficiently successful to justify continued investment  and both tests were stopped by the end of the year 
the financial impact of these two tests was not significant to us 

table of contents results of operations our results of operations in any period are significantly affected by the number and mix of vision centers operating during such period 
at january   we operated vision centers  versus vision centers at december  and vision centers at december  the following table sets forth information about the number and type of vision centers we owned and operated as of the end of fiscal  and  respectively

in accordance with fresh start accounting  all assets and liabilities were restated to reflect their respective fair values 
the consolidated financial statements after that date are those of a new reporting entity and are not comparable to the periods prior to emergence 
however  for purposes of this discussion  the successor results for the seven months ended december  have been combined with the predecessor results of five months ended june  differences resulting from fresh start accounting are explained when necessary 

table of contents continuing operations total net revenue 
total net revenue is comprised of retail sales  premium revenues and other revenues 
in  total domestic comparable store sales were up over the prior year 
domestic comparable store sales for were calculated using the first weeks of compared to fiscal which was a week year 
this calculation only includes vision centers that were open for all of fiscal and the following reconciliation shows the components of the change in retail sales amounts in thousands vs

as a result  fiscal contained weeks whereas and each contained weeks

in addition  this category includes locations that were open for all of and and are included in the domestic comparable store sales calculation 
b this category includes individual store locations that were not open for all of and  and  therefore  were not part of the domestic comparable store sales calculation 
c our mexico operations are consolidated using the calendar months ended november th each year 
during we made several changes to help drive domestic sales 
although it is difficult to quantify the result of each of these activities  we believe that the following factors had the most significant impact on our retail domestic comparable store sales increase of million or over we implemented significant merchandising changes in every major category frames  spectacle lenses and contact lenses to modernize our collection and simplify the presentation for the customer 
the most significant category changes are as follows a 
in the first quarter of  we updated our frame collection to modernize and simplify our presentation 
as part of this process  we substantially reduced the number of frame vendors  consolidated price points  and enhanced the presentation of frames to make them more brand focused for the customer  and easier to manage for our associates 
b 
during the first half of  we aligned our contact lens selection with the products most frequently prescribed by our independent doctors 
this favorably impacted our contact lens sales  which are up approximately over and approximately over c 
we also updated our accessory collection to complement our spectacle offering  increasing accessory sales by approximately over we restructured our personnel scheduling at the store level to provide for consistent coverage based on operating needs by sales volume levels we amended our incentive programs to increase potential participation by  and therefore the productivity of  our associates 

table of contents our domestic comparable store sales increase of approximately million over was largely the result of a change in our frame and lens presentation 
historically  our in store presentation of frame and lens options was based on a package price concept 
the package price included a pair of base lenses  a frame and certain lens options 
in july  we changed our presentation strategy by unbundling the package price so that pricing for frames and lenses is presented separately in the store 
the presentation is intended to be clearer as well as more concise and customer friendly  and is similar to product and price presentation at a majority of our competitors stores 
after an initial orientation phase  we experienced increases in the number of spectacle units sold and in the average spectacle transaction value 
managed care sales accounted for approximately  and of our sales in  and  respectively 
we work with large and small managed care payors to provide vision benefits to their members 
we expect that retail optical sales through managed vision care programs will increase over the next several years as a percentage of overall retail optical sales 
see risk factors our declining base of vision centers in wal mart stores could make it more difficult for us to compete 
as such  changes in the managed vision care industry are likely to impact our sales 
effective october   a large national managed care payor changed its policy regarding out of network providers 
these changes limited our ability to verify benefit coverage and to accept assignment of the payor s benefits on behalf of our customer 
prior to october  we were generating sales of approximately million on an annualized basis as a result of being an out of network provider for this payor 
the net impact of this change has been a substantial reduction in sales as an out of network provider for this payor 
we are working aggressively to mitigate the decreases in lost sales 
we have attempted to discuss these matters with the payor  but do not believe that the payor intends to change its new policy 
we are evaluating alternatives but can provide no assurance that they will be successful or that we will again be able to participate as an out of network provider for this payor 
we will continue to work toward adding third party plans and payors as part of our ongoing managed care growth strategy 
in may  we began offering a twelve month extended warranty plan in our wal mart vision centers to provide for repair and replacement service during the first year after purchase 
revenue recognized in was approximately million 
by the fourth quarter of  approximately of our eyeglass transactions included an extended warranty purchase 
we expect these increased warranty sales to continue into this revenue is reflected within retail sales  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
the increase of million in premium revenue can be largely attributed to increased enrollments in our california health maintenance organization 
the hmo had  enrollees or participants at the end of compared to  at the end of we began selling this managed care insurance product in the wal mart california vision centers in the second quarter of revenue from premiums is recognized over the life of the policy as the related services are rendered 
in  we began manufacturing eyeglasses for an independent chain of fifteen vision centers 
total revenue from this activity was  during the year 

table of contents gross profit 
the components of sales and gross profit are detailed below dollars in thousands year ended year ended year ended january  december  december  weeks weeks weeks retail sales  net retail cost of goods sold retail gross profit premium revenue claims expense insurance gross profit other revenue other cost of sales other gross profit total net revenue total cost of goods sold total gross profit we attribute the increase in retail gross profit dollars primarily to sales increases arising out of merchandising changes made beginning in mid and continuing throughout we have also established a process for updating our selections on a more regular basis 
eyeglass sales are more than of our retail sales 
therefore  changes in frames and lenses have the greatest impact on our business 
the improvement in gross profit margin percentage and a portion of the improvement are primarily the result of a shift in sales mix towards eyeglasses  coupled with an increase in eyeglass margins due to the company s unbundling of frame and lens pricing 
in the second half of  we began testing different lens offerings to improve eyeglass profit margins and simplify customer presentation 
we have substantially completed our lens test as it relates to single vision lenses  but expect this process to continue for multifocal lenses throughout we have begun to see slight improvements in eyeglass margins as a result of the change in lens offering in the fourth quarter of and expect this to continue 
these improvements in and retail gross profit margins were somewhat reduced by increases in rent as the number of wal mart locations entering the option period of their lease increased in relation to the total number of vision centers 
in  we recorded an effective rent of approximately on revenues from our wal mart locations 
because of minimum rent increases during the option period  we need to increase comparable store sales in order to keep our rent percentage at these levels 
any decrease in sales would have a negative impact on occupancy expense as a percent of sales 
approximately and vision centers were operating within their option period at january  and december   respectively 
the decrease in gross profit dollars is the result of the disposal of the freestanding vision centers in april insurance gross profit represents premium revenue less claims expenses for a managed care product that we began selling in the wal mart california vision centers in the second quarter of this insurance product has significantly lower margins than do our retail products 
the introduction of this product increased total revenues by million over and gross profit dollars by  but decreased total gross profit as a percent of net sales by percentage points 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense 
selling  general and administrative expense includes both store operating expenses and home office overhead costs and is shown below 
selling  general and administrative expense as a percent of total net revenue sales increases in resulted in a reduction of sg a expense as a percent of sales 
expenses are not directly comparable to expenses because of the freestanding stores that were disposed of during the first four months of as a result  comparisons to are not meaningful 
significant factors influencing changes in expenses in are discussed below 
the following factors influenced vision center payroll and field supervision costs 
these costs comprise approximately of our selling  general and administrative expense an increase in retail level compensation of approximately million for this includes store payroll costs and supervision level costs 
substantially all of the increase in base payroll is due to higher rates in certain markets  where availability of dispensing opticians and growing competition resulted in upward pressure on rates for optical personnel 
also in  we restructured payroll scheduling  to provide consistent coverage based on operating need by volume levels 
this change did not have a significant impact on the hours of coverage 
an increase in store level incentive costs of million in due to a change in incentive structure in  combined with improved performance 
an increase in health and medical benefit costs of approximately  in the following factors influenced other expenses included within the selling  general and administrative expense category workers compensation expense  which increased approximately  in this increase was due to adverse development of claims from previous years  particularly in california 
an increase in professional fees of approximately  in  a portion of which was incurred as a result of the re audit of the financial statements and the completion of the financial statements 
additionally  during  we realized a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million largely due to leasehold improvements and equipment at some stores becoming fully depreciated 
we expect this decline in depreciation expense to continue  but to a lesser degree 
restructuring expense 
during august  we initiated and completed a restructuring of the retail field and home office retail support center 
the process resulted in a reduction in headcount approximating of both the retail field management organization and the home office retail support center organization 
the cost of the restructuring process was  which included separation costs and outplacement costs 
the annual payroll and related costs represented by the reduction in force was approximately million 
we cannot guarantee the savings from this reduction in force will reduce our payroll and related costs in subsequent years or that it will reduce such expense by the same or similar amounts in subsequent years 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
historically  we have operated our vision centers to the maximum term of the lease  including the exercise of all available renewal options in most cases 
our strategy was to maintain store operations  even if the store was under performing and devote our attention to correcting the store s problems 
in the fourth quarter of  we revised our strategy to assess under performing stores prior to the lease termination date  and potentially close the under performing stores in order to maximize operating profitability 
as a result  we identified certain store locations with a history of operating losses that we do not expect to become profitable without significant cost and effort 
we intend to close of these locations in march and april of closing these vision centers prior to the end of their lease term or option period allows us to focus greater attention on maximizing profits from more promising locations and developing a new business model 
for the locations that we expect to close prior to the lease termination date  we reviewed the locations for potential impairment by comparing the future expected undiscounted cash flows for these locations to the carrying value of their long lived assets 
the long lived asset carrying value for of the locations exceeded the future expected undiscounted cash flows from the locations 
therefore  impairment was determined to exist for these locations 
we also reviewed the remainder of store locations for potential impairment and identified additional vision centers in wal mart  wal mart de mexico  fred meyer and on military bases which were determined to be impaired given that the expected future undiscounted cash flows from these locations are less than the carrying value of their assets 
as a result  we have recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to write down these long lived assets to their fair market value 
fair market value was determined using the expected discounted cash flows for each location 
this impairment was reflected for leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment at these locations 
interest expense 
the outstanding balance of our long term senior subordinated notes is the primary driver of interest expense 
interest expense decreased by approximately million in compared to due to principal repayments and note repurchases made during and during the first five months of  when we were under the protection of the bankruptcy court  we did not accrue interest expense on our former senior subordinated notes outstanding of million 
when we emerged from bankruptcy on may   we restructured our debt and began accruing interest at on our million of newly issued senior subordinated notes 
the table below rolls forward our long term outstanding debt balances for  and and the principal repayments and note repurchases made each year in thousands senior subordinated notes outstanding at beginning of year mandatory redemptions  at par repurchases at discounted prices retirement of unissued notes senior subordinated notes outstanding at end of year weighted average balance outstanding for the year the outstanding senior note balance at december  is not comparable to senior notes outstanding at the beginning of the outstanding notes at the beginning of were issued by the predecessor and were not accruing interest due to our chapter proceedings 
the weighted average balance outstanding for is not meaningful 
gain on repurchase of notes

table of contents discontinued operations 
during  of our vision center leases expired  resulting in the closure of wal mart vision centers and vision centers on military bases 
in addition  during the second and third quarter of  we closed under performing vision centers in fred meyer locations prior to their scheduled lease expiration 
condensed information for these closed stores is presented below

we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf at the beginning of this issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances 
prior to fiscal  we received vendor allowances through co op advertising agreements  which were classified in the income statement as a reduction of advertising expense 
as a result of the adoption of eitf  certain vendor allowances  which formerly were treated as a reduction in advertising costs  are presented as a reduction of inventory cost and subsequently as a component of cost of goods sold 
on the first day of fiscal  we recorded additional expense of  as the cumulative effect for this change in accounting principle 
this amount reflects the portion of vendor allowances that would have reduced inventory costs had this new accounting pronouncement been in effect at the end of

ebitda is calculated as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  non cash items  and reorganization items as defined in the terms of our senior subordinated debt indenture 
we refer to ebitda because it is the basis for the calculation of the excess cash flow principal repayment under our senior subordinated notes  and it is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to service or incur indebtedness 
ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs  should not be considered an alternative to net income or to cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an indication of our operating performance or as a measure of liquidity

summary of lease agreements we have agreements governing our operations in host environments 
typically  each agreement is for a base term  followed by an option to renew for a specified length of time 
the agreements provide for payments of base and or percentage rent  and also contain other customary leasing provisions

table of contents domestic wal mart vision centers our agreement with wal mart gave us the right to open vision centers  the last of which opened in our agreement with wal mart also provides that  if wal mart relocates our vision center for any reason  including converting its own store to a supercenter a store which contains a grocery department in addition to the traditional wal mart store offering the term of our lease begins again 
during  locations were relocated  effectively renewing these leases 
for these relocations  an average of months were added to the lease term assuming all available options are exercised 
we expect approximately to leases to relocate to supercenters in we expect the relocations to add an average of approximately months to each relocated vision center s maximum lease term 
as of january   we have vision centers located in wal mart supercenters 
we believe that wal mart may in the future convert many of its stores and thereby cause many of our leases to start again 
the number of lease expirations indicated could decrease if there are future supercenter conversions 
we have received no assurances from wal mart as to how many of their locations will ultimately be converted 
on a frequent basis  we monitor the number of vision centers along with total lease months remaining under the wal mart master license agreement 
our measurement of lease months assumes that we exercise all available renewal options  exclusive of known and expected non renewals  and that supercenter conversions currently scheduled will trigger new vision center leases 
the remaining lease months may be affected by the conversion of the host store to a supercenter 
additionally  the remaining lease months may be affected by our decisions regarding exercise of lease renewal options 
lease months shown reflect expected vision center relocations  whether confirmed or unconfirmed  the expected closure of locations prior to the end of their lease term  and any lease options that are not expected to be exercised 
the following table lists our remaining lease months under our wal mart agreement as of the respective fiscal months 
as of the end of fiscal month lease months remaining january february march april may june july august september october november december january february we view remaining lease months as a proxy for the remaining cash flow associated with the operations of our existing vision centers under our agreement with wal mart 
we recognize  however  that there is no necessary connection between remaining lease months and expected cash flow and that our declining base of vision centers could make it more difficult for us to maintain current levels of cash flow recorded by our existing vision centers see risk factors our declining base of vision centers in wal mart stores could make it more difficult for us to compete 
in  leases are expected to close over the course of the year  in the first quarter  in the second quarter  in the third quarter  and in the fourth quarter 
these stores represent annualized sales of approximately million and annualized store level operating income of approximately million 
of the wal mart leases expected to close in  we have elected to close locations prior to the end of their term due to store level operating losses 
store level operating income excludes corporate overhead and other costs not specifically attributable to individual stores 
the leases had an average of months remaining  assuming all options were exercised 
as of march   we have closed wal mart vision centers in fiscal we have experienced sales declines of approximately in the final month of operations for stores that are closing 
we also have incurred store closing costs  including severance  that has averaged between  and  per vision center 
as of january   we had vision centers that were operating in the three year extension period of the wal mart lease 
we exercised our option to renew the leases for the three year extension period for wal mart vision centers in the base term for vision centers expires in  and we will need to determine which leases to extend 
at this time  we have elected to close of these locations at the end of the original nine year lease 
we expect to exercise the option for many of our leases 
these decisions will be based on various factors  including sales levels  anticipated future profitability  increased minimum rental fees in the option period  and market share 

table of contents other operations in july  we amended our agreement with fred meyer 
our new agreement provides an extension of the original lease term from december  to december  and eliminates the five year option to extend the agreement 
the amendment also revises the rent structure  beginning in  to better align rent obligations with individual store performance 
beginning in  we expect to realize rent cost savings on an annualized basis of approximately million  based on each vision center s sales levels in changes in these sales could have an impact on anticipated rent reductions 
the amendment also permitted the closure of under performing locations 
five of these vision centers closed in the second quarter of  and the remaining seven were closed in the third quarter of our agreement with wal mart de mexico provides that each party will not deal with other parties to operate leased department vision centers in mexico 
this agreement also permits each party to terminate the lease for each vision center which fails to meet minimum sales requirements specified in the agreement 
under our agreement with wal mart de mexico  we have two options for two year renewals and one option for an additional one year renewal for each vision center 
as of january   three of our vision centers in mexico are operating beyond the original lease term  on a month to month basis 
we are currently in negotiations with wal mart de mexico to amend our existing lease agreement to allow wal mart de mexico to perform their own vision center tests for a limited time 
should these negotiations be unsuccessful  we would likely close the three locations which are operating beyond the original lease term and continue to operate the remaining locations until such time that their lease expires 
the following table sets forth the number of our vision center leases that expire each year  assuming that we exercise all available options to extend the terms of the leases  excluding such options we have declined or expect to decline to renew as of march  this table includes future wal mart supercenter conversions which are scheduled at this time 
these supercenter conversions added an average of months to each location s lease term 
leases expiring in fiscal year actual projected and host company thereafter wal mart domestic mexico fred meyer military totals we meet with representatives of our host companies on a regular basis and periodically discuss proposed amendments to our master license agreements  as well as expansion opportunities 
we can provide no assurances that we will enter into favorable amendments to these agreements or that we will have any opportunities to expand our operations within any of our current host environments 

table of contents operating strategies during much of  we focused heavily upon making changes that would improve our operations and cash flows 
the changes affected almost every aspect of our base business  including our frame and lens selection  retail pricing and in store display  store scheduling  manager and associate incentive programs  training and evaluation  and home office and field supervision staffing levels 
we expect these moves to begin to have a significant impact on operating results in  and we will also continue to test and refine other potential improvements 
we cannot provide any assurances as to whether such changes will have a positive impact on our operating results or financial condition 
we also tested two new business concepts in  selling eyeglasses from kiosks inside malls and adding a new hearing aid technology to the traditional vision products offered in our optical stores 
we tested the eyeglass kiosks in one location and the hearing aid product in two optical stores in wal mart 
neither of these concepts warranted expansion and both were discontinued by the end of the year 
the combined cost of testing these two concepts was approximately  in  our focus will turn more toward developing a new business that could potentially replace our declining base of stores inside wal mart 
we will continue to seek avenues of growth within optics while also seeking new businesses to grow within wal mart 
one new business upon which we are presently focused is the home medical equipment hme business 
the hme category includes wheelchairs  scooters  walkers  bathroom safety seats  shower rails and many other aids to daily living 
in our view  the hme marketplace is similar to the optics marketplace of several years ago  when there were no large  dominant national retailers serving the category 
the marketplace currently consists mostly of independent operators and we believe it is poised for a gradual shift to larger national players 
we believe that our expertise and experience in optical retailing will give us certain advantages in the home medical equipment business 
both categories benefit from an aging population and involve a quasi medical sales consultation with virtually every customer 
both require managed care expertise 
importantly  both categories benefit greatly from the consumer awareness generated by walk by traffic in a wal mart environment 
in the second quarter of  we expect to open hme test stores inside wal mart stores in pennsylvania and tennessee 
in each of these locations  the population demographics are favorable to an hme business 
we anticipate that  by early  we will have sufficient information to determine whether this concept should be expanded 
we believe that other companies are testing the sales of home medical equipment in wal mart stores 
the note indenture may limit the expenditures we are able to make in businesses outside of optical 
see risk factors our pursuit of other lines of business could be constrained by the terms of our indenture 
we have begun reviews of other potential businesses that could possibly benefit from the type of traffic that wal mart stores generate 
none of these concepts is as far advanced as the hme concept 
as to our potential new businesses  including the hme concept  we cannot presently predict whether any will be successful 
we also cannot predict how many locations we may receive in wal mart stores or the terms of any such lease arrangements 
see risk factors our operation of optometric vision centers adjacent to wal mart corporate vision centers in california creates financial and regulatory risk 
within optics  in the first quarter of our hmo began opening optometric offices in california wal mart stores adjacent to a vision center operated by wal mart 
at march   we have opened four such offices 
of these  three were in wal mart stores in which our leases had expired in and one was in a recently opened wal mart 
in addition  we also opened an optometric office in one california sam s club location 
we contract with optometrists to provide eye examinations in these locations with doctor coverage running as much as hours per week in the busier locations 
we estimate that an optometric office will provide less revenue and income than an average vision center 
nonetheless  we consider this an excellent opportunity to continue deriving a revenue stream from stores in which we had previously operated a vision center while adding a revenue stream for newly opened wal mart and sam s locations 
we expect to open additional such offices in and see risk factors our operation of optometric vision centers adjacent to wal mart corporate vision centers in california creates financial and regulatory risk 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since emerging from bankruptcy on may   our operations have generated cash flow in amounts sufficient to fund operating and interest expense  capital expenditures of million  mandatory principal redemptions of million and discounted debt repurchases costing million 
we maintain a revolving credit line with fleet capital corporation  a commercial lender  but have generally made borrowings under the credit line for only brief periods of time  near the end of our fiscal first quarter  when several large periodic payments are made 
we also utilize a portion of our line of credit on a year round basis to support a letter of credit required by our workers compensation insurance provider 
as of march   our unused availability under our credit facility with fleet was approximately million 
at january   we had no borrowings under our credit facility  and had letters of credit of million outstanding 
we believe that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements throughout we expect that funds available under our credit facility will be utilized only for short term liquidity needs  if at all 
we intend to use available cash for our ongoing operations  repurchase of notes  and repayment of principal on our outstanding debt 
in december  we amended our credit facility with fleet capital corporation the fleet facility 
the amendment extended the expiration date of the fleet facility from may  to may  and eliminated the previous limit of million in expenditures for repurchases of our senior subordinated notes within each rolling month period 
the amendment enables us to repurchase notes upon meeting certain financial criteria both preceding and following the repurchases 
additionally  the amendment increased availability by approximately million 
subsequent to the amendment  we repurchased our senior subordinated notes with a face value of million for million resulting in a non cash gain of million 
our fleet facility contains various restrictive covenants  including requirements that we maintain minimum levels of ebitda as defined  maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of to  and limit our capital expenditures 
we made mandatory principal redemption payments of million on august  and million on february  we also made a principal redemption payment on the notes of approximately  on february  to the trustee for note holders of record on february  these redemptions are based on the requirements of the indenture and are made at of par 
each principal redemption payment is based on the results for the six month period ending in june or december  respectively 
in addition  we made an interest payment of approximately million from existing cash balances on september  the next scheduled interest payment of approximately million was made on march  in may  we began offering a twelve month extended warranty plan in our wal mart vision centers to provide for repair and replacement service during the first year after purchase 
the new warranty plan has gained considerable consumer acceptance  and we now sell warranties with approximately of all eyeglass transactions 
this revenue is deferred over the life of the warranty 
our deferred warranty revenue at january  was approximately million 
in fiscal  we received approximately million in cash from the sale of warranties 
we expect to receive at least this amount in fiscal the company s capital expenditures have historically been for store openings  relocations  and remodeling  lensmaking and other optometric equipment 
during  we expect to open at least two military stores and to relocate to vision centers within wal mart that have converted to supercenters 
these store openings are subject to change depending upon construction schedules and other constraints 
for each new center  we expect to spend between  and  for fixed assets and up to  for inventory 
during  we plan to test at least two home medical equipment centers inside wal mart stores 
as with all of our test concepts  we plan to prudently invest in this new idea  until we prove that this concept has the consumer acceptance needed to become our next growth vehicle 
we expect to invest approximately  in fixed assets and inventory in each of our first two test locations see risk factors our pursuit of other lines of business could be constrained by the terms of our indenture 
other new business concepts that we might pursue could require substantial investments  but none of these efforts are advanced enough at this time to predict what such expenditures might be 

table of contents future commitments as of january   we had no capital lease obligations or other long term liabilities except the senior subordinated notes 
the table below sets forth our contractual obligations amounts in thousands payments due by fiscal year thereafter total long term debt obligations a operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c a our senior subordinated debt agreement provides for semi annual principal repayments based on the results of operations for the six month periods ended in june and december 
the timing of future principal repayments is contingent upon future results 
accordingly  except for the payment that was made on february   the total carrying value is presented as long term debt obligations  due upon maturity in b our operating lease obligations represent minimum rent payments under our wal mart  fred meyer and various military agreements as well as miscellaneous operating equipment leases 
c our purchase obligations represent minimum purchase requirements for local phone and certain other data services including polling and internet capability 
inflation although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our domestic sales or results of operations 
we cannot determine whether inflation will have a material long term effect on our sales or results of operations 
as a result of inflation in prior years  we have in the past adjusted our retail pricing 
further pricing adjustments are contingent upon competitive pricing levels in the marketplace 
management is monitoring the continuing impact of these inflationary trends 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements  as discussed under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments and incorporates any changes in such estimates and judgments into the accounting records underlying our consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we defer revenue recognition until delivery of the product by estimating the value of transactions in which final delivery to the customer has not occurred at the end of the period presented 
the amount of cash received at the time the customer s order is placed is recorded as a deposit liability and is presented within accrued liabilities 
these estimates are based on historical trends and take into consideration current changes in our manufacturing and distribution process 
we currently sell separately priced extended warranty contracts  generally with terms of twelve months 
revenues from the sale of these contracts are deferred and amortized over the life of the contract on a straight line basis 
the costs to service the warranty claims are expensed as incurred 
these warranty contracts currently generate a positive profit margin 
however  if the utilization rates of these warranties increased significantly  the repair and replacement expense could exceed the sales price of these warranties 
if that became the case  we would record a future liability for anticipated warranty claims at the time of sale  instead of expensing the warranty claims as incurred 
premium revenue is earned from hmo memberships and services 
revenue from premiums is recognized over the life of the policy  generally twelve months  as the related services are rendered 
we must make estimates of potential returns and replacements of all or part of the eyewear sold to a customer 
we analyze historical remake and warranty activity  consider current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our estimate of these costs 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  this would likely result in differences in the amount and timing of revenue and related costs for any period 
allowance for uncollectible managed care receivables managed care accounts receivable are recorded net of contractual allowances and reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
a significant portion of our receivables are due from health care plans or third party administrators located throughout the united states 
approximately of our net sales relate to products sold to customers that ultimately will be funded in full or in part through private insurance plans  third party insurance administration programs or government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
any failure on our part to accurately and timely file for reimbursement with these programs can have an adverse effect on our collection results which  in turn  will have an adverse effect on liquidity and profitability 
estimates of our allowance for uncollectible receivables are based on our historical billing and collection experience 
changes in our billing and collection processes  changes in funding policies by insurance plans and changes in our sales mix within insurance plans may have a material effect on the amount and timing of our estimated expense requirements 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
in most cases  the expected sales value ie  market value of our inventory is higher than its cost 
however  as we progress through a selling season  certain slow moving merchandise may be removed from stores and returned to the distribution center to be sold below cost in secondary markets 
as a result  there is a high degree of judgment and complexity in determining the market value of such inventories 
for inventory on hand  we estimate the future selling price of our merchandise  given its current selling price and its planned promotional activities  and provide a reserve for the difference between cost and the expected selling price for all items expected to be sold below cost 
at the beginning of fiscal  we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
as a result of the adoption of eitf  certain vendor allowances are now presented as a reduction of inventory cost and subsequently as a component of cost of goods sold 

table of contents we conduct physical inventory counts for all of our store locations at least twice per year and adjust our records to reflect the actual inventory counts 
cycle counts are performed monthly for inventory in our distribution center and all inventory in our distribution center is counted near the end of the fiscal year 
as all locations are not counted as of our reporting dates  we provide a reserve for inventory shrinkage based principally on historical inventory shrinkage experience 
fresh start accounting in accounting for the effects of the reorganization  we adopted fresh start accounting principles as contained in the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code sop 
sop was applicable because pre reorganization shareholders received none of our new common stock and the reorganization value of the assets of the successor company was less than the total pre petition liabilities allowed plus post petition liabilities 
sop also required that  at the time of fresh start accounting  we early adopted all accounting principles that were required to be adopted within twelve months following fresh start accounting 
fresh start accounting principles require that we determine the reorganization value of the reorganized company 
our reorganization value was developed by management  the official committee of unsecured creditors and their respective financial advisors 
the reorganization value was based on a calculation of the present value of the free cash flows under our financial projections  including an assumption of a terminal value 
such projections were submitted to the bankruptcy court and to creditors for review and objection as part of our disclosure statement accompanying the plan 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets our most significant intangible asset is the intangible value of contractual rights  which was established as part of our adoption of fresh start accounting in may this intangible asset  which has a value of million at january   represents the value of our lease agreement with wal mart and the business relationship therein created 
in accordance with sfas no 
 this intangible is an amortizable asset because it has a finite useful life 
however  the precise length of its life is not known due primarily to the wal mart supercenter conversions that automatically trigger extensions on the contractual life of the asset 
based on our projections  our best estimate of the useful life of this asset is fifteen years 
due to the uncertainty involved in predicting the pattern of economic benefits realized from the wal mart relationship  we amortize this asset using the straight line method 
we assess the impairment of all identifiable intangibles and long lived assets on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include a significant underperformance of vision center operations relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of our assets or the strategy for our overall retail optical business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline or adverse change in the rate or geographic concentration of wal mart host store relocations or supercenter conversions  and a permanent adverse change in cash flows generated by an operation 
upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we determine if the carrying value of intangibles or long lived assets may not be recoverable based on a projected cash flow model 
if the projected cash flows are not in excess of the book value of the related asset  we measure the impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
significant management judgment is required regarding the existence of impairment indicators as discussed above 
historically  we have operated our vision centers to the maximum term of the lease  including the exercise of all available renewal options in most cases 
our strategy was to maintain store operations  even if the store was under performing and devote our attention to correcting the store s problems 
in the fourth quarter of  we revised our strategy to assess under performing stores prior to the lease termination date  and potentially close the under performing stores in order to maximize operating profitability 
as a result  we identified certain store locations with a history of operating losses that we do not expect to become profitable without significant cost and effort 
we intend to close of these locations in march and april of for the locations that we expect to close prior to the lease termination date  we reviewed the locations for potential impairment by comparing the future expected undiscounted cash flows for these locations to the carrying value of their long lived assets 
the long lived asset carrying value for locations exceeded the future expected undiscounted cash flows from the locations 
therefore  impairment was determined to exist for these locations 
we also reviewed the remainder of store locations for potential impairment and identified additional vision centers in wal mart  wal mart de mexico  fred meyer and on military bases which were determined to be impaired given that the expected future undiscounted cash flows from these locations are less than the carrying value of their assets 
as a result  we have recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to write down these long lived assets to their fair market value 
fair market value was determined using the expected discounted cash flows for each location 
this impairment was reflected for leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment at these locations 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that long lived assets or intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
based on our review of our intangible assets as of january   no impairment was determined to exist 

table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as equipment depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we emerged from chapter bankruptcy on may  as part of our plan of reorganization  our capital structure was highly leveraged with million of senior subordinated notes providing for interest at per annum 
before  during and after the bankruptcy process  we incurred significant net operating losses nol that resulted in tax loss carry forwards 
a portion of these carry forwards are subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset associated with this nol if it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize it to offset future taxes 
we have provided a full valuation allowance against this net deferred tax asset because our high leverage will make it difficult for us to become profitable  and our historical high leverage substantially contributed to our failure to achieve profitability 
we currently provide for income taxes only to the extent that we expect to pay cash taxes for current income 
it is possible  however  that we could be profitable in the future at levels which cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of the nol carry forward 
upon reaching such a conclusion  we would immediately record the estimated net realizable value at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although our cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is utilized 
self insurance accruals we self insure estimated costs associated with workers compensation claims and group medical liabilities  up to certain limits 
insurance reserves are established based on actuarial estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims  as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  however actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
other accounting policies the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of other 
fin requires footnote disclosure of the guarantee or indemnification agreements a company issues 
with certain exceptions  these agreements will also require a company to prospectively recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees  including product warranty liabilities  issued or modified after december  our adoption of fin no 
on december  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
 fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  our adoption of fin does not currently have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement was effective immediately for all financial instruments created or modified after may  and by the first interim period commencing after june  for existing financial instruments 
the adoption of sfas no 
does not currently affect our financial position or results of operations 
risk factors this form k contains a number of statements about the future 
it also contains statements which involve assumptions about the future 
all these statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements represent our expectations or belief concerning future events  including any statements regarding future sales levels  the continuation of historical trends  and our liquidity 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
in addition  we  through our senior management  from time to time make forward looking public statements concerning our expected future operations and performance and other developments 
these forward looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting our best judgment based upon current information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to the company and persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this report 
we do not know whether all the forward looking statements made in this report or elsewhere will prove to be correct 
we have tried to identify factors which may cause such statements to be incorrect  but we may not have identified all of them 
these factors could also have a negative impact on our results 
the following is our non exclusive list of these factors our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our notes 
as a result of the issuance of our notes due  we are highly leveraged 
the notes are subordinated to our credit facility 
as of march   we had outstanding total indebtedness of million represented by the notes  and total availability of million under our credit facility  after letter of credit requirements 
our ability to pay or refinance our indebtedness  including our ability to repay the notes  or to fund capital expenditures will depend on our future performance 
to a certain extent  our performance is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  that revenue growth will be realized or that future borrowings will be available under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness  including the notes  or to fund our other liquidity needs 

table of contents our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the notes  including our ability to pay off the notes at maturity  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  new business opportunities  and other general corporate requirements  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  new business opportunities  or other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and our industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt  and limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indenture and credit facility  our ability to borrow additional funds 
our failure to comply with the covenants in the indenture under which our notes were issued or in our credit facility would result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on us 
our ability to continue to generate revenue and operating income depends on our continued relationship with wal mart 
we are substantially dependent on wal mart and its affiliates for our current operations 
the following chart shows  as of january   the number of our vision centers that are in wal mart stores and the total number of our vision centers category number total vision centers domestic wal mart locations wal mart de mexico our vision centers located in wal mart stores accounted for substantially all of our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the fiscal year ended january  vision centers in wal mart stores rely largely on customer traffic generated by the wal mart host store 
wal mart is under no obligation to provide us with additional vision center leases 
we have no basis to believe that wal mart will offer us any additional locations 
we also have no basis to believe that wal mart will offer to extend any of our existing leases apart from instances where wal mart is obligated to do so pursuant to the terms of our master license agreement upon the relocation or conversion of a store to a supercenter see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary of lease agreements 
we will therefore need to replace our sales and operating earnings generated from our wal mart vision centers with sales and operating earnings generated from new business opportunities  which are subject to significant risk and uncertainty see our new business opportunities are unproven 

table of contents our lack of growth could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our notes 
average annual revenues in our domestic wal mart vision centers were approximately  in fiscal average annual revenues in the other vision centers that we continue to own were less than  in the same period 
the expiration of our leases with wal mart will cause a reduction in our revenues that we may not be able to replace with revenues generated by other vision centers or by other lines of business we are exploring 
we expect that our expenses  however  will increase over time 
a combination of lower sales and higher expenses would adversely affect our ability to repay or refinance our notes  which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
in addition  in each of the next several years  the base terms of increasing numbers of leases for vision centers under our wal mart agreement will expire 
our rental obligations to wal mart will increase in the three year option period 
we will need to continue to improve sales at these vision centers 
if we do not  our rent as a percent of sales will increase significantly during the option period for each of these vision centers 
alternatively  we may choose not to exercise the extension options 
our new business opportunities are unproven 
apart from opening optometric offices in california see our operation of optometric vision centers adjacent to wal mart corporate vision centers in california creates financial and regulatory risk  we are exploring optical concepts in hosts other than wal mart and non optical concepts in wal mart 
there are risks associated with both types of business opportunity  including risks that we will be unable to reach appropriate lease or other arrangements with the host licensor the lease or other arrangement will have high occupancy charges or other onerous terms and conditions we will have insufficient capital or otherwise be subject to constraints that limit the investments we can make in these businesses see our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our notes and our pursuit of other lines of business could be constrained by the terms of our indenture even if established  the businesses will fail to generate sufficient profits to justify continued exploration or development of the business concepts 
the optical concepts will be subject to the general risks and uncertainties applicable to our current core business in wal mart 
the non optical concepts will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties  including the risk that we will lack sufficient experience and expertise to successfully manage the businesses 
the home medical equipment business  in particular  is subject to a number of unique risk factors  including intensive regulatory scrutiny under federal and state anti kickback and similar laws see federal and state governments extensively regulate the health care and insurance industries complex regulations and requirements applicable to billing for federal and state reimbursement the need for significant capital to fund any expansion or operating losses during the time the concept is under development 
because of the anticipated run off of our leases with wal mart  we will need to explore and develop these concepts in the shorter rather than the longer term 
there is also a risk that  in pursuing these concepts  management will devote less attention to our core business of operating vision centers in wal mart  and that the core business will be adversely affected 
in addition  other companies are testing the sales of home medical equipment in wal mart stores 
we can therefore provide no assurances that  even if we are successful in these operations  wal mart will offer us additional locations 

table of contents our pursuit of other lines of business could be constrained by the terms of our indenture 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits our operations to those which are the same  similar or reasonably related to the businesses in which we were engaged as of the date we emerged from bankruptcy 
we are in the process of opening home medical equipment centers in wal mart stores 
we are also investigating other concepts 
our indenture could limit our ability to invest in these other lines of business and  generally  could limit our ability to pursue these lines of business 
in addition  certain holders of our notes have previously objected to our engaging in other lines of business 
although we believe that we are in compliance with the indenture and intend to continue to comply with the indenture  we can give no assurance that these holders might not seek to declare a default arising out of our engaging in these lines of business 
our financial performance may be adversely affected by sales recorded at vision centers scheduled to close under the wal mart agreement 
we have observed sharp declines in sales levels as our vision centers come to the end of their lease term under the wal mart agreement 
we expect to close approximately wal mart vision centers in fiscal and wal mart vision centers in fiscal in the months prior to their scheduled date of closure  we expect these vision centers to record substantial sales declines 
the extent of the sales declines  coupled with the number of vision centers nearing the end of their lease term  could have a negative impact on our sales and our profitability 
our declining base of vision centers in wal mart stores could make it more difficult for us to compete 
we expect that the number of our vision centers in wal mart stores will substantially decrease over the next several years 
a declining base of vision centers  coupled with a decline in cash flow  could impair our ability to attract and retain management to compete for managed care contracts to obtain favorable terms  such as discounts and rebates  from optical vendors to enter into other business arrangements to generate cash to fund other business opportunities 
because our optical laboratories and distribution center provide substantially all the eyeglasses and related products we sell at our retail locations  we depend on their regular and efficient operation  and any disruption could have a severe adverse impact on our retail business 
our manufacturing and distribution center operations are subject to various risks 
our manufacturing operations are located in lawrenceville  georgia and st 
cloud  minnesota 
a fire  flood  earthquake  war  work stoppage  supply shortage or disruption  adverse government action or other disaster or condition at either location could result in a loss of production capabilities and  accordingly  adversely affect our ability to service our retail locations 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for raw materials 
most of the raw materials used in our products are readily available from a number of suppliers at competitive prices  and we have not experienced any significant shortages in obtaining raw materials 
while there are currently multiple suppliers of raw materials  we purchase over of those materials from three suppliers 
the loss of any of these suppliers  or a significant decrease in the supply of the raw materials  would require us to obtain these raw materials elsewhere 
if we were unable to obtain the materials from other suppliers at acceptable prices  our gross margins and our ability to implement our every day low price strategy could be adversely affected 
in addition  a third party processes our photochromic lenses using its proprietary technology 
we therefore rely on this party for our production of these lenses 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by environmental and safety regulations to which we are subject 
we must comply with environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  waste water discharges and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes  and with other federal  state and local laws and regulations 
we believe that we possess all material permits and licenses necessary for the continuing operation of our business and believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the terms of all applicable environmental laws 
we cannot assure you that we will operate at all times in complete compliance with all such requirements 
we could be subject to potentially significant fines and penalties for any noncompliance that may occur 
we cannot predict accurately the potential impact of these laws and regulations on us in the future 
our manufacturing operations depend in part on our ability to attract and retain personnel with relevant industry experience 
the loss of the services of this personnel or the ability to retain such personnel in the future could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations 
the efficiency of our manufacturing operations is an essential component of our everyday low price retail strategy 
we must continually control our product manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
we may not be able to continually control these costs and expenses 
to the extent that we do not control these costs and expenses  the ability of our retail locations to compete may be adversely affected 
our operation of optometric vision centers adjacent to wal mart corporate vision centers in california creates financial and regulatory risk 
our hmo subsidiary in california has opened five optometric offices adjacent to wal mart in that state and expects to open more such locations in the future 
there are risks that these locations will be unprofitable and drain cash and management resources although we believe these locations operate in compliance with all applicable regulatory and other requirements  regulatory and other authorities will seek to challenge our operations 
we do not know the number of offices our subsidiary will open pursuant to this arrangement 
the opening of offices in certain geographic locations could be subject to regulatory approval  which could also increase costs and cause delays 
increased military action abroad could have a negative impact on our operations  particularly those on military bases 
we operate vision centers on military bases in the united states 
increased military action abroad could have a negative impact on these vision centers 
our use of net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to limitations 
in conjunction with our historical results from operations  emergence from chapter and the disposition of our free standing operations  we incurred significant net operating losses 
these losses resulted in significant net operating loss carry forwards 
our ability to utilize our net operating losses that were realized prior to our emergence from chapter is limited under section of the internal revenue code of if our net operating losses realized after our emergence from chapter are subject to substantial limitation because of a future change of control of the company or for other reasons  our cash tax costs would increase and have an adverse effect on our ability to repay the notes 
if  after such a change of control  we determined that we would be unable to utilize this tax asset  we could then be forced to write down the asset and record a charge against our financial results 
the right of holders of our notes to receive payments will be junior to our borrowings under our credit facility  which could adversely affect our ability to pay off the notes 
our indebtedness under our credit facility is secured by liens against substantially all of our assets 
in the event of a default on our secured indebtedness  or a bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization of the company and our subsidiaries  these assets will be available to satisfy obligations with respect to the secured indebtedness before they can be used to satisfy our obligations under our notes 

table of contents the terms of our credit facility and the indenture under which our notes were issued restrict our corporate activities 
our credit facility contains various restrictive covenants and requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial tests  such as a minimum requirement of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in our credit facility of million for each rolling month period ending on the last day of each fiscal month for the remainder of the term of our credit facility  and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control  and we cannot assure you we will meet these tests 
in addition  our credit facility and our indenture limit our ability to take action with respect to capital expenditures  investments  indebtedness  liens  dividends  loans  prepayments of other indebtedness  mergers  acquisitions or sales of assets  changes in business activities see our pursuit of other lines of business could be constrained by the terms of our indenture  transactions with affiliates  and issuance of equity 
our breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility 
if a default occurs  our lender can declare our indebtedness  both principal and interest  immediately due and payable  and could terminate its commitment to make future advances 
in addition  a default under the indenture could cause the principal and accrued interest on the notes to become due and payable 
the restrictions in the indenture and the credit facility will likely restrict our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets under our credit facility and under the indenture 
if we fail to repay all amounts declared due and payable  our lender and then the holders of our notes could proceed against the collateral granted to it to satisfy our obligations 
it is likely that our assets would be insufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness  including the notes 
we are required by our indenture to make mandatory redemptions of principal owing on our notes if we generate excess cash flow  which may have an adverse impact on our common stock 
the indenture requires mandatory redemptions of principal out of the excess cash flow that we may generate biannually 
there can be no assurances that we will generate enough excess cash flow to make any mandatory redemptions 
prepayments of principal on the notes  if any  will prevent us from having excess cash to reinvest in our business  and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the holders of our common stock may exercise significant control over us 
former holders of our old senior subordinated notes due held a large majority of our unsecured debt in bankruptcy  and thus were the initial holders of a significant portion of our common stock 
if holders of significant numbers of shares of our common stock act as a group  these holders could be in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors 
certain of these holders have already objected to our repurchase of notes and our pursuit of other business opportunities 

table of contents holders of our common stock and our notes may elect to sell large blocks of common stock or notes  which may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock and our notes 
our former unsecured creditors received our common stock and our notes in exchange for their claims against us 
some or all of the holders of our common stock and notes may prefer to liquidate their investment rather than hold the securities on a long term basis 
the possibility that one or more of the holders of significant numbers of shares of our common stock or a large principal amount of our notes may determine to sell all or a large portion of their shares of our common stock or their notes in a short period of time may adversely affect the market price of the common stock or notes 
partially for that reason  there can be no assurance as to the degree of price volatility in any trading market that may develop for the common stock and the notes 
as a result  no assurance can be given that any holder of our common stock or our notes will be able to sell them or at what price any sale may occur 
no assurance can be given as to the market price  if any  that will prevail for our common stock in the future 
if a market were to exist for our notes  they may trade at prices higher or lower than their face value  depending upon many factors  including  without limitation  the prevailing interest rates  markets for similar securities  industry conditions and the performance of  and investor expectations for us 
our common stock may be delisted from the american stock exchange  if we do not meet certain listing standards 
the rules of the american stock exchange amex allow the exchange to delist securities if the amex determines that a company s securities fail to meet guidelines with respect to corporate net worth  public float  number of shareholders  the aggregate market value of shares  or price per share 
we cannot assure purchasers of our common stock or notes that we will continue to meet the requirements of the amex 
if we are unable to continue to satisfy these criteria  the amex may begin procedures to remove our common stock or notes from the exchange 
if our common stock or notes are delisted  a trading market may no longer exist  and the ability of shareholders to buy and sell common stock or notes may be materially impaired 
we have not declared dividends in the past  and do not anticipate doing so in the near future  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our credit facility and our indenture prohibit the payment of cash dividends without the consent of the lender and the holders of the majority of outstanding principal amounts under the notes  respectively 
we have never declared or paid any dividend on our capital stock 
we currently anticipate that all of our earnings  if any  will be retained for payment of our obligations under the notes  and then for other corporate purposes  and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the retail eyecare industry is extremely competitive 
the retail eyecare industry is extremely competitive 
we compete with national companies  such as lenscrafters and cole and with numerous regional and local firms 
in addition  optometrists  ophthalmologists  and opticians provide many of the same goods and services we provide 
the level and intensity of competition can vary dramatically depending on the particular market 
we believe that we have numerous competitive advantages  such as our everyday low pricing  product selection  and quality and consistency of service 
we also compete for managed care business 
our competition for this business is principally the larger national and regional optical firms 
competition for this business is driven by size of provider network  quality and consistency of service  and by pricing of vision care services 
successful renewals of certain existing third party contracts are integral to maintaining sales revenues 
several of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to engage in extensive and prolonged price promotions which may adversely affect our business 
they may also be able to spend more than we do for advertising 
if we are not able to maintain our market share of the retail optical industry  our business will suffer 
a decline in our earnings could adversely affect the price of our common stock and the notes  and our ability to repay the notes 
luxottica the owner of lenscrafters and cole have recently announced that they have entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which luxottica would purchase cole 
the completion of this merger could have an adverse impact on our ability to compete for managed care accounts and to participate as a provider under managed care arrangements sponsored by the affiliates of luxottica or cole 
this merger  if consummated  could also have other effects on our retail business which we cannot now predict 

table of contents federal and state governments extensively regulate the health care industries 
both federal and state governments extensively regulate the delivery of health care  including relationships among health care providers such as optometrists and eyewear providers like us 
many states prohibit business corporations from practicing medicine or controlling the medical judgments or decisions of physicians 
states often prohibit various financial arrangements  such as splitting fees with physicians 
the fraud and abuse provisions of the social security act and anti kickback laws and regulations adopted in many states prohibit soliciting  paying  receiving or offering any compensation for making  or causing someone to make  referrals of patients  items or services in some circumstances 
the social security act also imposes significant penalties for false or improper medicare and medicaid billings 
many states have adopted similar laws applicable to any payor of health care services 
we must also comply with federal laws such as the health insurance portability and accountability act of which governs our participation in managed care programs and which also requires that we maintain the privacy of health information of our customers and the food and drug administration act which regulates medical devices such as contact lenses 
in addition  the stark self referral law restricts referrals for medicare or medicaid covered services where the referring physician has a financial relationship with the service provider 
in some cases  the rental of space constitutes a financial relationship under this law 
many states have adopted similar self referral laws which are not limited to medicare or medicaid reimbursed services 
violations of these laws may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties  including double and treble civil monetary penalties  and in the case of federal laws  exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
a ruling that we have violated these laws could  for example  result in censure  delicensing of optometrists  civil or criminal penalties  including large civil monetary penalties  invalidation or modification of our agreements with optometrists and opticians  or an order requiring us to change our business practices 
these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business 
also  changes in our relationships with independent optometrists and opticians could adversely affect our relationship with wal mart or our other host stores 
we are subject to state and local regulation of the vision care industry 
the practice of opticianry is regulated in most states in which we do business 
in addition  all states regulate the practice of optometry and many states regulate the contracts and other arrangements between optical firms and optometrists 
our failure to comply with these regulations can have severe consequences  including the closure of retail outlets  possible breaches of our license agreement with wal mart  changes to our way of doing business  and the imposition of fines and penalties 
we are subject to increased regulatory risk in the state of california  where in the california attorney general filed a lawsuit against one of our competitors  alleging that their operations violated state law see legal proceedings 
the case is expected to be argued in the california supreme court later in in  a court of appeal in the state of california held that our method of doing business in the state of california complies with applicable law 
there is  however  a risk that  if the california supreme court holds that the operations of our competitor violates state law  the california attorney general could begin proceedings against us  notwithstanding our prior successful result in the court of appeal 
in addition  the regulatory and litigation risk created by the pendency of the litigation by the attorney general could have an adverse impact on our business 
in california  optometrists who practice adjacent to our retail locations are providers to and subtenants of a subsidiary  which is licensed as a single service health maintenance organization hmo 
this subsidiary is regulated by the department of managed health care 
although we believe that our operations in california comply with applicable law  there are no assurances that the department of managed health care  the attorney general  or another state authority will not seek to challenge our manner of doing business in the state 
such challenges could force us to change the way we do business  to incur significant expense in litigation and compliance efforts  and could have a material adverse impact on us 
local ordinances such as zoning requirements can also impose significant burdens and costs of compliance 
frequently  our competitors sit on state and local boards 
our risks and costs of compliance are often increased as a result 
all of these matters could cause our business to suffer  our ability to repay the notes to be adversely affected  and the trading price of our common stock and notes to decline 

table of contents the departure of key executives could adversely affect our business 
we depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
the departure of these individuals in significant numbers could adversely affect our business and prospects if we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements 
the run off of our vision centers could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain management 
we do not currently have employment agreements with any personnel  including key executive officers and management 
however  we offer our executives and management bonus and stock based incentives related to our performance 
failure to have vision care professionals available in or near our vision centers would adversely affect our ability to win managed care and host store contracts  and could prevent us from operating in some states 
our business and marketing strategies emphasize the availability of independent optometrists in close proximity to our vision centers 
typically  we contract with at least one licensed optometrist to occupy space in or adjacent to each of our stores 
additionally  our agreement with wal mart contemplates that we will make optometrists available at least hours per week if permitted by law 
in some markets it may be difficult for us to attract and retain optometrists if our vision centers generate low sales 
historically  if there is no licensed optometrist available to give eye exams  our retail business has suffered 
in some markets  it can be difficult to hire or keep vision care professionals on staff in our vision centers 
failure to maintain a staff of qualified vision care professionals may cause our customers to go elsewhere to provide for their optical needs  which would have an adverse effect on our business 
many states require that licensed opticians be present when eyeglasses or contact lenses are fitted or dispensed 
any difficulties or delays in securing the services of these professionals could adversely affect our business and our relationship with our host stores 
consequences of difficulty or delay could include termination of our host store licenses for those vision centers  and imposition of legal sanctions against us  including closure of vision centers without licensed professionals 
our success increasingly depends on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with managed vision care companies 
an increasing percentage of patients receive health care coverage through managed care payors 
as this trend continues  our success will increasingly depend on our ability to negotiate contracts with health maintenance organizations referred to as hmos  employer groups and other private third party payors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to establish or maintain satisfactory relationships with managed care and other third party payors 
the run off of our leases with wal mart will make it more difficult for us to establish and maintain these relationships 
in addition  many managed care payors have existing provider structures in place that they may be unable or unwilling to change 
the announced merger of our two largest competitors could present additional challenges to our participation in managed care programs see the retail eyecare industry is extremely competitive 
our inability to enter into arrangements with managed care payors in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have established a network of optometrists and other providers located in or adjacent to our stores in order to enhance our ability to contract with managed care payors for both professional services and retail eyewear supplies 
currently  approximately of our revenues are received from managed care payors 
we expect this percentage to increase in the future 
managed care contracts include a variety of reimbursement methods  such as fee for service or discounts 
our contracts with managed care companies on the one hand  and with networks of optometrists and other providers on the other  are subject to federal and state regulations  for example insurance licensure 
most states impose strict licensure requirements on companies that engage in the business of insurance  including health insurance companies and hmos 
many licensing laws mandate strict financial and other requirements which we may not be able to meet  were we deemed to be engaging in the business of insurance 
additionally  the licensure process can be lengthy and time consuming 
antitrust laws 
a range of antitrust laws apply to us and our network of optometrists 
these laws prohibit anti competitive conduct  including price fixing  concerted refusals to deal  and divisions of markets 
we cannot assure you that our operations will not be challenged on antitrust grounds in the future 

table of contents proposed reforms may affect our earnings and may adversely affect our business 
there have been numerous reform initiatives at the federal and state levels relating to the payment for and availability of healthcare services 
we believe that these initiatives will continue for the foreseeable future 
if adopted  some of these reforms could adversely affect our financial results  and may adversely affect our business 
we rely on third parties to pay many of our customers costs 
a significant portion of medical care in the united states is funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid and company sponsored health insurance plans 
according to government projections  more medical beneficiaries who are significant consumers of eye care services will enroll in managed care organizations 
governmental and private third party payors try to contain medical costs by lowering reimbursements  imposing use restrictions and risk based compensation arrangements  redesigning benefits  and exploring more cost effective methods of health care delivery 
these cost containment efforts may lead to limitations or reductions in reimbursement for eye care services  which would adversely affect our future sales 
additionally  some reimbursement programs require us to collect payment from third party payors 
our inability to fully collect reimbursable amounts could adversely affect cash flow generated from operations 
we depend on reliable and timely reimbursement of claims we submit to third party payors 
there are risks we may not be paid on a timely basis  or that we will be paid at all 
some plans have complex forms to complete 
sometimes our staff may incorrectly complete forms  delaying our reimbursement 
these delays can hurt our cash flow and also force us to write off more of these accounts receivable 
new advances may reduce the need for our products or allow other manufacturers to produce eyewear at lower cost than we can 
technological advances in the eyecare industry  such as new surgical procedures or medical devices  could reduce the demand for our products 
corneal refractive surgery procedures such as laser surgery  radial keratotomy and photo refractive keratectomy may reduce the demand for our products 
the development of new drugs may have a similar effect 
technological advances such as wafer technology and lens casting may make our current lens manufacturing method uncompetitive or obsolete 
the number of individuals electing lasik and similar surgical procedures has increased each year  which could significantly decrease demand for our goods and services 
these and other medical and technological advances may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
a prolonged economic downturn could have an adverse impact on us 
we believe that a weakening economy may cause an increase in the period of time between repurchases of our retail products by the average consumer  since customers may see replacement purchases of eyeglasses and contact lenses as non essential 
an extension of the repurchase cycle for our retail products would reduce the number of sales of our retail products 
lower sales of our retail products would reduce our revenues 
operating in other countries presents special risks that may affect our results of operations 
our mexican operations face risks substantially similar to those we face in our wal mart stores  including dependence on the host store and limits on expansion 
we cannot assure you that our mexican operations will be able to attain profitability 
our foreign operations expose us to all of the risks of investing and operating in foreign countries generally  including differing regulatory  political and governmental environments  currency fluctuations  high inflation  price controls  restrictions on profit repatriation  generally lower per capita income and spending levels  import duties and value added taxes  and difficulties of cross cultural marketing 

table of contents our articles of incorporation  by laws  indenture  and the company shareholder rights agreement contain provisions that make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the company  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws could discourage tender offers or other transactions that would result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock 
these include provisions authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  requiring a supermajority shareholder vote in various circumstances  restricting who may call a special meeting of shareholders  permitting our board of directors to consider constituencies in addition to the shareholders  and requiring shareholders to comply with various procedures in connection with any shareholder proposals or director nominations 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes provides that  upon a change of control as defined  the company is obligated to offer to repurchase all outstanding notes at par 
a change of control is defined to include  among other things  the acquisition by a group of or more of our common stock  and the election of a majority of directors who were not approved by a majority of the prior directors 
our shareholder rights agreement provides us with a defensive mechanism that decreases the risk that a hostile acquirer will attempt to take control of us without negotiating directly with our board of directors 
it is meant to prevent an acquirer from gaining control of us by paying an inadequate price or by using coercive techniques 
the shareholder rights agreement may discourage acquirers from attempting to purchase us  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the change of control repurchase contemplated by our indenture 
upon some changes of control of the company  holders of our notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes 
if a change of control occurs  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds to repurchase all of the notes tendered 
our failure to repurchase tendered notes would be an event of default under our indenture 
changes of control are also restricted by  and constitute a default under  our credit facility 
if the lender under our credit facility were to accelerate our obligations due to a default  it would have a priority claim to the proceeds from the sale of our assets that secure the credit facility 
our adoption of fresh start accounting may make evaluating our financial position and results of operations  as compared to prior periods  more difficult 
due to our emergence from bankruptcy pursuant to our plan of reorganization  we implemented fresh start accounting as of june  in accordance with fresh start accounting  all assets and liabilities were restated to reflect their respective fair values 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements for our reorganized company starting on and going forward from june  will not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to june  the change in our accounting principles may make it more difficult to compare our operations to prior periods 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
we manage market risk on the basis of an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
our financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
our operations are not considered to give rise to significant market risk 
interest rate risk we borrow long term debt under our credit facility at variable interest rates 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
we therefore incur the risk of increased interest costs if interest rates rise 
at january   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
our interest cost under our senior subordinated notes is fixed at through the expiration date of the senior subordinated notes  due foreign currency risk our division in mexico operates in a functional currency other than the us dollar 
the net assets of this division are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
such translation resulted in unrealized losses of approximately  in and unrealized losses of  in historically  we have not attempted to hedge this equity risk
