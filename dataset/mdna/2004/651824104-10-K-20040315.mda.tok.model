financial information regarding our two business segments  and our operations by geographic area  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k beginning on page f a discussion of our net sales by end market and geographic area is included in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we market and sell our products and services through our domestic and international sales organizations  an international network of independent distributors and sales representatives  technical catalogs and our web site 
our domestic and international sales organizations are comprised of teams of field sales persons  which work closely with strategic account managers and internal sales support personnel based in irvine  california and in france 
our oem subsystem and capital equipment customers often have unique technical specifications and manufacturing processes  and may require specific system  subsystem or component designs 
this requires close cooperation between our sales personnel and distributors and our engineering staff  and can result in long sales cycles for our subsystem and capital equipment products 
as of january   we employed persons in our domestic sales organization  and persons in our international sales organization  located in canada  france  germany  italy  the netherlands  singapore  sweden  taiwan  and the united kingdom 

table of contents we currently engage independent sales representatives and distributors that actively market and sell our products in certain markets outside of north america 
we have written agreements with most of our representatives and distributors 
in some cases we have granted representatives and distributors exclusive authorization to sell certain of our products in a specific geographic area 
these agreements generally have terms of one year and are renewable on an annual basis  and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period 
most distributor agreements are structured to provide distributors with sales discounts below the domestic list price 
representatives are generally paid commissions for sales of products 
no single independent representative or distributor accounted for more than of our net sales in we also market our standard products through our product catalog and web site 
our principal marketing tool for the scientific market is our comprehensive product catalog  the newport resource 
this catalog  numbering approximately  pages  provides detailed product information as well as extensive technical and applications data 
we publish this catalog in english  french  german and japanese  and mail it to approximately  existing and potential customers 
new product supplements are also distributed between publications 
our web site features an online catalog  providing customers with access to the latest information regarding our products  technical tutorial and application related materials  sales information  a literature and information request form  and the ability to purchase a majority of our standard products 
research and product development we continually seek to improve our technological leadership position through internal research  product development and licensing  and acquisitions of complementary technologies 
as of january   we had employees engaged in research and development 
we continually work to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce innovative new products to satisfy the needs of our customers 
in addition  we regularly investigate new ways to combine components manufactured by our various divisions to produce innovative technological solutions for the markets we serve 
total research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  in  million  or of net sales  in  and million  or of net sales  in research and development expenses attributable to our industrial and scientific technologies division were million  or of net sales to that segment  in  million  or of net sales to that segment  in  and million  or of net sales to that segment  in research and development expenses attributable to our advanced packaging and automation systems division were million  or of net sales to that segment  in  million  or of net sales to that segment  in  and million  or of net sales to that segment  in we are committed to product development and expect to continue our investment in this area in the current and future years 
we believe that the continual development or acquisition of innovative new products will be critical to our future success 
failure to develop  or introduce on a timely basis  new products or product enhancements that achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
customers we sell our products to a significant number of customers worldwide  in a wide range of diverse end markets  including semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging equipment  scientific research  aerospace and defense  life and health sciences and fiber optic communications 
we believe that our diversification in this area minimizes our dependence on any single industry or group of customers 
sales during to two customers of our advanced packaging and automation systems division totaled million and million  respectively  which represented and of our net sales to that segment for the year  respectively 
sales during to each of these customers represented less than of our consolidated net sales for the year 
sales during to one customer of our industrial and scientific technologies division  kla tencor corporation  totaled million  which represented of our net sales to that segment for the year  and of our consolidated net sales for the year 
we believe that our relationships with these customers 
table of contents are good 
however  if kla tencor corporation or any other key customer discontinues or reduces its relationship with us  or suffers downturns in its business  it could have a significant negative impact on our financial results on a short term basis  and our business and results of operations could be harmed going forward if we are unable to sufficiently expand our customer base to replace the lost business 
competition the markets for our products are intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology 
in our industrial and scientific technologies business  our primary competitors are currently aerotech inc  anorad corporation  danaher corporation and physik instrumente for our precision motion systems  kinetic systems  inc  melles griot  inc  and technical manufacturing corp 
for our vibration isolation products  cvi laser corporation  corning tropel corporation  linos photonics  melles griot  inc  new focus  inc  optosigma corporation  and thorlabs  inc 
for our precision optics and opto mechanical products  aoi sansho  exfo electro optical  inc  palomar technologies and suruga seiki co  ltd  for our assembly automation systems  and agilent technologies  inc  ando corporation  anritsu corporation  exfo electro optical inc  keithley instruments  inc  and moritex corporation for our test and measurement systems 
in the semiconductor market  for front end processing applications  our primary competitors are currently asyst technologies  inc  brooks automation  inc  genmark automation  inc  kawasaki heavy industries  ltd  and yaskawa electric corp 
for our wafer handling robots  and asyst technologies  inc  brooks automation  inc 
and tdk corporation for our load ports 
for semiconductor back end packaging applications  our primary competitors are datacon technology ag  esec  f k delvotech  and palomar technologies  for our automated assembly systems  and asymtek  cookson electronics  inc  and protec co  ltd 
for our dispensing systems 
in each of our businesses  we also face competition from certain of our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop their own systems  subsystems and components 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in our markets are product features and performance  quality  reliability and service support  customer relationships  ability to manufacture and deliver products on a timely basis  pricing  and ability to customize products to customer specifications 
we believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors 
however  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
we compete in various markets against a number of companies  some of which have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and significantly greater technical  financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  some of these companies have long established relationships with our customers and potential customers in our markets 
in addition to current competitors  we believe that new competitors  some of whom may have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than us  will seek to provide products to one or more of our markets in the future 
such future competition could harm our business 
intellectual property and proprietary rights our success and competitiveness depends to an extent on our technology and other intellectual property such as trade secrets  patents and trademarks 
we protect our technology by controlling access to our proprietary 
table of contents information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and our customers and partners  and  in some cases  through the use of patents  trademark registrations  and licenses 
we have been granted a number of patents in the us and foreign jurisdictions 
we also have trademarks registered in the us and foreign jurisdictions 
we actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate 
it is possible that  despite our efforts  other parties may use  obtain or try to copy our products and technology 
policing unauthorized use of our products and technology is difficult and time consuming 
we cannot guarantee that the steps we take to protect our rights will prevent any misappropriation of our products or technology 
this is particularly the case in foreign jurisdictions  where the intellectual property laws may not afford our intellectual property rights the same protection as the laws of the united states 
in addition  infringement  invalidity  right to use or ownership claims by third parties may be asserted against us in the future  which claims could materially harm our business  operating results or financial condition  regardless of the outcome 
manufacturing we assemble  test and package components and systems at domestic manufacturing facilities located in irvine  california  richmond  california  north billerica  massachusetts  and chandler  arizona  and at our international manufacturing facilities in beaune la rolande  france and brigueuil  france 
in addition  we subcontract the manufacture of various products and components to a number of third party subcontract manufacturers 
our manufacturing processes are diverse and consist of purchasing raw materials  principally stainless steel  aluminum and glass  processing the raw materials into components  subassemblies and finished products  purchasing components  assembling and testing components and subassemblies  and  for our larger products  assembling the subassemblies and components into integrated systems 
we primarily design and manufacture components internally  although on a limited basis  we purchase completed products from certain third party suppliers and resell those products through our distribution system 
most of these completed products are produced to our specifications and carry our name and logo 
we currently procure various components from single sources due to unique component designs as well as certain quality and performance requirements 
in addition  we manufacture certain components internally  and there are no readily available third party suppliers of these components 
if single sourced components were to become unavailable or were to become unavailable on terms satisfactory to us  we would be required to purchase comparable components from other sources 
while we believe that we would be able to obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  if we are unable to do so our business  results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have not incurred material expenses related to environmental compliance in past periods  and  due to the nature of our businesses  do not expect to incur such expenses in the future 
backlog our total consolidated backlog of orders totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december   million of our consolidated backlog was scheduled to be shipped on or before december  orders for many of the products we sell to the semiconductor equipment market  which comprise a significant portion of our sales  are often subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer  and we have from time to time experienced significant cancellations and pushouts of orders from these markets  which negatively affected our operating results in those periods 
in addition  because we manufacture a significant portion of our standard catalog products for inventory  we often make shipments of these products upon or within a short time period following receipt of an order 
as a result  our backlog of orders at any particular date may not be an accurate indicator of our sales for succeeding periods 

table of contents investments in addition to the ownership of subsidiaries detailed in exhibit to this annual report on form k  we from time to time make investments in companies involved in developing products and technologies related to our business  and we currently hold minority ownership interests in a number of small  privately held companies 
these investments are designed to further our strategic objectives and to support our key business initiatives 
we want to support growth in new technologies  particularly those related to our strategic markets  in order to create and expand markets for our products 
while financial returns are not our primary goal  our strategic investment program seeks to invest in companies that can succeed and have a positive impact on their markets 
during  we invested million to acquire of nexx systems  inc  a privately held developer and manufacturer of flip chip processing equipment located in billerica  massachusetts  to continue to expand our participation in the flip chip packaging market 
at december   the carrying value of our investments totaled million 
investments in technology companies involve significant risks  including the risks that such companies may be unable to raise additional required operating capital on acceptable terms or at all  or may not achieve or maintain market acceptance of their technology or products 
in the event that any of such risks occurs  the value of our investment could decline significantly 
in addition  because there is no public market for the securities we acquire  our ability to liquidate our investments is limited  and such markets may not develop in the future 
in  two fiber optic component manufacturers in which we had made minority investments in prior years experienced severe financial difficulties 
each manufacturer has shut down its business and liquidated its assets 
as a result  in we recorded an asset write down of million relating to these investments 
in the event that we are required to write down the carrying value of one or more of our investments in the future  our earnings could be materially and adversely affected 
employees as of january   we had employees worldwide 
none of our employees are represented by a union 
we believe that our relationships with our employees are good

the dtc acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
this discussion includes the effects of the acquisition of kli for all years presented and the effects of the acquisitions of mrsi and dtc from their dates of acquisition 
divestitures 
in march  to more efficiently deploy our resources to those areas that are critical to product development efforts for our strategic markets  our board of directors approved management s plan to sell our industrial metrology systems division imsd  including the business of cejohansson ab  a sweden based global supplier of advanced metrology systems that we acquired in december the sale of the imsd division was completed in in august  to increase the efficiency of our product development and manufacturing efforts  our board of directors approved management s plan to sell our operation in plymouth  minnesota  which manufactured high precision motion stages for the semiconductor equipment  computer peripheral  fiber optic communications and life and health sciences markets and was part of our industrial and scientific technologies division 
in the first quarter of  due to the weak response from potential buyers  we shut down the operation and liquidated the majority of the remaining assets 
both of these divestitures have been accounted for as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  
table of contents inventory reserves  warranty obligations  restructuring reserves  asset impairment valuations and income tax valuations 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue after all significant obligations have been met  collectibility is probable and title has passed  which typically occurs upon shipment or completion of services 
for products that require installation for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  we recognize revenue upon completion of installation 
for products that require installation where installation is not essential to functionality and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory we recognize revenue upon shipment with estimated installation costs accrued 
however  if a portion of the revenue is not payable until installation is complete  we defer revenue up to the amount that is not payable 
we defer revenues for training until the service is completed 
we recognize revenue for extended service contracts through the passage of time 
our customers generally have days from the original invoice date generally days for international customers to return a standard catalog product purchase for exchange or credit 
the catalog product must be returned in its original condition and meet certain other criteria 
product returns of catalog items have historically been insignificant and are charged against revenue in the period returned 
custom  option configured and certain other products as defined in the terms and conditions of sale cannot be returned 
accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by periodically reviewing invoices outstanding over a certain period of time 
we have recorded reserves for specific receivables deemed to be at risk for collection  as well as a general reserve based on our historical collections experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
in  we increased our reserves for uncollectible accounts due to generally weak macro economic conditions that have caused adverse changes in the financial condition of certain of our customers 
if the financial conditions of our customers in the markets we serve were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost determined on either a first in  first out fifo or average cost basis or market and provide reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare those requirements with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserves are established for inventory levels that exceed expected future demand 
we recorded significant reserves  primarily for excess inventory  in and due to deterioration in two of our primary target markets  fiber optic communications and semiconductor capital equipment 
it is possible that additional changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to changes in market conditions  which could adversely affect our operating results 
warranty 
unless otherwise stated in our product literature  we provide a one year warranty from the original invoice date on all product material and workmanship 
products sold to original equipment manufacturer oem customers generally carry longer warranties  typically to months 
defective products will be either repaired or replaced  generally at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and 
table of contents processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage and or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligation would be required which could adversely affect our operating results 
impairment of assets and restructuring reserves 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments  related primarily to the future profitability and or future value of the assets 
changes in our strategic plan and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technologies in areas within or adjacent to our strategic focus  all of which are privately held and whose values are difficult to determine 
we record an investment impairment charge in any reporting period where we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in  two fiber optic component manufacturers in which we had made minority investments in prior years experienced severe financial difficulties 
each manufacturer has shut down its business and liquidated its assets 
as a result  we recorded an asset write down of million in relating to these investments 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which we adopted on january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to impairment tests based upon a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units  as defined  and the carrying value of the reporting units net assets  including goodwill 
pursuant to sfas no 
 upon adoption we tested our goodwill for impairment and recorded an impairment charge  based upon an independent valuation  of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  sfas no 
requires a review for impairment at least annually or when circumstances exist that would indicate an impairment of such goodwill 
we perform the annual impairment review as of october st each year 
the and annual reviews resulted in no additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill 
at december   we had goodwill of approximately million 
during and  in response to the continued severe downturn in the fiber optic communications market and the uncertainty with respect to the pace of recovery in the semiconductor equipment market  our board of directors approved restructuring and cost reduction plans designed to bring our operating costs in line with our business outlook at those times 
as a result of these plans  we recorded significant reserves in and these reserves included estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and facility closure costs 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs to settle such liabilities may differ from the amounts estimated 
as a result of our restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance and related termination costs  million related to facility consolidations and million related to other activities 
in addition  we recorded charges of million related to closure and consolidation of facilities  and million related to consignment and demonstration inventory that we deemed to be obsolete or slow moving  both of which were included in selling  general and administrative expense for we also established additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of million  which were included in cost of sales 
in  we increased our estimate of the required reserve for facility consolidations by million to reflect settlements of our remaining lease obligations for certain leases as well as revised estimates of future sublease income 
this amount was reflected in restructuring and other charges for 
table of contents in  we recorded restructuring charges of million for employee severance and related costs  million related to facility consolidations and million related to other activities 
in addition  we established additional reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of million  which were included in cost of sales 
the actions were completed as of december   resulting in an excess restructuring reserve of million 
this amount was used to reduce the restructuring and asset impairment charges and the related accrued restructuring costs 
the following table summarizes the activity in the accrued restructuring costs employee severance facility consolidation other total in thousands restructuring and asset impairment charges cash payments non cash write offs accrued restructuring at december  restructuring and asset impairment charges cash payments non cash write offs reversal of excess reserves reclassifications accrued restructuring at december  restructuring and asset impairment charges cash payments reclassifications accrued restructuring at december  as of december   employees had been terminated under the restructuring plan  and all of the accrued employee severance had been paid 
the facility consolidation reserves will be paid over the associated lease terms  which expire at various dates between and at december  and  million and million  respectively  of accrued restructuring costs were expected to be paid within one year and are reflected in current liabilities  and million and million  respectively  of accrued restructuring costs were included in long term accrued restructuring costs and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year 
the income tax provision benefit is computed on the pretax income loss of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction based on current tax law 
deferred taxes result from the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between the recorded amounts of the assets and liabilities for tax and financial accounting purposes 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent we cannot determine  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas no 
 that the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
we recorded a valuation reserve in the third quarter of against our deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas no 
 due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
as such  we did not recognize any tax benefit on the losses recorded in and recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for the current period 
for the foreseeable future  the tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 

table of contents realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of future taxable income and or tax planning strategies  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and or tax planning strategies 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
fiscal year end 
effective beginning in the first quarter of  we are changing to a conventional week accounting fiscal year 
our fiscal year will end on the saturday closest to december  and our fiscal quarters will end on the saturday closest to the end of each corresponding calendar quarter 
as a result  for fiscal  our first  second and third quarters will end on april   july  and october   respectively  and our fiscal year will end on january  results of operations the following table represents the results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales percentage of net sales for the years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense restructuring  impairment and other charges acquisition and other non recurring charges operating loss interest and other income  net asset write down income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net loss net sales 
for  and  our net sales totaled million  million and million  respectively 
net sales for decreased million  or  compared with the decrease in net sales was principally attributable to reductions in sales to the semiconductor equipment and fiber optic communications markets  both of which experienced significant downturns from levels  as well as to reductions in sales to our other end markets due to generally weak macro economic conditions  offset in part by a slight increase in sales to the life and health sciences market 
net sales for decreased million  or  compared with this decrease in net sales resulted primarily from significant reductions in sales to the fiber optic communications and semiconductor equipment markets  offset in part by a slight increase in sales to the aerospace and research markets 
sales to the semiconductor equipment market were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
sales to this market in decreased million  or  compared with  and sales to this market in decreased million  or  compared with the declines in 
table of contents both periods reflect weakness in demand by semiconductor manufacturers for capital equipment  which led to a significant reduction in demand for the components  subsystems  robots and turnkey systems that we sell to this market 
the declines in and  compared with their respective prior year periods  were offset in part by the inclusion of sales from mrsi  which we acquired in february sales to our other markets  comprised primarily of research  aerospace and defense  life and health sciences and other end markets we serve were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
sales to these markets in decreased million  or  compared with sales to life and health sciences customers in were higher compared with  but this increase was offset by reductions in sales to other end markets due to weak overall macro economic conditions and a continued decline in sales to industrial customers supporting the telecommunications industry 
sales to these markets in decreased million  or  compared with sales to research and aerospace customers in were higher compared with  but this increase was offset by a significant reduction in sales to industrial customers supporting the telecommunications industry 
sales to the fiber optic communications market were million  million and million for  and  respectively

for  and  domestic sales were million  million and million  respectively 
domestic sales in decreased million  or  compared with  driven primarily by decreases in sales to the semiconductor equipment market  the fiber optic communications market and our other end markets due to the factors discussed above 
domestic sales to the semiconductor equipment market for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to this market in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with domestic sales to the fiber optic communications market for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to this market in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with domestic sales to our other end markets for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to these markets in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with international sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  international sales decreased million  or  due primarily to decreases in sales to the fiber optic communications market and our other end markets due to the factors discussed above 
the decrease was partially offset by favorable exchange rate changes and increases in sales to semiconductor back end packaging customers  although the impact of such factors on the sales to each geographic market varies based on the composition of our sales to that geographic market 
for  international sales decreased million  or  compared with  due primarily to decreases in the fiber optic communications market and our other end markets 
international sales to the semiconductor equipment market for were million  an increase of million  or compared with sales to this market in of million were flat compared with international sales to the fiber optic communications market for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to this market in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with international sales to our other end markets for were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to these markets in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with geographically  sales to european customers were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to these customers in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to pacific rim customers were million  an increase of million  or  compared with sales to these customers in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to canadian customers were million  an increase of million  or  
table of contents compared with sales to these customers in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to other international customers in were million  a decrease of million  or  compared with sales to these customers in were million  a decrease of million  or compared with the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
as the value of the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies  sales in those currencies convert to more us dollars  conversely  when the value of the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies  sales in those countries convert to fewer us dollars 
our net sales increased by million in compared with  and increased by million in compared with  due to reductions in the average value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies compared with the corresponding prior year periods 
our business is subject to risks arising from market conditions in the semiconductor equipment and fiber optic communications markets  as well as from general economic conditions 
the general softness in economic conditions has constrained capital spending in many of our end markets 
the semiconductor equipment market continues to be constrained by capital spending controls at most major manufacturers  though we have seen some increases in orders from customers in this market in recent quarters 
the downturn in the fiber optic communications market worsened throughout and remained depressed in  and we expect our orders from and sales to this market to remain depressed until at least the precise timing and extent of any recovery from these conditions in the semiconductor equipment and fiber optic communications markets is difficult to predict and represents a significant uncertainty with respect to our future operating results 
we expect that our sales to our other markets  comprised primarily of the research  aerospace and defense and life and health sciences markets will fluctuate from period to period in line with changes in overall research and defense spending levels  but will increase in future periods as we increase our penetration of these markets and the life and health sciences market in particular 
gross margin 
gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
gross margins for and included charges to cost of sales for increased inventory reserves of million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  respectively  as part of the and cost reduction plans discussed previously 
our overall gross margins in were negatively impacted by previously capitalized underabsorbed overhead costs 
products sold in were produced during periods in which substantial unabsorbed overhead costs were allocated to inventory 
these variances  which were caused primarily by lower sales volume and production activity  were capitalized when the inventory was produced and are charged to cost of sales when the related products are sold 
the negative effect of these capitalized variances was partially offset by the cost reduction actions that we implemented during the second half of and throughout  including facility consolidations and headcount reductions 
in addition to the increased inventory reserves charge of million  gross margins were also negatively impacted by underabsorbed overhead costs caused by significantly lower sales volume and lower fixed overhead absorption in  offset in part by lower sales to oem customers 
in the next several quarters  we expect our margins to be negatively impacted by the effect of unabsorbed overhead cost variances that were capitalized previously 
generally  we expect that our gross margin will fluctuate in future periods due to factors including absorption of fixed overhead due to sales volumes and production activity  product mix and the proportion of sales to oem customers  material costs  changes in the carrying value of inventory and manufacturing efficiencies 
in particular  because a significant portion of our manufacturing overhead is fixed in the short term  the impact of increases or decreases in sales on our gross margin will likely not be in proportion to the changes in net sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense totaled million  or of net sales  million  or of net sales and million  or of net sales for  and  respectively 
sg a expense for included expenses in the third quarter of million  or of net sales  for costs incurred in connection with our cost reduction initiatives 
sg a expense for included million of amortization of goodwill  which beginning in  is no longer required to be amortized  but instead 
table of contents is subject to periodic impairment testing  pursuant to sfas no 
the decrease in absolute dollars in compared with was attributable primarily to the impact of the significant cost reduction actions we have undertaken in the last months 
the benefits of these cost reduction actions were offset in part by the inclusion of a full year of sg a expense relating to mrsi  which we acquired in february  and for which there was not a full year of costs in  and by higher legal expenses incurred in to protect our intellectual property 
the decrease in expenses in compared with resulted from lower variable expenses related to the lower sales volume and from the benefits of our cost reduction measures  offset in part by the addition of sg a expenses relating to mrsi  for which there was no comparable expense in we expect that sg a as a percentage of sales will fluctuate in the future based on our sales level in any given period 
because a significant portion of our sg a expenses are fixed in the short term  these fluctuations will likely not be in proportion to the changes in net sales 
research and development r d expense 
r d expense totaled million  or of net sales  million  or of net sales and million  or of net sales for  and  respectively 
r d expense decreased million  or in compared with this decrease in r d expense was attributable primarily to reductions in r d spending in the fiber optic communications area  as well as our efforts to maximize the focus and efficiency of our r d efforts  offset in part by the inclusion of a full year of r d expenses associated with the operations of mrsi  for which there was not a full year of costs in r d expense declined million  or  in compared with due primarily to our efforts to maximize the focus and efficiency of our r d efforts  offset by additional r d spending related to mrsi  for which there was no comparable expense in we believe that the continued development and advancement of our key products and technologies is critical to our future success 
accordingly  we intend to continue to invest in key r d initiatives  while working to ensure that the efforts are focused and the funds are deployed efficiently 
we expect that r d expense as a percentage of sales will fluctuate in the future based on our sales level in any given period 
because of our commitment to continued product development  and because a significant portion of our r d expense are fixed in the short term  these fluctuations will likely not be in proportion to the changes in net sales 
restructuring  impairment and other charges 
restructuring  impairment and other charges totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively  of which  million  million and million related to the cost reduction and related initiatives discussed previously 
such charges in also included million of additional severance related to our cost reduction actions taken in that were not included in the original restructuring charge 
acquisition and other non recurring charges 
during the first quarter of  we recorded acquisition and other non recurring charges of million 
these charges were comprised of million for investment banking  legal and accounting fees related to our acquisition of kli and a charge of million related to the acceleration of stock options held by a retiring executive officer 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in from was due primarily to lower interest earned due to lower yields on cash and marketable securities 
the decrease in from was due primarily to lower interest earned due to lower yields on cash and marketable securities  as well as lower interest expense due to lower outstanding debt in we expect that net interest and other income will fluctuate in future periods based on cash balances  changes in interest rates and the timing of sales of marketable securities 
asset write down 
two fiber optic component manufacturers in which we had made minority investments in prior years experienced severe financial difficulties during each manufacturer has shut down its operations and liquidated its assets 
as a result  we wrote down these investments to their estimated fair value  resulting in a charge of million during 
table of contents income taxes 
our effective tax rates from continuing operations were  and for  and  respectively 
in  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  compared with a million income tax expense in the income tax benefit in was attributable to federal income tax refunds and refundable foreign income tax incentives related to research and development  and to the favorable settlement of various irs examinations 
the income tax expense in resulted from a valuation allowance that was recorded against a portion of our deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas no 
 due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
as such  we did not recognize any tax benefit on the losses recorded in the current periods 
for the foreseeable future  the tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in our operating activities of million in was primarily attributable to the cash portion of our net loss  cash payments for accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million  cash payments for accrued restructuring costs of million  and an increase in accounts receivable of million  offset in part by a decrease in inventory of million  a decrease in other current assets of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million in was attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of million  purchases of equity investments and intellectual property of million  and net purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
net cash used in financing activities of million in was attributable to the repayment of long term debt of million  which includes the early repayment of the outstanding principal balance of million owed on our senior notes  and repurchases of our common stock of million  offset in part by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and purchase plans of million  and proceeds of million related to a sale leaseback facility refinancing 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable securities of million 
substantially all of our marketable securities are divided into two portfolios  each managed by a professional investment management firm  under the oversight of our senior financial management team and the investment committee of our board of directors 
such portfolio managers invest the funds allocated to them in accordance with our investment policy  which is reviewed regularly by our senior financial management and the investment committee 
we expect that our portfolio balances will fluctuate in the future based on factors such as cash used in or provided by ongoing operations  acquisitions or divestitures  investments in other companies  share repurchases  capital expenditures and contractual obligations  as well as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
at december   we had in place a million revolving line of credit expiring december  certain of the marketable securities that are being managed by the lending institution collateralize the line of credit 
the line bears interest at the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate at december  plus  at our option  plus an unused line fee of per year 
at december   there were no balances outstanding under the line of credit  with million available under the line  after considering outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
in  we purchased a minority interest in nexx systems  inc  a privately held developer of flip chip processing equipment for back end semiconductor manufacturing applications  for million 
the investment is made up of a million common stock component and a million preferred stock component 
both amounts are reflected in investments and other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
we are accounting for this investment using the cost method of accounting 

table of contents in april  we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to purchase up to million shares  or of our then outstanding stock 
the purchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  and the timing and amount of the purchases will be based on factors including our share price  cash balances  expected cash requirements and general business and market conditions 
during  we repurchased  shares at a cost of million 
we lease certain of our manufacturing and office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
as of december   we had no material purchase obligations  no long term debt and no long term obligations  other than obligations under capital and operating leases 
our capital and operating lease obligations at december  are summarized as follows capital leases operating leases total obligations in thousands payments due by period thereafter total minimum lease payments less amount representing interest present value of net minimum capital lease payments we believe our current working capital position  together with our expected future cash flows from operations and our existing credit availability  will be adequate to fund operations in the ordinary course of business  anticipated capital expenditures  anticipated repurchases of common stock  debt payment requirements and other contractual obligations  for the foreseeable future 
however  this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks see risks relating to our business  on pages  and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future 
we have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies or any material capital expenditures 
however  we continue to evaluate acquisitions of and or investments in products  technologies  capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions and or investments in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions and or investments 
new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb modified fin to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen 
fin provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
in general  a vie is a corporation  partnership  limited liability corporation  trust  or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support  has a 
table of contents group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities  or has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 
fin requires a vie to be consolidated if a party with an ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the vie a variable interest holder is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns if no party absorbs a majority of the vie s losses  or both 
a variable interest holder that consolidates the vie is called the primary beneficiary 
upon consolidation  the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all of the vie s assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the vie as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest 
fin also requires disclosures about vies that the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
fin was effective immediately for vies created after january  we adopted the provisions of fin  as revised  as of december  we do not have any vies that would be required to be consolidated or disclosed 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf provides guidance on how to account for certain arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  which provides guidance on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the sec 
sab revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance that was previously issued in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab that was issued in december in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
the adoption of sab did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risks relating to our business the following is a summary of certain risks we face in our business 
they are not the only risks we face 
additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks  and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in assessing these risks  investors should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our operating results are difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors and or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock will likely decline significantly 
our operating results in any given quarter have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate 
these fluctuations are typically unpredictable and can result from numerous factors including fluctuations in our customers capital spending  industry cyclicality and other economic conditions within the markets we serve  demand for our products and the products sold by our customers  the level of orders within a given quarter and preceding quarters  the timing and level of cancellations and delays of orders for our products  the timing of product shipments within a given quarter  
table of contents our timing in introducing new products  variations in the mix of products we sell in each of the markets in which we do business  changes in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  market acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of our products  the availability and cost of key components and raw materials we use to manufacture our products  our ability to manufacture a sufficient quantity of our products to meet customer demand  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  timing of new product introductions by our competitors  and our levels of expenses 
we may in the future choose to change prices  increase spending  or add or eliminate products in response to actions by competitors or in an effort to pursue new market opportunities 
these actions may also adversely affect our business and operating results and may cause our quarterly results to be lower than the results of previous quarters 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results from operations  or any other similar period to period comparisons  should not be construed as reliable indicators of our future performance 
in any period  our results may be below the expectations of market analysts and investors  which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to drop 
we are highly dependent on the semiconductor equipment industry  which is volatile and unpredictable 
a substantial portion of our current and expected future business comes from sales of subsystem products to manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication and metrology equipment and sales of capital equipment to integrated semiconductor device manufacturers 
the semiconductor market has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the timing  severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict  and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles 
the continuing uncertainty in this market severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in this market 
during industry downturns  our revenues from this market will decline suddenly and significantly 
our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next generation product technology and to support and service our products 
in addition  due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to this market  we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell 
accordingly  downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results 
conversely  when upturns in this market occur  we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid  and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales to the semiconductor market  and we are highly dependent on the success of their products 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market 
our top five customers in this market comprised approximately  and of our sales to this market for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively  and our top two customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our sales to this market in these periods 
in  one customer in this market  kla tencor corporation  comprised of our consolidated net sales for the year 
in the back end packaging portion of this market  two customers constituted 
table of contents substantially all of our sales to this portion during if any of our principal customers discontinues its relationship with us  replaces us as a vendor for certain products or suffers downturns in its business  our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
in addition  because a relatively small number of companies dominate the front end equipment and back end packaging portions of this market  and because those companies rarely change vendors in the middle of a product s life cycle  it may be particularly difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business 
the semiconductor capital equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions  changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
because our customers face uncertainties with regard to the growth and requirements of these markets  their products and components may not achieve  or continue to achieve  anticipated levels of market acceptance 
if our customers are unable to deliver products that gain market acceptance  it is likely that these customers will not purchase our products or will purchase smaller quantities of our products 
we often invest substantial resources in developing our systems and subsystems in advance of significant sales of these systems and or subsystems to such customers 
a failure on the part of our subsystem customers products to gain market acceptance  or a failure of the semiconductor capital equipment market to grow would have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations 
our future growth is dependent on the growth of mm semiconductor wafer processes and flip chip packaging 
a significant portion of our expected future subsystem business in the semiconductor capital equipment market is comprised of products for the fabrication of mm semiconductor wafers 
wafer fabrication equipment for mm wafers is in an early stage of its adoption  and is expected to be driven by the need for the ability to manufacture more semiconductor chips at lower cost 
the deployment of such equipment requires a significant capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers  and many semiconductor manufacturers have delayed plans to deploy such equipment until market conditions improve 
in addition  recently certain industry analysts have forecasted more conservative capital equipment spending and slower adoption of new technologies by semiconductor manufacturers in future periods 
if the demand for capital equipment for mm wafers does not increase  or increases more slowly than expected  demand for our subsystem products will likewise be adversely affected  and our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
in addition  a significant portion of our expected future capital equipment sales to the integrated semiconductor device manufacturing market is comprised of systems for flip chip bonding and other advanced die bonding techniques 
demand for these systems is expected to be driven in significant part by increases in demand for new technologies in industries such as communications and consumer electronics that require the use of such manufacturing techniques 
if the demand for electronic devices requiring flip chip bonding and or other advanced die bonding techniques does not increase  or increases more slowly than expected  demand for our capital equipment will likewise be adversely affected  and our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
many of the markets and industries that we serve are subject to rapid technological change  and if we do not introduce new and innovative products or improve our existing products  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
many of our markets are characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  shifting customer needs and new product introductions and enhancements 
products in our markets often become outdated quickly and without warning 
we depend to a significant extent upon our ability to enhance our existing products  to anticipate and address the demands of the marketplace for new and improved technology  either through internal development or by acquisitions  and to be price competitive 
if we or our competitors introduce new or enhanced products  it may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
in addition  because certain of our markets experience severe cyclicality in capital spending  if we fail to introduce 
table of contents new products in a timely manner we may miss market upturns  and may fail to have our subsystem products designed into our customers products 
we may not be successful in acquiring  developing  manufacturing or marketing new products on a timely or cost effective basis 
if we fail to adequately introduce new  competitive products on a timely basis  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we offer products for multiple industries and must face the challenges of supporting the distinct needs of each of the markets we serve 
we market products for the semiconductor capital equipment  scientific research  aerospace and defense  life and health sciences and fiber optic communications markets 
because we operate in multiple markets  we must work constantly to understand the needs  standards and technical requirements of several different industries and must devote significant resources to developing different products for these industries 
product development is costly and time consuming 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  manufacture and test their own products 
as a result  we must anticipate trends in our customers industries and develop products before our customers products are commercialized 
if we do not accurately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest substantial resources in developing products that do not achieve broad market acceptance 
our decision to continue to offer products to a given market or to penetrate new markets is based in part on our judgment of the size  growth rate and other factors that contribute to the attractiveness of a particular market 
if our product offerings in any particular market are not competitive or our analyses of a market are incorrect  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
because the sales cycle for some of our products is long and difficult to predict  and certain of our orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results 
many of our capital equipment and subsystem products are complex  and customers for these products require substantial time to make purchase decisions 
these customers often perform  or require us to perform extensive configuration  testing and evaluation of our products before committing to purchasing them 
the sales cycle for our capital equipment and subsystem products from initial contact through shipment typically varies  is difficult to predict and can last as long as one year 
the orders comprising our backlog are often subject to cancellation and changes in delivery schedules by our customers without significant penalty 
we have from time to time experienced order rescheduling and cancellations that have caused our revenues in a given period to be materially less than would have been expected based on our backlog at the beginning of the period 
if we experience such rescheduling and or cancellations in the future  our operating results will fluctuate from period to period 
these fluctuations could harm our results of operations and cause our stock price to drop 
we face significant risks from doing business in foreign countries 
our business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
for the years ended december   and  our international revenues accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total net sales  with a substantial portion of sales originating in europe 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net sales for the foreseeable future 
as a result of our international operations  we face various risks  which include adverse changes in the political or economic conditions in countries or regions where we manufacture or sell our products  challenges of administering our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements including export requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection periods  overlapping  differing or more burdensome tax structures  
table of contents adverse currency fluctuations  differing protection of intellectual property  difficulties in staffing and managing each of our individual foreign operations  increased risk of exposure to terrorist activities  and trade restrictions and licensing requirements 
as a result of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could affect the sales price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets  potentially making our products less competitive 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations could increase the costs and expenses of our foreign operations or require us to modify our current business practices 
if we experience any of the risks associated with international business  our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we face substantial competition  and if we fail to compete effectively  our operating results will suffer 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we believe that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future 
we compete in several specialized markets  against a limited number of companies in each market 
we also face competition in some of our markets from our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop products that are competitive to ours  or who engage subcontract manufacturers to manufacture oem subassembly products on their behalf 
many of our existing and potential competitors are more established  enjoy greater name recognition and possess greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
other competitors are small and highly specialized firms that are able to focus on only one aspect of a market 
we compete on the basis of product features  quality  reliability and price and on our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures may force us to reduce our prices  which could negatively affect our operating results 
if we do not respond adequately to competitive challenges  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
acquisitions of additional businesses  products or technologies we may make could negatively affect our business 
we have in the past  and expect in the future  to achieve growth through a combination of internally developed new products and acquisitions 
in recent years we have acquired several companies and technologies  and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies  technologies and complementary product lines in the future to expand our product offerings and technology base to further our strategic goals 
each of our recent acquisitions involves  and any future acquisition would involve risks  including a decline in demand by our customers for the products of the acquired business  our ability to integrate the acquired business operations  products and personnel  our ability to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  our ability to manufacture and sell the products of the acquired businesses  our ability to expand our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to integrate and manage the acquired businesses  our ability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition  diversion of management s time and attention  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the products or services of an acquired firm  assumption of unknown liabilities  or other unanticipated events or circumstances  and 
table of contents the need to record significant charges or write down the carrying value of intangible assets  which could lower our earnings 
we cannot guarantee that any business that we may acquire will achieve the anticipated revenues and operating results 
we have in the past and may in the future choose to close or divest certain acquired companies  which could require us to record losses relating to such closures or divestitures 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are delayed in introducing our new products into the marketplace  or if our new products contain defects  our operating results will suffer 
because certain of our products are sophisticated and complex  we may experience delays in introducing new products or enhancements to our existing products 
if we do not introduce our new products or enhancements into the marketplace in a timely fashion  our customers may choose to use competitors products 
in addition  because certain of our markets  such as the semiconductor equipment market  are highly cyclical in nature  if we fail to timely introduce new products in advance of an upturn in the market s cycle  we may be foreclosed from selling products to many customers until the next cycle 
as such  our inability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
in addition  our products may contain defects or undetected errors 
as a result  we could incur substantial expenses in fixing any defects or undetected errors  which could result in damage to our competitive position and harm our business and results of operations 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  we may lose our competitive advantage 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the patent and trademark law and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our patents  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our rights granted under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us  and the claims under our patent applications may not be allowed 
we have in the past and may in the future be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications 
moreover  our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors  which claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel 
for example  we have notified several manufacturers of semiconductor wafer handling robots and load ports that we believe that they are infringing upon certain of our us patents  and may institute litigation against one or more of such companies in the future 
we will take such actions where we believe that they are of sufficient strategic or economic importance to us to justify the cost 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  intellectual property infringement claims 
we have from time to time received communications from third parties alleging that we are infringing certain trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights held by them 
whenever such claims arise  we evaluate their merits 
any claims of infringement brought by third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation  and we could become subject to damages for infringement  or to an injunction preventing us from 
table of contents selling one or more of our products or using one or more of our trademarks 
such claims could also result in the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the terms of our customer contracts typically require us to indemnify the customer in the event of any claim of infringement brought by a third party based on our products 
any such claims of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our ability to maintain and grow our business is directly related to the service of our employees in each area of our operations 
our future performance will be directly tied to our ability to hire  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for personnel in the technology marketplace is intense  and if we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of employees with the experience and skills we need or to retain our employees  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we rely on several sole source and limited source suppliers 
we obtain some of the materials used to build our systems and subsystems  such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables  from single or limited sources due to unique component designs as well as specialized quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products 
if our components or raw materials are unavailable in adequate amounts or are unavailable on satisfactory terms  we may be required to purchase them from alternative sources  if available  which could increase our costs and cause delays in the production and distribution of our products 
if we do not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
many of our suppliers require long lead times to deliver the quantities of components that we need 
if we fail to accurately forecast our needs  or if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of components that we use to manufacture our products  then delays or reductions in production and shipment could occur  which would harm our business and results of operations 
terrorism and acts of war and the associated economic uncertainties may negatively impact our business 
terrorist attacks and military activities have created economic and political uncertainties  contributing to the recent global economic downturn 
future acts of terrorism or military action may create additional uncertainties and worsen or delay recovery of the global economy  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
natural disasters could disrupt or shut down our operations 
our operations are susceptible to damages from earthquakes  floods  fire  loss of power or water supplies  or other similar contingencies 
we have significant facilities in areas with above average seismic activity 
if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility  any of which would harm our business 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are foreign exchange rates which may generate translation and transaction gains and losses and interest rate risk 

table of contents foreign currency risk operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates which can sometimes be volatile 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
from time to time we use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business  primarily foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange us dollars for foreign currencies at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts aa or a rated banks do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for any currency related fluctuations 
transaction gains and losses are included in our current net loss in our statement of operations 
net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our reported results of operations for the last three years 
our operating loss from international operations totaled million and million in and  respectively  and we had operating income from international operations of million in as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of international operations into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating future international operating profit include the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and taiwan dollar 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have had a material effect on reported net loss for the year ended december  we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
interest rate risk the interest rates we pay on certain of our debt instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
our collateralized line of credit bears interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate plus  at our option 
our investments in marketable securities  which totaled million at december   are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we estimate that a decline in the interest rate earned on our investment portfolio would have had resulted in a decline in our net income of million in the sensitivity analyses described in the interest rate and foreign exchange discussions above disregard the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa
