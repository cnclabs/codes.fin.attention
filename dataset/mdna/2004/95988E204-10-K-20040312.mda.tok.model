item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
continue to consolidate wireless licenses that are contiguous with our existing markets  including possible trades  acquisitions or dispositions it is part of our ongoing strategy to evaluate business opportunities including potential trades  acquisitions and dispositions to better consolidate our footprint 
in  we sold our non contiguous arizona market and acquired the contiguous cellular and pcs licenses and operations of minnesota southern wireless 
the licenses acquired along with the operations of minnesota southern wireless include the minnesota rsa mn and the minneapolis st 
paul metro a msa cellular licenses  as well as the mankato fairmont and rochester austin albert lea basic trading area bta pcs licenses 
markets and systems we operate cellular systems in rsas and msas 
inherent attributes of rsas and small msas make such markets attractive 
such attributes typically include relative under penetration as compared to more urban areas population bases of customers with substantial needs for communications services the ability to receive usf support in certain rural  insular and high cost areas the ability to cover large geographic areas with fewer cell sites as compared to urban areas less intense competitive environments less vulnerability to pcs and other competition 
table of contents large distances between population centers resulting in a higher proportion of roaming revenues than in urban areas in addition to our cellular licenses  we have also acquired certain pcs licenses 
we believe that there are inherent advantages to acquiring and owning such pcs licenses which include the ability to supplement our coverage and reduce incollect costs with our roaming partners the ability to expand our roaming offerings to mhz band pcs carriers leveraging our existing infrastructure  which enables us to offer roaming services at competitive rates that create a disincentive for our competitors to build their own pcs systems in our markets in many cases  our pcs licenses overlap populations already covered by our cellular licenses 
however  in some cases  our pcs licenses also have incremental population outside of our cellular license coverage areas 
as a result  the total licensed population of  noted at the end of the table below  includes of our cellular licenses  plus the incremental population covered by our pcs licenses 
the following table sets forth the populations covered by our cellular and pcs licenses 
the population data is estimated for based upon claritas  inc  claritas estimates  and is adjusted by us by applying claritas positive and negative growth factors

marketing  sales and customer service our sales and marketing strategy is designed to generate continued net subscriber growth and increased subscriber revenues  while maintaining and enhancing our cellularone and western wireless brands 
we target a customer base we believe is likely to generate higher monthly service revenues  while attempting to achieve a low cost of adding new subscribers 
marketing we market our products and services under the names cellularone  the first national brand name in the cellular industry  and western wireless  both of which we own 
we also license the cellularone name to other wireless communications providers 
the regional and national advertising 
table of contents campaigns developed by the cellular one group have enhanced our advertising exposure at a lower cost than what could be achieved independently 
the mission of the cellularone advertising program is to focus on promoting the cellularone brand for the direct benefit of ourselves and other cellularone licensees 
we utilize a national advertising agency which allows all of our creative and media buying efforts to be consolidated and managed centrally 
centralizing our creative and media buying efforts has allowed us to bring more consistency  focus and relevance to the cellularone brand marketing efforts 
in  we rolled out a new program in all our markets that capitalized on the cellularone brand identity and included advertising  retail operations  customer communications  a web site  pricing  promotions  products and services 
sales and distribution we sell our products and services through a combination of direct and indirect channels 
we operate both stores and kiosks under the cellularone and western wireless brand names and utilize a direct sales force trained to educate new customers on the features of our products 
sales commissions generally are linked both to subscriber revenue and subscriber retention  as well as activation levels 
we also are a retailer of handsets and maintain inventories of handsets 
we believe that our local retail locations provide the physical presence in local markets necessary to position cellularone and western wireless as quality local service providers and give us greater control over both our costs and the sales process 
in recent years we have focused on expanding our indirect network of national and local merchants and specialty retailers in order to reduce our fixed sales and marketing costs 
during  approximately of our gross customer additions were through our indirect channel 
we will continue to use a combination of direct and indirect sales channels  with the mix depending on the requirements of each particular market 
customer service providing high quality customer service is a significant element of our operating philosophy 
we are committed to attracting and retaining subscribers by providing consistently superior customer service 
we currently operate call centers in manhattan  kansas and issaquah  washington 
our call centers maintain highly sophisticated monitoring and control systems and well trained customer service and technical staffs to handle both routine and complex questions as they arise  hours a day  days a year 
we utilize credit check procedures at the time of sale and continuously monitor customer churn the rate of subscriber attrition and other events such as service agreement expiration dates  which can impact customer churn 
it is our belief that we can effectively manage customer churn through an outreach program staffed by our sales force and customer service personnel and through our efforts to predict more accurately the timing of potential customer churn 
the outreach program is intended to not only enhance subscriber loyalty  but also to increase add on sales and customer referrals 
this program allows the sales staff to check customer satisfaction  as well as to offer additional calling features  such as voice mail  call waiting and call forwarding 
competition competition for subscribers among wireless communications providers is based principally upon the services and features offered  the technical quality of the wireless system  customer service  system coverage  capacity and price 
under current fcc rules  there may be up to six pcs licensees in each geographic area in addition to the two existing cellular licensees 
also  specialized mobile radio smr dispatch system operators have constructed digital mobile communications systems  referred to as enhanced specialized mobile radio esmr  in many cities throughout the united states  including some of the markets in which we operate 
due to the high cost of construction  we do not believe pcs systems will be built in most of our rsas in the near future 
although we believe there are competitive advantages to operating in rural markets  we do operate in a competitive environment 
each of our cellular markets face one cellular competitor  such as verizon  alltel corporation alltel or cingular 
additionally  we have pcs and esmr competitors in most of our msas 
continuing industry consolidation has resulted in an increased presence of regional and national wireless operators within our service areas 
more recently  some national wireless operators have begun to build small 
table of contents networks in certain of the more densely populated or well traveled portions of our service areas 
the use of national advertising and promotional programs by national wireless operators run in our markets is a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures even though these operators may not provide service in these markets 
we also compete with wireless internet  paging  dispatch services  resellers and land line telephone service providers in some of our service areas 
increasingly  cellular service is becoming a viable alternative to land line voice services for certain customer segments  putting cellular licensees in direct competition with traditional land line telephone service providers 
one or two way paging services that feature voice messaging and data display  as well as tone only service  may be adequate for potential subscribers who do not need to speak to the caller 
potential users of cellular systems may find their communications needs satisfied by other current and developing technologies 
in the future  we expect to face increased competition from entities providing similar services using other communications technologies 
in addition  the auctioning and subsequent deployment of technology utilizing additional spectrum and the disaggregation of spectrum could also generate new competition for us 
while some of these technologies and services are currently operational  others are being developed or may be developed in the future 
continuing technological advances in the communications field make it difficult to predict the nature and extent of additional future competition 
suppliers and equipment vendors we do not manufacture any of the handsets  cell site or switching equipment used in our operations 
the high degree of compatibility among different manufacturers models of handsets  cell site and switching equipment allows us to design  supply and operate our systems without being dependent upon any single source of such equipment 
the handsets and cell site equipment used in our operations are available for purchase from multiple sources 
we currently offer handsets manufactured by audiovox  inc  kyocera wireless corp  motorola  inc 
and nokia telecommunications  inc and purchase cell site and switching equipment primarily from lucent technologies and nortel networks  inc intellectual property cellularone is a service mark registered with the united states patent and trademark office and owned by us 
we hold a federal trademark registration of the mark western wireless and have registered or applied for various other trade and service marks with the united states patent and trademark office  including the stylized hello  our tagline  proud to be the next best way to say hello  the hellofun  hellopix  helloweb  hellotxt service marks and the opendoor service mark for wireless data 
regulatory environment the fcc regulates the licensing  construction  operation  acquisition  sale and resale of cellular systems in the united states  pursuant to the communications act of  as amended the communications act  and the rules  regulations and policies promulgated by the fcc thereunder 
fcc regulations distinguish  in part  between cellular licenses which are for the mhz band  and pcs licenses  which are for the mhz band 
the communications act preempts state and local regulation of the entry of  or the rates charged by  any provider of commercial mobile radio service cmrs  such as a cellular service provider 
state governments  however  can regulate certain other terms and conditions of cellular service offerings and some states have imposed or are considering the imposition of consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry 
licensing of wireless communications systems a cellular communications system operates under a license granted by the fcc for a particular market or geographic area on one of two mhz band blocks allocated for cellular radio service 
cellular authorizations are issued for a year license term beginning on the date of the initial notification to the fcc of the completion of construction by a cellular carrier 

table of contents at the end of the year initial term for cellular licenses  licensees must file applications for renewal of licenses 
the fcc has adopted specific standards governing cellular license renewals 
under these standards  a cellular license will generally be renewed for additional year terms if a cellular licensee has provided substantial service during its past license term and has substantially complied with applicable fcc rules and policies and the communications act 
the communications act and fcc rules require the fcc s prior approval of any assignments of cellular licenses  including construction permits  or transfers of control of cellular licensees 
non controlling interests in an entity that holds a cellular license generally may be bought or sold without prior fcc approval 
if the transaction is over a certain size  any acquisition or sale of cellular interests may also require the prior approval of the federal trade commission and the department of justice as well as approval from any state or local regulatory authorities having competent jurisdiction 
as of january   there was no longer a limit on the amount of cmrs spectrum ie cellular  pcs  and smr that a carrier can hold in a market 
however  there remains a cellular cross interest rule that prohibits a carrier from owning an attributable interest in both cellular licenses in a single rsa market 
although the fcc retained the cellular cross interest rule in rsas  it will consider waivers of the rule for rsas that exhibit market conditions under which cellular cross interest may be permissible without significant likelihood of substantial competitive harm 
notwithstanding the removal of the spectrum cap and partial removal of the cross interest restriction  the fcc has indicated that it will engage in a case by case review of any anticompetitive effects of cmrs spectrum acquisitions  although it is not clear what criteria the fcc will use in such review 
regulatory developments e service the fcc has adopted rules governing the provision of emergency services by cellular  pcs and other mobile service providers  including enhanced e services that provide the caller s telephone number  location  and other useful information 
cellular and pcs providers must be able to process and transmit calls without call validation  including those from callers with speech or hearing disabilities 
under phase i of the fcc s e rules  if a public service answering point psap requests and is capable of processing the caller s telephone number and location information  then cellular  pcs  and other mobile service providers must relay a caller s automatic number identification and the location of the cell site or base station receiving a call 
wireless carriers must transmit all calls without regard to validation procedures intended to identify and intercept calls from non subscribers 
the fcc s rules require that analog cellular phones include a separate capability for processing calls that permit these calls to be handled  where necessary  by either cellular carrier in the area 
this rule applies only to new analog cellular handsets and not to existing handsets or to pcs or smr services 
the company has implemented phase i e service in several counties and is in the process of deploying phase i e service in accordance with the applicable fcc rules in areas where it has received a request for service 
under phase ii of the fcc s e rules  cmrs carriers are allowed to choose a handset based or network based approach for identifying the location of an e caller 
in areas where we have received valid requests for phase ii service  we are implementing a handset based approach which requires that the psap be able to identify the location of a caller within meters for of all calls and within meters for of all calls 
by order of the fcc  we were required to i begin selling and activating handsets with automatic location identification capability by march   ii by may   of new handset activations must be phase ii compliant  iii by november   of new handset activations must be phase ii compliant  and iv by may   of new digital handset activations must be phase ii compliant 
in addition  by december   of all subscriber handsets must be phase ii compliant 
under the fcc rules  carriers must begin providing phase ii service within six months of the latter of receiving a valid request for service from a psap or march  the company has implemented phase ii e service in the few counties that have requested this e service and is in the process of deploying phase ii service in accordance with the applicable fcc rules in other counties 

table of contents universal service in its implementation of the communications act  the fcc established new federal universal service rules under which wireless service providers are eligible  for the first time  to receive universal service support  and are also required to contribute to both federal and state usfs 
the fcc established universal service contribution factor is assessed against a carrier s interstate and international telecommunications revenues 
this contribution factor is subject to quarterly review and possible revision 
in an effort to maintain sufficient funding  the fcc adopted interim rules for determining the amount of interstate and international telecommunication revenues subject to the federal universal service contribution factor for wireless carriers 
under these new rules  wireless carriers can either use a proxy percentage provided by the fcc to determine the amount of the carrier s total subscriber revenue subject to the universal service contribution factor or calculate the amount of actual subscriber revenue which is interstate or international 
under the fcc rules  a wireless service provider may receive universal service support for providing telephone service in rural high cost areas  provided that the wireless service provider has been designated as an etc by a state commission or the fcc 
some states have conditioned etc status on the service provider meeting certain consumer protection and service quality requirements 
many states have also established state usf programs that require all telecommunications carriers  including cmrs carriers  to contribute to the fund 
under some of these state usfs  cmrs carriers are also eligible to receive universal service support 
both federal and state usfs are subject to change based upon pending regulatory proceedings  court challenges and marketplace conditions 
local number portability the fcc has adopted rules on telephone number portability and number pooling in an effort to achieve more efficient number utilization 
these rules apply to both land line and wireless carriers 
the fcc established november  as the extended deadline for cmrs carriers to implement service provider number portability in the top msas 
for markets outside of the top msas  the number portability requirement is triggered only upon receipt of a request by another carrier to implement number portability 
in such cases  carriers have six months to comply with these requests  but are not required to comply prior to may of the number portability requirements are subject to change based upon regulatory proceedings and court challenges 
number pooling wireless carriers are also subject to requirements governing number pooling  which provides for more efficient assignment and use of available numbers 
the fcc has imposed what is referred to as thousand block pooling  meaning carriers may only request and will only be assigned numbers in blocks of one thousand numbers rather than the previous blocks of ten thousand numbers 
the number pooling requirements apply only to carriers operating within the top msas  as described above 
employees and labor relations we consider our labor relations to be good and none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
as of december   we employed domestically a total of  people in the following areas number of category employees sales and marketing engineering general and administrative  including customer service the business of wwi overview wwi  through its consolidated subsidiaries and other operating companies  is a provider of mobile communications services in slovenia  austria  ireland  bolivia  ghana  haiti and georgia 
at december   the company owned approximately of wwi 
the balance is owned by the president of wwi who is also an executive vice president of the company 

table of contents the primary business of wwi is the delivery of mobile telecommunications services in markets outside of the united states 
in certain markets  wwi s operating companies also provide other telecommunications services  including fixed line services  wireless local loop and international long distance 
wwi s largest non mobile business is its fixed line operations in austria 
in  of wwi s consolidated service revenues were generated by its european subsidiaries in ireland and austria 
substantially all of these service revenues were from mobile telecommunications and were denominated in euros 
in june of  wwi sold its minority interest in its croatian joint venture  vip net gsm doo vip net 
in the third quarter of  operations were suspended in our minority owned operating company in c te d ivoire and we believe it is unlikely that we will be able to resume operations there 
international business and strategy wwi s strategy is to build a portfolio of wireless operations in which wwi has significant management responsibility  to support the growth and profitability of those operations and to opportunistically exit them as individual businesses mature and appropriate valuations can be realized 
we believe the key elements in executing this strategy are low acquisition costs potential for rapid growth an ability to partially fund operations by securing debt financing wwi provides management expertise to all of its operating companies  particularly in the early stages of development  and it exercises significant control over management decisions in all of its consolidated markets 
most of wwi s investment has been in european countries with highly developed telecommunications infrastructure and substantial wireless competition 
wwi has sought investment opportunities in these types of markets where the entry costs are sufficiently low and the growth potential is sufficient to present an attractive investment opportunity 
these markets generally have wireless penetration rates above and include austria and ireland 
wwi also invests in and operates in markets characterized by a substantial unmet demand for communications services offering the potential for rapid subscriber growth 
these markets include bolivia  haiti  ghana and georgia 
these markets are often characterized by inadequate local land line telephone service which is unavailable to the majority of the population 
wwi believes that wireless technology is a more economic medium to deliver telecommunications services in these markets 
by introducing competition and providing customers with a high quality alternative  wwi has succeeded in expanding the size and service offerings of the telecommunications sector in these markets 
these markets tend to have less competition in the wireless sector and generally have wireless penetration rates below 
markets and operations each of wwi s operating companies operate cellular communications systems over radio frequencies licensed by the telecommunications regulatory body of its respective country 
each of wwi s operating companies that provide wireless mobile services utilize gsm technology operating at the mhz band  mhz band or mhz band  with the exception of wwi s operating company in haiti  which utilizes tdma technology at the mhz band 
gsm is the most widely used wireless technology in the world  serving over billion customers 
gsm offers an open system architecture  is supported by a variety of vendors and allows operators to achieve cost economies in infrastructure and mobile terminal equipment 
gsm also provides the benefit of a single phone number and transparent services on a global roaming basis

fixed line services wwi s austrian operating company offers fixed communication services consisting of call by call or preselect for residential customers and directly connected and leased line services to business customers 
marketing  sales and customer service wwi s sales and marketing strategy is to seek to generate rapid net subscriber growth and increased subscriber revenues in each of its markets 
marketing each of wwi s operating companies markets its products and services under its own brand name and develops its own marketing strategy to address the local market conditions 
the focus of each 
table of contents operating company s marketing efforts is dependent upon a number of factors  including overall market penetration  number of competitors and network coverage 
sales wwi s operating companies sell their products and services through a distribution network including company owned stores  exclusive and non exclusive dealers  national and local retailers  and direct sales forces targeting corporate accounts 
each operating company uses a combination of direct and indirect sales channels  the mix of which is dependent on the local conditions of the market 
the retail channel including retail stores  mini stores and kiosks uses personnel that are trained to educate new customers on products and services and to provide basic customer service 
wwi believes this channel provides the physical presence in local markets necessary to position each operating company as a quality local service provider  while providing greater control over both costs and the sales process 
the indirect channel consists of extensive dealer networks of national and local merchants  specialty retailers and alternative direct marketing firms 
wwi s operating companies also act as retailers of handsets and maintain inventories of handsets 
customer service wwi considers customer service a key element of its operating philosophy and is committed to attracting and retaining subscribers by seeking to provide consistently superior customer care 
each of wwi s operating companies operates a full service call center  where customer inquiries are addressed by well trained customer service personnel and technical staff using sophisticated monitoring and control systems 
competition in each of the markets where wwi s operating companies operate  they compete with other communications services providers including land line telephone companies and other wireless communications companies 
in each european market  wwi competes with two or three other gsm operators 
most of these competitors are well established companies or subsidiaries of well established companies 
for example  in austria our competitors include telekom austria ag and t mobile austria gmbh 
in many cases  such companies have substantially greater financial and marketing resources  larger subscriber bases  better name recognition and in some cases  larger coverage areas than those of wwi s operating companies 
in the future  we expect to face new competition from entities licensed to provide similar services using other communications technologies  including so called third generation technology 
in each of wwi s european markets  existing wireless operators and  in some cases  a new entrant  have deployed third generation infrastructure and services 
we do not believe third generation services have created a significant competitive threat to our operations to date and we are unsure of when they will become a competitive threat 
suppliers and equipment vendors wwi s operating companies do not manufacture any of the handsets  cell site or switching equipment used in their operations 
the high degree of compatibility among different manufacturers models of handsets  cell site and switching equipment allows wwi s operating companies to design  supply and operate their systems without being dependent upon any single source of such equipment 
the handsets and cell site equipment used in our operations are available for purchase from multiple sources 
the largest handset manufacturers of wwi s european operations are nokia corporation and siemens ag 
wwi purchases cell site and switching equipment primarily from alcatel  siemens ag and nortel networks  inc governmental regulation the licensing  construction  operation and ownership of communications systems  and the granting and renewal of applicable licenses and radio frequency allocations  are regulated by governmental entities in each of the countries in which wwi s operating companies conduct business 
the licenses which allow wwi s operating companies to provide wireless licenses were initially granted for terms of or years and in some cases there are not explicit provisions in the licenses which allow for renewal 
under the terms of the ghana license  westel was required to meet certain customer levels and build out requirements by february westel was unable to meet the required customer levels and build out 
table of contents requirements due to the inability of the regulator to provide spectrum and enforce interconnection with the incumbent telephone company and all development has been suspended 
the national communication authority of ghana nca has assessed a penalty claim of approximately million for not meeting these build out requirements 
westel has contested this fine on the basis that the government and the nca failed to deliver the key commitments of spectrum and interconnection and does not believe the enforcement of these penalties is probable  but there can be no assurance to that effect 
employees and labor relations wwi considers its labor relations to be good 
as of december   wwi s consolidated operating companies employed a total of  people in the following areas number of category employees sales and marketing engineering general and administrative  including customer service risk factors a significant portion of our revenues are derived from roaming and our failure to maintain favorable roaming arrangements could materially adversely affect our future operating results roaming revenues accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have roaming agreements with most of the wireless carriers in north america  including at t wireless  cingular  tmo  verizon and sprint 
our largest roaming partner is at t wireless who accounted for approximately of our domestic revenues in our tdma roaming agreement with at t wireless expires in june and  although they may choose to continue to use our network  they will no longer be contractually required to prefer our network as of july when our roaming agreements expire or are terminated  we may be unable to renegotiate these roaming agreements or to obtain roaming agreements with other wireless providers upon acceptable terms 
further  some competitors may be able to obtain roaming rates and terms that are more favorable than those obtained by us 
at t wireless and cingular have announced their intention to transition their customer bases to a gsm platform 
in may  we announced the signing of additional long term roaming agreements with tmo  which expires december  and cingular  which expires march  to provide gsm services to their customers using our network 
further  in july  we announced the signing of an additional gsm long term roaming agreement with at t wireless  which expires december in february  our two largest roaming partners at t wireless and cingular announced a merger 
we are unsure of the impact this will have on us  if any 
we began offering gsm roaming services in the third quarter of if we are not able to maintain and expand our roaming footprint or complete our gsm buildout or maintain favorable roaming arrangements with other wireless carriers  our coverage area or pricing we offer relative to our competitors may not be as attractive 
these factors would have a material adverse effect on our future business  operations and financial condition 
although gsm roaming revenue was insignificant in  the inability to provide gsm service to the customers of national carriers who have deployed the gsm platform as they add new gsm customers would have a material adverse affect on our future business  operations and financial condition 
while our roaming agreements generally require other carriers customers to use our network when roaming  our roaming agreements generally do not prevent our roaming partners from acquiring licenses to provide competing services in our markets 
further  our roaming partners could negotiate a roaming agreement in all or portions of our markets with another wireless carrier 
if any of our roaming partners were to acquire the required licenses and build networks in our markets or enter into roaming agreements with other wireless carriers that provide competing services in our markets and permit our roaming partners to roam on that other carrier s network  we could lose a substantial portion of our roaming revenues in those markets  
table of contents which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition 
our roamer revenue is also highly dependent upon pricing decisions made by our roaming partners 
if our roaming partners include our territory in their customers home calling area  such as with national pricing plans  we will see more usage and revenue than if they charged roaming to their customers by the minute 
our usf revenues are subject to changes in fcc regulations and may not continue if regulations change the company is an etc in states plus the pine ridge indian reservation and is eligible to receive universal service support in of these states plus the pine ridge indian reservation 
in  the company will seek to broaden its etc status and eligibility to receive universal service support 
there is no guarantee that the company will be able to obtain etc status in additional areas and increase its eligibility for universal service support 
furthermore  the fcc is currently considering whether to change the rules governing the eligibility of cellular carriers to receive usf payments 
although the fcc is not expected to make any final decisions on changes in the rules until or later  there is a risk that the fcc and state commissions may impose additional regulatory obligations on etcs that limit the scope of usf eligibility or that the company may find unacceptable 
at this time  it is not clear what impact changes in the rules  if any  will have on the company s continued eligibility to receive universal service support 
loss of usf revenues could adversely effect our future financial performance 
we have a significant amount of debt  which may limit our ability to raise additional capital to meet our future funding and debt service requirements as of december   our total consolidated long term indebtedness was approximately billion  including a current portion of million 
this includes long term and current indebtedness of our international subsidiaries of million and million  respectively 
the credit facilities of our international subsidiaries are used to finance their own operations and consist primarily of million outstanding under our austrian entity s term loan  excluding accrued interest  million outstanding under our slovenian entity s credit facility  and million outstanding under our bolivian entity s bridge loan 
the present level of our debt could limit our ability to obtain future debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
the availability of additional financing is dependent upon the condition of the capital markets 
the extent of additional financing that we may require will depend on  among other things  the success of our operations 
our existing debt also has substantial interest and principal payment obligations  which we will continue to need to meet through our operations or future financings 
in the event we are unable to raise additional capital to meet our future funding and debt service requirements  our business  strategy  operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
certain restrictive covenants in our debt obligations could limit actions that we may take with respect to our business  and our failure to comply with such covenants could cause our debt to become immediately due and payable our domestic credit facility and the indentures relating to our senior notes and our convertible subordinated notes contain  and any additional financing agreements may contain  certain restrictive covenants 
the restrictions in our domestic credit facility and our senior notes affect  and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  sell assets  make investments and acquisitions  pay dividends and engage in mergers and consolidations 
the restrictions in our convertible subordinated notes limit  among other things  our ability to engage in mergers and consolidations 
additionally  our domestic credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
while we are currently in compliance with such covenants  we cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance or will be able to obtain any modifications or waivers that might be required in the future 
an event of default under our domestic credit facility  our convertible subordinated notes or our senior notes would allow the lenders or note holders to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness 
in such event  it is likely that all of our indebtedness would become immediately due and payable 

table of contents the debt facilities of our international operating companies also contain certain restrictive covenants and financial covenants 
under the slovenian credit facility  western wireless international corporation has agreed to guarantee the loan and agreed to financial and other covenants  including  among other things  an obligation to fund vega s cash shortfalls and restrictions which limit the ability of western wireless international corporation and its majority owned subsidiaries to incur indebtedness  grant security interests  dispose of majority owned subsidiaries and enter into guarantees 
while we are currently in compliance with such covenants  we cannot assure you that we will remain in compliance or will be able to obtain modifications or waivers that might be required in the future 
nuevatel  sa nuevatel  a subsidiary of wwi  has a bridge loan facility bolivian bridge loan 
wwi has guaranteed its prorata share  based upon its ownership interest in nuevatel  of the bolivian bridge loan 
in november  nuevatel entered into a credit facility agreement bolivian credit facility with the overseas private investment corporation opic to refinance the bolivian bridge loan and provide funding for the implementation and expansion of nuevatel s network in bolivia 
although we anticipate a funding of the bolivian credit facility s entire commitment of million in one tranche by march   there can be no assurance that such funding will occur by such date  if at all 
the bolivian credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including a debt service coverage ratio which does not become effective until the first quarter in which a principal payment is made 
other covenants include  among other things  limitations on nuevatel s ability to incur additional indebtedness  make certain asset dispositions  make restricted payments and enter into certain mergers  sales or combinations 
under the terms of the bolivian credit facility  wwic has pledged its shares in nuevatel to opic as security for the bolivian credit facility 
as of december   the outstanding amount under the bolivian bridge loan was million and the facility was fully drawn 
the maturity date of the bolivian bridge loan has been extended until march  until the bolivian credit facility closes  we intend to seek additional extensions of the bolivian bridge loan maturity date  but there can be no assurances that any necessary extension will be granted 
our business will require substantial additional capital for continued growth  and our growth may be slowed if we do not have sufficient capital the continued growth and operation of our business will require additional funding for working capital  debt service  the enhancement and upgrade of our networks  the build out of infrastructure to expand our coverage and possible acquisitions of spectrum licenses 
in addition  we will need to use a substantial portion of our future cash flows from operations to make payments of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing funds that could be available for other purposes  such as working capital  the enhancement and upgrade of our network  the build out of infrastructure to expand our coverage and possible acquisitions of spectrum licenses 
additionally  competitive factors  future declines in the united states or international economy  unforeseen construction delays  cost overruns  regulatory changes  engineering and technological changes and other factors may result in funding requirements in excess of current estimates or an inability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations 
we believe that domestic and international operating cash flow and available international loan facilities will be adequate to fund our capital expenditures and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
our domestic and international operating cash flow is dependent upon  among other things the amount of revenue we are able to generate from our customers  the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  and our ability to grow our customer base 
if we do not achieve planned operating cash flow targets  we may be required to curtail capital spending  reduce expenses  or otherwise modify our planned operations and or seek additional debt or equity at the domestic or international level and or restructure or refinance our existing financing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such funds or refinancing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents the need for capital could also cause us to delay or abandon some of our planned growth and development or to seek to sell assets to raise additional funds  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  strategy  operations and financial condition 
given that a substantial portion of our assets consist of intangible assets  principally licenses granted by the fcc  the value of which will depend upon a variety of factors including the success of our business and the wireless communications industry in general  there can be no assurance that our assets could be sold quickly enough  or for sufficient amounts  to enable us to meet our obligations 
we historically have sustained losses from continuing operations and we may not be profitable in the future we had income from continuing operations before cumulative change in accounting principle of million for the year ended december  and had a loss from continuing operations before cumulative change in accounting principle of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion and a net capital deficiency of million 
we may incur additional losses  which could be significant  during the next several years  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to service our debt requirements and other financial needs 
we face substantial competition in all aspects of our domestic business we operate in highly competitive markets and there is substantial and increasing competition in all aspects of the wireless communication business 
competition for subscribers among wireless communications providers is based principally upon the services and features offered  the technical quality of the wireless system  customer service  system coverage  capacity and price 
each of our cellular markets faces at least one cellular competitor  such as verizon  alltel or cingular 
additionally  there are pcs and esmr competitors in most of our metropolitan service areas 
continuing industry consolidation has resulted in an increased presence of regional and national wireless operators within our service areas 
many of these national market competitors provide services comparable to ours and because they operate in a wider geographic area are able to offer no or low cost roaming and toll calls over a wider area 
in addition  some national wireless operators have recently begun to build small networks in certain of the more densely populated or well traveled portions of our service areas 
the use of national advertising and promotional programs by national wireless operators run in our markets are also a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures even though these operators may not provide service in these markets 
we also compete with wireless internet  paging  dispatch services  resellers and land line telephone service providers in some of our service areas 
increasingly  cellular service is becoming a viable alternative to land line voice services for certain customer segments  putting cellular licensees in direct competition with traditional land line telephone service providers 
one or two way paging services that feature voice messaging and data display  as well as tone only service  may be adequate for potential subscribers who do not need to speak to the caller 
potential users of cellular systems may find their communications needs satisfied by other current and developing technologies 
if the wireless communications industry continues to consolidate and we do not participate in that consolidation  even stronger competitors may be created 
effective january   the fcc eliminated the spectrum cap and the cellular cross interest restriction in the larger  urban cellular markets which also may facilitate the creation of larger and more formidable competitors 
see also risk factor entitled a significant portion of our revenues are derived from roaming and our failure to maintain favorable roaming arrangements could materially adversely affect our future operating results 
several of our competitors also operate in multiple segments of the industry 
in the future  we expect to face increased competition from entities providing similar services using other communications technologies 
the auctioning and subsequent deployment of technology in additional spectrum and the disaggregation of spectrum could also generate new competition for us 
while some of these technologies and services are currently operational  others are being developed or may be developed in the future 
given the rapid advances in the wireless communications industry  there can be no assurance that new technologies will not evolve that 
table of contents will compete with our products and services 
in addition  a number of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing and distribution resources 
with so many companies targeting many of the same customers  we may not be able to successfully attract and retain customers and grow our customer base and revenues  and as a result  our profit margins may decrease 
we face intense competition in our european operating companies in our european operating companies  competition based on price  subscription options offered  network coverage and service quality remains intense 
as european markets have become increasingly saturated  the focus of competition has been shifting from customer acquisition to customer retention 
since customer acquisition and retention expenses are substantial  we will incur significant costs to attract new and retain existing customers and significant customer defections would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
failure to develop future business opportunities  such as wireless data services and to improve network coverage  quality and capacity within the markets that we currently serve may limit our ability to compete effectively and grow our business an important element of our strategy is to bring new telecommunications services  such as wireless data services  to rural america 
in general  the development of new services in our industry requires us to anticipate and respond to varied and rapidly changing customer demand 
in order to compete successfully against the other participants in the united states wireless industry  we will need to commercialize and introduce new services on a timely basis 
the ability to deploy and deliver these services relies  in many instances  on new and unproven technology that will demand substantial capital outlays and spectrum capacity 
our available capital and spectrum may not be sufficient to support these services 
we cannot guarantee that devices for such new services or applications for such devices will be commercially available or accepted in the marketplace  and we cannot assure that we will be able to offer these new services profitably 
in addition  there could be legal or regulatory restraints on wireless data services as the applicable laws and rules evolve 
if these services are not successful or if costs associated with implementation and completion of the introduction of these services materially exceed those currently estimated  our ability to retain and attract customers and our operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have essentially completed the network build out of our domestic markets for which we hold licenses  and are now primarily focused on improving network coverage  quality and capacity within and around the markets we currently serve and completing the expansion of digital cdma technology throughout our markets 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in a time frame that will permit us to remain competitive at the cost we expect or at all 
failure or delay in improving network coverage  quality and capacity on a timely basis or at all  or increased costs to accomplish such improvement  could have a material adverse effect on our business  strategy  operations and financial condition 
our fcc licenses are subject to renewal and potential revocation in the event that we violate applicable laws 
the loss of any of such licenses could materially and adversely affect our ability to service our customers our licenses are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the ten year period for which they are granted 
although the fcc has routinely renewed wireless licenses in the past  we cannot provide assurance that no challenges will be brought against our licenses in the future 
violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules could result in license revocations  forfeitures  fines or non renewal of licenses 
we do not have any cellular licenses that are subject to the renewal process in and only two cellular licenses subject to renewal in while we believe that each of our cellular licenses will be renewed  there can be no assurance that all of the licenses will be renewed 
if any of our licenses are forfeited  revoked or not renewed  we would not be able to provide service in that area unless we contract to resell the wireless services of another provider or enter into roaming agreements 

table of contents government regulations determine how we operate  which could increase our costs and limit our growth  revenue and strategy plans the fcc regulates the licensing  construction  operation  acquisition and sale of our domestic business  and we are subject to laws and regulations of other federal  state and local government bodies 
future changes in regulation or legislation could impose significant additional costs on us  either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations  or subject us to sanctions  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  congress and the fcc s continued allocation of additional spectrum for cmrs  which includes cellular and pcs and specialized mobile radio  could significantly increase competition 
the rapid growth and penetration of wireless services has prompted the interest of the fcc  state legislatures and state public utility commissions puc to oversee certain practices by the wireless industry 
these practices are generally in the form of efforts to regulate customer billing  termination of service arrangements  advertising  filing of informational tariffs  certification of operation  and other areas 
while the communications act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of  or the rates charged by  wireless carriers  a state has authority to regulate other terms and conditions of service offerings by cmrs providers 
the fcc has determined that the communications act does not preempt state damage claims as a matter of law  but whether a specific damage award is prohibited would depend upon the facts of a particular case 
this ruling may affect the number of class action suits brought against commercial mobile radio service providers and the amount of damages awarded by courts 
individual states may also petition the fcc for permission to regulate the rates of commercial mobile radio service providers 
the fcc has denied petitions from several states seeking to impose such regulations 
several states have also proposed or enacted consumer protection regulations on cmrs providers 
for example  do not call legislation is either proposed or has been enacted in all states 
in addition  the california puc has proposed extensive consumer protection and privacy regulations for all telecommunications carriers and is considering adopting a consumer bill of rights designed to protect residential and small business customers 
we believe that  if adopted  the rules will significantly alter our business practices in california with respect to nearly every aspect of the carrier customer relationship  including solicitations  marketing  activations  billing and customer care 
the california puc is also contemplating rules to address other service quality issues  including service repair  service outages and toll operator answering time that could apply to commercial mobile radio service providers 
such regulations  if approved  could expose carriers to increased legal responsibility for states varying standards of service quality and may materially impact our operating costs 
at the local level  wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation  and may be subject to fees for use of public rights of way 
although local and state governments cannot categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community  or take actions that have the effect of prohibiting construction  securing state and local government approvals for new tower sites may become a more difficult and lengthy process 
cellular licensees are subject to certain federal aviation administration faa regulations regarding the location  marking lighting and construction of towers 
each tower requiring faa notification also requires tower registration with the fcc 
in addition  our facilities may be subject to regulation by the environmental protection agency and the environmental regulations of the fcc under the national environmental policy act and of certain states and localities 
implementation of wireless local number portability could negatively impact our business the fcc established november  as the extended deadline for cmrs carriers to implement service provider number portability in the top msas 
for markets outside of the top msas  the number portability requirement is triggered only upon receipt of a request by another carrier to implement number portability 
in such cases  carriers have six months to comply with these requests  but are not required to comply prior to may  our mcallen  texas msa market and seven counties within our rsa markets fall within the top msas as defined by the fcc 
the remainder of our markets are subject to the 
table of contents number portability rules in may of number portability allows subscribers to keep their wireless phone number when switching to a different wireless service provider 
we anticipate number portability will increase competition for existing customers  which may put downward pressure on subscriber growth and increase churn  which is likely to increase our costs 
a high rate of churn would adversely affect our results of operations because of loss of revenue and because the cost of adding a new subscriber  which generally includes a commission expense and or significant handset discounts  is a significant factor in income and profitability for participants in the wireless industry 
we may be required to subsidize product upgrades and or reduce pricing to match competitors initiatives and retain customers  which could adversely impact our revenue and profitability 
if consumer dissatisfaction results  it could adversely impact industry growth 
we have received a small number of requests to implement number portability in the us and believe we will be able to comply with the mandatory deadlines 
however  we are currently unable to determine what  if any  impact number portability will have on our future business operations and financial condition 
number portability is also scheduled to be introduced in our austrian market in the third quarter of  however  the actual timing is largely out of our control 
we anticipate number portability will further increase competition for existing austrian customers  which may put downward pressure on subscriber growth and increase churn  which is likely to increase our international costs 
a high rate of churn in our austrian business would adversely affect our results of operations because of loss of revenue and because of the cost of adding a new subscriber 
as with our domestic operations  we may be required to subsidize product upgrades and or reduce pricing to match competitors initiatives and retain customers  which could adversely impact our revenue and profitability 
concerns about health and safety risks may discourage use of wireless services  result in liability issues and materially adversely affect our business media reports have suggested that radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health concerns  including cancer  and may interfere with various electronic medical devices  including hearing aids and pacemakers 
concerns over radio frequency emissions may have the effect of discouraging the use of wireless handsets  and thus decrease demand for wireless products and services 
in recent years  the fcc and foreign regulatory agencies have updated the guidelines and methods they use for evaluating radio frequency emissions from radio equipment  including wireless handsets 
in addition  interest groups have requested that the fcc investigate claims that wireless technologies pose health concerns and cause interference with airbags  hearing aids and medical devices 
the food and drug administration has issued guidelines for the use of wireless phones by pacemaker wearers 
the fcc s safety limits for human exposure to radio frequency emissions went into effect september  after september  if any facility  operation or device is found to be non compliant with radio frequency emissions guidelines  and if any required environmental assessment has not been filed  penalties ranging from fines to license forfeiture may be imposed 
lawsuits have been filed against us  other wireless carriers and other participants in the wireless industry  asserting product liability  breach of warranty  adverse health effects and other claims relating to radio frequency transmissions to and from handsets and wireless data devices 
some of these lawsuits allege other related claims  including negligence  strict liability  conspiracy and the misrepresentation of or failure to disclose these alleged health risks 
the complaints seek substantial monetary damages as well as injunctive relief 
the defense of these lawsuits may divert our management s attention  we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits and we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements 
additional studies of health effects of wireless services are ongoing and new studies are anticipated 
if such further research establishes any link between the use of handsets and health problems  such as brain cancer  then usage of  and demand for our services may be significantly reduced  and we could be required to pay significant expenses in defending lawsuits and significant awards or settlements  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may also be subject to potential litigation relating to the use of handsets and wireless data devices while driving 
some studies have indicated that using these devices while driving may impair drivers attention 
legislation has been proposed in the united states congress and many state and local legislative bodies to restrict or prohibit the use of wireless phones while driving motor vehicles 
to date  new york state and some localities in the united states have passed laws restricting the use of handsets while driving  and similar laws have been enacted in other countries 
additionally  some jurisdictions have passed laws restricting the use of handsets by persons such as school bus drivers and novice drivers 
these laws or  if passed  other laws prohibiting or restricting the use of wireless handsets while driving  could reduce sales  usage and revenues  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition 
finally  we cannot be certain that we or the wireless industry in general may not be subject to litigation should a situation arise in which damage or harm occurs as a result of interference between a cmrs carrier such as us and a public safety licensee  such as a emergency operator  or any failure of any such emergency call while using our network 
any restructuring  spin off or divestiture transaction could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations as part of our overall business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities and alternatives  including acquisitions  dispositions  investments  and sources of capital  consummation of any of which could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
in this regard  we are investigating a spin off or divestiture of our international operations 
although we are giving serious consideration to a spin off of our international operations  as early as the fourth quarter of  no decision has been made as to whether to proceed with such a transaction 
any such decision would be subject to numerous conditions  including  among others  approval by our board of directors of the terms and conditions of such a transaction  favorable market and financing conditions  the tax effects of such a transaction and any required governmental and third party approvals 
if we lose any member of our management team  our business could suffer we depend on the continued services of our management team 
if we fail to retain the services of any member of our senior management  our operating results may be adversely affected 
wwi operates in certain countries with significant political  social and economic uncertainties which could have a material adverse effect on its operations in these countries wwi accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
we operate in countries in a republic of the former soviet union  africa  the caribbean and south america 
these countries face significant political  social and or economic uncertainties  such as recent governmental leadership changes in georgia and bolivia  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these areas 
these uncertainties include possible internal military conflicts and or civil unrest fueled by economic and social crises in those countries  political instability and bureaucratic infighting between government agencies with unclear and overlapping jurisdictions  pervasive regulatory control of the state over the telecommunications industry  and the failure by government entities to meet their outstanding foreign debt repayment obligations 
we cannot assure you that the pursuit of economic reforms by the governments of any of these countries will continue or prove to be ultimately effective  especially in the event of a change in leadership  social or political disruption or other circumstances affecting economic  political or social conditions

our customer growth in slovenia is negatively impacted by the pricing practices of the state owned telephone company who is also our competitor in slovenia  our largest competitor  the state owned telephone company which has a market share of approximately  charges its customers an exceptionally high tariff to call the customers of our slovenian operating company  vega 
as a result  potential customers may find subscribing to vega s service unattractive since it will be prohibitively expensive for most slovenians to call them 
we believe that these pricing practices are anti competitive and that they violate regulations of slovenia and the european union 
if the slovenian telephone company does not suspend these practices  we may be unable to realize a return on our investment and may be required to impair our investment in our slovenian operating company 
at december   the long term assets in our slovenian entity were approximately million 
certain of the government licenses on which wwi depends could be canceled or revoked  impairing the development of wwi s operations in these countries  and making wwi liable for substantial penalties the licensing  construction  operation and ownership of communications systems  and the granting and renewal of applicable licenses and radio frequency allocations  are regulated by governmental entities in each of the countries in which wwi s operating companies conduct business 
our failure or inability to renew these licenses  or if they are renewed on terms and conditions that are less favorable to us than the terms and conditions that are currently in place  may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
wwi s licenses which allow wwi s operating companies to provide wireless licenses were initially granted for terms of or years and in some cases there are not explicit provisions in the licenses which allow for renewal 
under the terms of the ghana license  wwi s operating company was required to meet certain customer levels and build out requirements by february this company was unable to meet the required customer levels and build out requirements due to the inability of the regulator to provide spectrum and enforce interconnection with the incumbent telephone company and all development has been suspended 
the nca has assessed a penalty claim of approximately million for not meeting these build out requirements 
wwi has contested this fine on the basis that the government and the nca failed to deliver the key commitments 
table of contents of spectrum and interconnection and does not believe the enforcement of these penalties is probable  but there can be no assurance to that effect

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations unless the context requires otherwise  western wireless  the company  we  our and us include us and our subsidiaries 
overview we provide cellular communications services in western states under the cellularone cellularone and western wireless brand names principally through the ownership and operation of cellular wireless systems 
our domestic operations are primarily in rural areas due to our belief that there are certain strategic advantages to operating in these areas 
we provide wireless services in metropolitan service areas msa and rural service areas rsa 
additionally  we own mhz personal communication services pcs licenses for five basic trading areas bta 
further  in we acquired mhz pcs licenses covering portions of btas and major trading areas mta 
subject to completion of certain contractual obligations  we expect to receive an incremental mhz of pcs licenses covering some of these same btas and mtas 
a significant portion of our domestic revenues have historically been derived from roaming 
our network includes the four major technologies currently available in the us these technologies include analog and three digital standards time division multiple access tdma  code division multiple access cdma  and global system for mobile communications gsm 
all of the digital technologies employed by us allow for enhanced capacity and data services 
we have roaming agreements with the five largest wireless carriers in north america  including at t wireless services  inc at t wireless  cingular wireless llc cingular  sprint pcs corporation sprint  t mobile usa  inc tmo and verizon wireless corporation verizon 
these agreements allow their customers to roam on our network and allow our subscribers to utilize those carriers networks 
similarly  these agreements provide attractive rates to us for our customers who roam in areas outside our wireless network 
we own approximately of western wireless international holding corporation wwi 
wwi  through its consolidated subsidiaries and equity investments  is a provider of wireless communications services in seven countries 
wwi owns controlling interests in six of these countries slovenia  austria  ireland  bolivia  haiti and ghana 
we also have an equity interest in georgia 
further  in  wwi sold its minority interest in its croatian joint venture  vip net gsm doo vip net 
in  we suspended operations in c te d ivoire and we are uncertain as to when  or if  operations will be resumed there 
we believe it is important to manage our business using certain key factors both domestically and internationally 
in addition to adjusted ebitda  discussed later see adjustments to reconcile net income loss to adjusted ebitda  the following key factors  among other things  are key indicators monitored by management in assessing the performance of our domestic and international business gross postpaid and prepaid subscriber additions net subscriber additions churn annualized incremental penetration average minutes of use per subscriber average subscriber revenue per average subscriber roamer revenues cost of service per minute of use general and administrative monthly cost per average subscriber 
table of contents cost per gross subscriber addition capital expenditures gross postpaid and prepaid subscriber additions represent the amount of new subscribers we are able to add during the year 
growing our subscriber base by adding new subscribers is a fundamental element of our long term growth strategy 
we must maintain a competitive offering of products and services to sustain our subscriber growth 
net subscriber additions represent the amount of subscribers we were able to add to our service during the year after deducting the number of disconnected or terminated subscribers 
by monitoring our growth against our forecast  we believe we are better able to anticipate our future operating performance 
churn represents the number of subscribers that disconnect or are terminated from our service or where there is a lack of usage by prepaid customers for a prescribed period of time 
we monitor and seek to control churn so that we can grow our business without incurring significant sales and marketing costs needed to replace disconnected subscribers 
we must continue to ensure that we offer excellent network quality and customer service so that our churn rates remain low 
our annualized incremental penetration measures the growth of our subscriber base relative to population 
annualized incremental penetration also provides a means of comparing our growth rate against that of our peers 
while acceleration in our growth rates typically results in higher current selling and marketing costs see discussion below  it should result in higher long term revenues and profitability 
average minutes of use mou per subscriber represents how much our customers utilize our service offerings 
we monitor growth in mous to ensure that the access and overage charges we are collecting are consistent with that growth 
in addition  growth in subscriber usage may indicate a need to invest in additional network capacity 
average revenue per subscriber arpu represents the average monthly subscriber revenue generated by a typical subscriber determined as subscriber revenues divided by average number of subscribers 
we monitor trends in arpu to ensure that our rate plans and promotional offerings are attractive to customers and cost effective 
the majority of our revenues are derived from subscriber revenues 
subscriber revenues include monthly access charges  charges for airtime used in excess of plan minutes  universal service fund usf support payment revenues  usf collection revenues received from customers  long distance revenues derived from calls placed by our customers  international prepaid revenues  international interconnect revenues  and other charges such as activations  voice mail  call waiting and call forwarding 
roamer revenues result from providing service to customers of other wireless carriers when those subscribers roam into our markets and use our systems to carry their calls 
the per minute rate paid by a roamer is established by an agreement between us and the roamer s wireless provider 
the amount of roaming revenue we generate is often dependent upon usage patterns  rate plan mix and technology mix of our roaming partners 
usage patterns by our roaming partners can be difficult to predict so trends in roaming revenues are closely monitored by us 
cost of service per mou represents the cost of providing service divided by subscriber mous 
over time  this metric should typically decrease as we realize economies of scale that are derived from a growing subscriber base and usage 
cost of service consists mainly of the cost of i providing access to local exchange and long distance carrier facilities  ii maintaining the wireless network  and iii off network roaming costs 
general and administrative costs include administrative costs associated with maintaining subscribers  including customer service and other centralized support functions 
general and administrative expenses also include billing costs  subscriber bad debt  insurance and property taxes 
general and administrative monthly costs per average subscriber represent monthly general and administrative costs divided by average subscribers 
we monitor for unaccounted growth in this metric 
typically we should be able to realize economies of scale with a growing subscriber base  however  certain regulatory mandates such as wireless number portability and enhanced e are overhead expenditures for which limited or no cost recovery exists 

table of contents sales and marketing costs include costs associated with acquiring a subscriber  including direct and indirect sales commissions  salaries  advertising and promotional expenses and all costs of retail locations 
equipment sales consist of wireless handset and accessory sales to customers 
we typically sell handsets below cost and regard these losses as a cost of building our subscriber base 
cost of equipment sales consists of the costs related to handset and accessory sales to customers 
cost of equipment sales also includes the cost of handsets associated with customer retention that occurs with the signing of an extended service agreement and the cost of handsets related to migrating customers to digital service on a free or discounted basis 
when costs per gross subscriber addition cpga determined by dividing the sum of sales and marketing costs and cost of equipment sales  reduced by equipment sales  by the number of subscriber additions are discussed  the revenue and costs from handset sales are included with sales and marketing costs because such measure is commonly used in the wireless industry 
we monitor our cpga to ensure that we are adding customers profitably and to ensure the fixed and variable components of our sales and marketing strategy are performing as planned 
capital expenditures represent how much money we have spent on additions to our wireless network and back office infrastructure 
we monitor our capital expenditures to ensure that we are able to generate sufficient growth in cash to cover our debt service requirements and make opportunistic investments 
we believe cash generating capabilities are important as recurring capital expenditures are required in the wireless industry to sustain its subscriber base and revenue growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we must make estimates of the collectability of our subscriber accounts receivable 
management analyzes historical write offs  changes in our internal credit policies and customer concentrations when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
differences may result in the amount and timing of expenses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates or if actual experience differs from estimates 
based on our allowance for doubtful accounts at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the estimate would increase or decrease our consolidated general and administrative expense by approximately million or million  respectively 
our domestic licenses meet the definition of indefinite life intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 impairment must be assessed at least annually  or when indications of impairment exist  on our domestic licenses 
we assess impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value 
the fair value of our domestic licenses is estimated using the discounted present value of expected future cash flows 
the determination of fair value is a complex consideration that involves significant assumptions and estimates 
assumptions and estimates made by us are based on our best judgments and included among other things i an assessment of market and economic conditions including discount rates  ii future operating strategy and performance  iii competition and market share  and iv the nature and cost of technology utilized 
based on our estimate of the fair value performed in  a increase or decrease in the discount rate used would not have indicated our licenses were impaired or resulted in a change to our consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations and comprehensive income loss 

table of contents upon adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
on january   we estimated the fair value of our asset retirement obligations aros associated with those costs of removing component equipment that is subject to retirement from cell sites that reside upon leased property 
assumptions and estimates made by us are based on our best judgments and included among other things an estimate of the aros which will be enforced by the lessor 
absent sufficient history with individual lessors  we are required to assume of our lessors will require us to remove certain equipment and or return the land on which our cell sites are constructed back to its original condition 
if only of lessors were to enforce our remediation obligation our consolidated depreciation  amortization and accretion expense would have decreased by million 
property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation 
to determine the appropriate depreciation period  we must estimate the useful lives of the long lived assets 
depending on the type of asset or the type of technology  lives for i buildings and improvements range from to years  ii wireless communications systems range from to years  and iii furniture and equipment range from to years 
based on our weighted average useful life at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease in the weighted average useful life would decrease or increase our depreciation  amortization and accretion expense by million and million  respectively 
we assess the impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to anticipated minimum future operating results and a significant change in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business 
when we determine that the carrying value of certain long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the indicators of impairment  we then measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in  we conducted an impairment analysis for our investment in slovenia and determined that an impairment did not exist 
we conducted the impairment test because our largest competitor in slovenia  the state owned telephone company which has a market share of approximately  charges its customers an exceptionally high tariff to call the customers of our slovenian operating company  vega 
as a result  potential customers may find subscribing to vega s service unattractive since it will be prohibitively expensive for most slovenians to call them 
we believe that these pricing practices are anti competitive and that they violate regulations of slovenia and the european union 
as part of our impairment analysis  our estimates assume these regulations will change when slovenia joins the european union 
however  if the slovenian telephone company is not required to suspend these practices  we may be unable to realize a return on our investment and may be required to impair our investment in our slovenian operating company 
at december   the long term assets in our slovenian entity were approximately million 
results of domestic operations for the years ended december   and we had  domestic subscribers at december   a increase during we had  domestic subscribers at december   a increase during we had  domestic subscribers at december   a increase during at december   approximately of our subscribers were with a single reseller 
the increase in subscribers from to was due to adding more gross subscribers in  along with lower churn 
the slower growth in as compared to was due to negative net additions in the first quarter of 
table of contents the following table sets forth certain financial data as it relates to our  and domestic operations year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues subscriber revenues roamer revenues equipment sales other revenues total revenues operating expenses cost of service cost of equipment sales general and administrative sales and marketing depreciation  amortization and accretion asset dispositions stock based compensation total operating expenses adjusted ebitda for the definition of adjusted ebitda  and the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda  which is a non gaap financial measure  to net income loss  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  see adjustments to reconcile net income loss to adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is the measure of profitability utilized by our chief operating decision maker and is presented herein in accordance with sfas no 
disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
beginning in the third quarter of  we began including in our subscriber revenues amounts collected from our customers for federal and state universal service fund assessments 
the subsequent remittances to the universal service fund are recorded in general and administrative expenses 
the amounts included in subscriber revenues and general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million each 
the inclusion of these universal service fund amounts in our operating results is in response to a recent trend in the wireless industry supporting this practice 
because the amount was not material to our previously reported revenues  expenses or net loss  we have not changed prior periods 
domestic revenues the increase in subscriber revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was partly due to an increase in arpu and due partly to growth in subscribers 
arpu was in  a increase from in the increase in arpu in is due to many factors including i the receipt of federal universal service fund usf payments as an eligible telecommunications carrier etc for certain of our traditional mobile services customers  which contributed to the increase for the year ended december   ii the inclusion in subscriber revenue of amounts collected from customers for federal and state usf assessments  which contributed to the increase in arpu for the year ended december   and iii a regulatory charge of per month to our subscribers beginning in may to recover the cost of certain unfunded government mandates such as wireless number portability and enhanced e the decrease in subscriber revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to a decrease in arpu partially offset by a growth in average subscribers 
arpu declined from in to in the decline in arpu for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a result of several factors 
table of contents including i the increase in popularity of rate plans that have larger allotments of included minutes  ii larger home calling areas  iii more rate plans that include long distance at no additional charge  and iv an increase in the number of rate plans that share minutes with an existing plan at a lower access rate 
we expect factors such as growth in usf support payments  the inclusion of a full year of subscriber collections for state and federal usf assessments along with an increase in our regulatory charge  implemented in january of  to provide for an overall higher arpu in as compared to we expect to continue to receive universal service fund payments for certain mobile subscribers who reside in areas for which we are eligible to receive such payments through the fcc is currently reviewing the rules under which cellular carriers are eligible to receive usf support payments 
in  we will seek to broaden our etc status and eligibility to receive universal service support 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain etc status in additional areas and increase our eligibility for universal service support 
there is also a risk that the fcc and state commissions may impose additional regulatory obligations on existing etcs that we may find unacceptable 
we can provide no long term assurances that federal usf support payments will continue at the current level  if at all 
the decrease in roamer revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to an million decrease related to lower per minute roaming rates  partially offset by an increase of million related to increased roamer mous 
the lower revenue per minute was primarily the result of scheduled rate decreases charged between carriers 
the increase in roaming traffic is mainly due to increased volume resulting from new contracts signed in with verizon and cingular 
in late  we launched gsm roaming services in certain markets 
the impact of gsm roaming services on roamer revenues in was insignificant 
the decrease in roamer revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to a decrease in the rates charged between carriers partially offset by an increase in roaming traffic on our network 
in july of  at t wireless  currently our largest roaming partner  is no longer contractually required to have its customers prefer our tdma network when roaming in our footprint 
as a result  at t wireless may move some of its existing tdma traffic to other carriers 
further  we have small contractual rate decreases in under our long term contracts with cingular and verizon 
we believe the possibility of a reduction in at t wireless tdma traffic along with the previously mentioned rate decreases will be largely offset by increased minutes with gsm roaming partners and increased traffic with existing cdma roaming partners 
given these items  we expect roaming revenue for will be flat or down slightly as compared to in february  our two largest roaming partners at t wireless and cingular announced a merger 
we are unsure of the impact that this will have on us  if any 
equipment sales have increased over each of the past two years 
the increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to an increase in the number of handsets sold partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per handset sold 
the decrease in the average revenue per handset sold is mainly the result of lower promotional pricing for subscribers who enter into a two year service contract with us 
the increase for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to an increase in the average revenue per handset sold partially offset by a decrease in the number of handsets sold 
the increase in the average revenue per handset in was due to an increase in the number of dual mode and tri mode handsets sold 
we expect to continue to offer promotional handset pricing to subscribers who enter into two year service contracts with us 
domestic operating expenses the decrease in cost of service for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to a decrease in interconnection costs 
in addition  we experienced decreased off network roaming costs for our customers as a result of lower contractual rates 
these savings were partially offset by increased costs associated with supporting growth in the number of subscriber and roamer mous 
the decrease in cost of service for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to decreased off network roaming costs for our customers as a result of lower contractual rates contained in our roaming agreements 
this decrease was partially offset by increased costs associated with supporting growth in the number of subscriber and roamer mous 
cost of service per mou 
table of contents was  and for  and  respectively 
the sequential decreases in cost of service per mou were due mainly to the items discussed above 
we expect cost of service dollars to increase in as compared to due to adding fixed costs to support our new gsm roaming agreements and our growing subscriber base 
we expect cost of service per mou to continue to gradually decline in as compared to cost of equipment sales increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the volume of handsets sold partially offset by a decrease in the average per unit cost of handsets sold 
we have seen a decrease in the average per unit cost year over year as the types of handsets we are offering have remained relatively stable and we have seen some price declines from vendors 
cost of equipment sales decreased slightly for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was the result of a decrease in the volume of handsets sold offset by an increase in the average per unit cost of handsets sold due to a greater proportion of digital handsets in the overall handsets sold mix 
in  we expect that technological requirements to support new features in our hellopix  hellotxt and helloweb offerings  along with demand for feature rich handsets  will increase our per unit cost of handsets 
although subscribers generally are responsible for purchasing or otherwise obtaining their own handsets  we have historically sold handsets below cost to respond to competition and general industry practice and expect to continue to do so in the future 
general and administrative costs increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the year over year increase was a result of i the inclusion of universal service fund remittances beginning in the third quarter of  ii an increase in bad debt expense  and iii an increase in costs to support a larger subscriber base 
general and administrative costs decreased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to our efforts during to reduce our operating costs 
our general and administrative monthly cost per average subscriber was  and in  and  respectively 
in  the universal service fund remittances increased our general and administrative monthly cost per average subscriber by 
the decrease on a per average subscriber basis in compared to was primarily due to our efforts to reduce costs in  as previously discussed 
we anticipate monthly cost per average subscriber to increase in compared to driven by a full year of usf remittances being included in compared to only six months being included in sales and marketing costs increased slightly for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to increases in variable costs such as direct commissions and dealer related costs 
the decrease in sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  was primarily the result of a decrease in the fixed cost components for example rents  utilities and advertising of sales and marketing partially offset by an increase in variable cost components as we executed our strategy to shift to a more variable cost structure 
in  cpga was compared to in and in the decrease in cpga in compared to the same period in is due to reductions in the loss on equipment sales and reductions in the fixed cost components of sales and marketing 
these decreases are partially offset by increases in retention and variable costs 
we include digital handset subsidies incurred in retaining existing subscribers in subscriber acquisition costs 
these retention costs had a  and impact on cpga for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cpga in compared to the same period in resulted mainly from fixed sales and marketing costs  including costs of retaining existing subscribers  being spread over fewer gross subscriber additions 
cpga is expected to decrease in compared to as we expect to increase our gross additions year over year while holding our sales and marketing costs  including losses on equipment sales  relatively flat 
depreciation  amortization and accretion expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was due primarily to the acceleration of depreciation as we consolidated and decommissioned certain switching assets 
the increase in depreciation  amortization and accretion expense for as compared to was mainly attributable to the growth of wireless communication system assets partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense associated with the discontinuance of license amortization with the adoption on january  of sfas no 

table of contents the asset dispositions loss for the year ended december  resulted from recording a million impairment charge related to the sale of our arizona rsa 
the sales price of this rsa reflected that future cash flows would be less than the carrying value of the license 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment related to this rsa in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
this transaction closed during the third quarter of the asset dispositions loss for the year ended december  resulted from recording a million impairment charge related to the exploration and sale of the arizona rsa discussed above 
we also recognized a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  related to the disposition of certain of our paging assets 
these charges were offset by a gain of approximately million resulting from the sale of certain specialized mobile radio and competitive local exchange carrier assets

total sales and marketing expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to increased sales and promotion expenses attributable to higher subscriber additions  mainly in austria  and the strengthening of the euro as compared to the us dollar

we expect cpga to increase in as compared to the same period in  exclusive of changes in currency exchange rates  mainly due to higher customer acquisition costs  primarily in austria and ireland 
total depreciation  amortization and accretion expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due primarily to network expansion in our european markets and the strengthening of the euro as compared to the us dollar 
the increase in total depreciation  amortization and accretion expense in from was mainly due to network expansion in our european markets and the launch of slovenia in december as wwi continues to add wireless infrastructure to service its growing international subscriber base  we anticipate depreciation  amortization and accretion expense will increase in future periods 
the change in total stock based compensation each year is primarily a result of a revaluation of wwi s stock appreciation rights sars based on current market conditions 
international adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda refer to definition at adjustments to reconcile net income loss to adjusted ebitda for our international consolidated subsidiaries improved for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the million increase in international adjusted ebitda was mainly due to a million increase  from million in to million in  in adjusted ebitda in austria  as a result of cost efficiencies and revenue growth in increases in adjusted ebitda across all other countries included in our other international segment accounted for the remaining increase of million 
adjusted ebitda for our international consolidated subsidiaries improved from to due to the inclusion of austria s results of operations from acquisition in june and the launch of operations in ireland in the first quarter of we expect international adjusted ebitda to improve in as a result of continued subscriber growth and cost efficiencies in existing markets  primarily austria 
adjustments to reconcile net income loss to adjusted ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure generally defined as net income loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we use the non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda which further excludes the following items i accretion  ii asset dispositions  iii stock based compensation  net  iv equity in net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates  net of tax and other  net  v gain loss on sale of joint venture  vi loss on extinguishment of debt  vii minority interests in net loss of consolidated subsidiaries  viii discontinued operations  and ix cumulative change in accounting principle 
each of these items is presented in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
other companies in the wireless industry may define adjusted ebitda in a different manner or present other varying financial measures  and  accordingly  the company s presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
the company s calculation of adjusted ebitda is also not directly comparable to ebit earnings before interest and taxes or ebitda 
the company views adjusted ebitda as an operating performance measure and as such  believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda is net income loss 
the company has presented adjusted ebitda because this financial measure  in combination with other financial measures  is an integral part of the company s internal reporting system utilized by management to assess and evaluate the performance of its business 
adjusted ebitda is also considered a significant performance measure 
it is used by management as a measurement of the company s success in obtaining  retaining and servicing customers by reflecting the company s ability to generate subscriber revenue while providing a high level of customer service in a cost effective manner 
the components of adjusted ebitda include the key revenue and expense items for which the company s operating managers are responsible and upon which the company evaluates their performance 

table of contents adjusted ebitda is consistent with certain financial measures used in the company s domestic credit facility and the indenture for our senior notes 
such financial measures are key components of several negative covenants including  among others  the limitation on incurrence of indebtedness  the limitations on investments and acquisitions and the limitation on distributions and dividends 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income loss  as determined in accordance with gaap  as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities  as determined in accordance with gaap  or as a measure of liquidity 
the company believes adjusted ebitda is useful to investors as a means to evaluate the company s operating performance prior to financing costs  deferred tax charges  non cash depreciation and amortization expense  and certain other non cash charges 
although adjusted ebitda may be defined differently by other companies in the wireless industry  the company believes that adjusted ebitda provides some commonality of measurement in analyzing operating performance of companies in the wireless industry

the increase was partially offset by a decrease in domestic interest expense due primarily to a decrease in our domestic weighted average debt balance 
interest and financing expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to a reduction in our weighted average interest rate partially offset by an increase in our average long term debt 
long term debt was incurred primarily to fund our capital expenditures  acquisition of wireless properties and international projects

the loss consisted of premium payments  the write off of deferred financing charges and the cancellation of related interest rate hedges in connection with the redemption by us of the senior subordinated notes due and the and notes  and the write off of deferred financing charges related to the slovenian credit facility amendment 
consolidated provision for income taxes the decrease in the provision for income taxes in compared to relates to the adoption of sfas no 
in in  we incurred a deferred income tax provision of approximately million mainly to increase the valuation allowance related to our nol carryforwards 
this charge included million as the initial effect as of january  we have significant deferred tax liabilities related to our domestic licenses 
historically  we did not need a valuation allowance for the portion of our nol carryforward equal to the amount of license amortization expected to occur during the nol carryforward period 
since we ceased amortizing domestic licenses on january  for book purposes and we can no longer estimate the amount  if any  of deferred tax liabilities related to our domestic licenses  which will reverse during the nol carryforward period  we increased the valuation allowance accordingly 
subsequent to january  we are required to continue to amortize our domestic licenses for federal income tax purposes  but as previously discussed  domestic license costs are no longer amortized for book purposes 
the ongoing 
table of contents difference between book and tax amortization resulted in an additional deferred income tax provision of approximately million for the year ended december  the continuing deferred income tax provision results from growth in our deferred tax liability that cannot be estimated to reverse during our nol carryforward period 
this adjustment reflects tax accounting requirements and is not based on any changes to our business model  future prospects  the value of our licenses or our assessment of the likelihood of utilizing the tax nol carryforwards on a cash tax basis in the future 
for the year ended december   the domestic deferred income tax provision was million 
this deferred income tax provision was comprised of million related to the ongoing difference between book and tax amortization on our domestic licenses for the year ended december  and million associated with book tax differences related to our acquisition of mhz pcs licenses acquired from tmo 
these tax expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in our deferred income tax provision related to reversing the cumulative deferred income tax provision associated with the sale of our arizona rsa reflected in asset dispositions 
deferred income taxes represent a non cash charge and are not currently paid or payable and accordingly there is no impact on cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities 
we will continue to evaluate the need for this valuation allowance for accounting purposes to determine if we should reverse all or part of the allowance in the future 
our consolidated provision for income taxes also reflects million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to our operations in haiti 
consolidated net income loss from continuing operations before cumulative change in accounting principle on a consolidated basis  income loss from continuing operations before cumulative change in accounting principle increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase resulted mainly from increases discussed in domestic adjusted ebitda and international adjusted ebitda and increases in consolidated other income expense and a decrease in consolidated provision for income taxes 
the increase in the net loss from continuing operations before cumulative change in accounting principle for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of the domestic provision for income taxes  as discussed above  along with an increase in depreciation  amortization and accretion 
the increase in depreciation  amortization and accretion was primarily in our international operations 
these items were offset by improvements in both international and domestic adjusted ebitda  as discussed above

approximately billion of these foreign nol carryforwards in austria were assigned no value in purchase accounting resulting from the acquisition of tele 
ring in these nol carryforwards are not available in the united states 
the federal nol carryforwards will expire between our tax years and we may be limited in our ability to use these carryforwards in any one year due to ownership changes that preceded the business combination that formed us in july and due to changes in shareholdings that occurred during we believe that  based on a number of factors  there is uncertainty regarding the realization of our nol carryforwards 
consolidated liquidity and capital resources in july  we amended our credit facility with a consortium of lenders as amended  the credit facility

in november  nuevatel entered into a credit facility agreement bolivian credit facility with the overseas private investment corporation opic to refinance the bolivian bridge loan and provide funding for the implementation and expansion of nuevatel s network in bolivia 
the terms of the bolivian refinancing have been substantially negotiated and we are currently working to satisfy conditions precedent to funding the bolivian credit facility 
we anticipate a funding of the bolivian credit facility s entire commitment of million in one tranche by march  repayments will begin in the second quarter of  and end in the first quarter of interest will accrue at a base rate commensurate with united states government sponsored enterprise securities  plus 
the bolivian credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including a debt service coverage ratio which does not become effective until the first quarter in which a principal payment is made

nuevatel s reimbursement obligations under the letter of credit will be secured by cash collateral provided by wwic 
as of december   the outstanding amount under the bolivian bridge loan was million and the facility was fully drawn 
the maturity date of the bolivian bridge loan has been extended until march  until the bolivian credit facility closes  we intend to seek additional extensions of the bolivian bridge loan maturity date  but there can be no assurances that any necessary extension will be granted 
none of our international loan facilities have recourse to western wireless corporation 
as previously discussed  wwi and certain of its subsidiaries have severally guaranteed the bolivian bridge loan and the slovenian credit facility 
in  if we attain our domestic subscriber growth projections  we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures primarily to complete our domestic cdma overlay and expand our gsm coverage

wwi plans to fund its needs through cash flow from operations in austria  bolivia  haiti and ghana  local foreign borrowings in bolivia  proceeds from its potential refinancing activities  in combination with  to the extent necessary  up to million in contributions and advances from western wireless 
we believe that domestic operating cash flow and available international loan facilities will be adequate to fund our projected domestic and international capital requirements 
in  we intend to reborrow approximately million under revolver a of the credit facility in order to make the required excess cash flow prepayment required by the credit facility 
our domestic business plans do not indicate a need to increase our net borrowing under the credit facility  even though borrowing capacity is expected to exist 
if we do not achieve planned domestic operating cash flow targets  quarterly covenants and borrowing limitations contained in the credit facility and the notes may trigger a limitation on the available borrowing capacity under the credit facility 
our operating cash flow is dependent upon  among other things i the amount of revenue we are able to generate from our customers  ii the amount of operating expenses required to provide our services  iii the cost of acquiring and retaining customers  and iv our ability to grow our customer base 
in order to comply with debt covenants or in the event that the borrowing capacity under the credit facility is limited  we may be required to curtail capital spending  reduce expenses  or otherwise modify our planned operations and or seek additional debt or equity at the domestic or international level and or restructure or refinance our existing financing arrangements 
our ability to raise additional capital  if necessary  is subject to a variety of factors  including i the commercial success of our operations  ii the volatility and demand of the capital markets  conditions in the economy generally and the telecommunications industry specifically  and iii other factors we cannot presently predict with certainty 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available to us or if such funding will be available on acceptable terms 
as part of our overall business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities and alternatives  including acquisitions  dispositions  investments  and sources of capital  consummation of any of which could have a material effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
in this regard  we are investigating a spin off or divestiture of our international operations 
although we are giving serious consideration to a spin off of our international operations  as early as the fourth quarter of  no decision has been made as to whether to proceed with such a transaction 
any such decision would be subject to numerous conditions  including  among others  approval by our board of directors of the terms and conditions of such a transaction  favorable market and financing conditions  the tax effects of such a transaction and any required governmental and third party approvals 
on may   we distributed to our shareholders our entire interest in voicestream  now tmo the spin off 
prior to the spin off  we received a ruling from the internal revenue service that the spin off would not result in the recognition of income or gain by us or our shareholders 
notwithstanding the ruling  however  we but not our shareholders would recognize gain as a result of the spin off if the spin off were part of a prohibited plan  that is  a plan or series of related transactions pursuant to which one or more persons acquired  directly or indirectly  percent or more of our or voicestream s stock during the four year period beginning two years before the spin off 
because an acquisition totaling percent or more of voicestream s stock occurred during this period  a rebuttable presumption exists that the spin off was part of a prohibited plan 
although the issue is not free from doubt  we believe that the spin off was not part of a prohibited plan and that the presumption can be rebutted 
in conjunction with the spin off  voicestream agreed to indemnify us on an after tax basis for any taxes imposed on us if an acquisition of voicestream s stock causes the spin off to be part of a prohibited plan 
as a result  if the presumption that the spin off was part of a prohibited plan is not successfully rebutted  we believe that voicestream would be responsible for our resulting tax liability arising from the spin off 
even if it is ultimately determined that the spin off was part of a prohibited plan  we believe that tmo is capable of funding its indemnity obligation to us

recently issued accounting standards in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements  superceded as a result of the issuance of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

the wording of sab was changed to reflect the issuance of eitf no 
 however  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab we have reviewed sab and determined that there was no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 
 which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances  many of which were previously 
table of contents classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for us for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and for fiscal periods beginning after june  for existing financial instruments 
on october   the fasb voted to defer the provisions of paragraphs and of sfas no 
as they apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests 
we will evaluate the applicability of any changes to these provisions upon their reissuance 
there was no impact to our financial position or results of operations as a result of adopting those provisions of sfas no 
that remained in effect 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 

the objective of fin no 
is to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
prior to fin no 
 a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if that company controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is either subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities  entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january  regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we adopted the provisions of fin no 
effective january  for new or revised agreements and adopted the provisions of fin no 
for existing agreements on july  in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin no 
 which  among other things  deferred the effective date for certain variable interests 
applications is required for interest in special purpose entities in the period ending after december  and application is required for all other types of variable interest entities in the period ending after march  the adoption of the effective provisions of fin no 
had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations and we do not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others fin no 

fin no 
requires the disclosure by the guarantor of certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin no 
also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of the guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin no 
does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
fin no 
incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superceded 
fin no 
is to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin no 
had no material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf no 
 addressing the accounting for cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor  including vendor rebates and refunds 
the consensus reached states that consideration received should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products or services and should therefore be shown as a reduction of cost of sales in the income statement of the customer 
the provisions of this consensus are applied prospectively and are consistent with our existing accounting policy 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
supersedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
was applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and had no material effect on our financial positions or results of operations 
seasonality we have historically experienced highest usage and revenue per subscriber during the summer months 
we expect this trend to continue

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management we are exposed to various market financial risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates 
as part of our risk management program  we utilize interest rate caps  swaps and collars to hedge a portion of our variable rate interest risk 
interest rate risk our domestic operations have variable rate debt that at december  had an outstanding balance of billion 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying value 
of this variable rate debt at december   million was hedged using interest rate caps  swaps and collars 
the caps  swaps and collars in effect at december  expire at various dates between march and march the hedges in effect at december   fixed libor between and 
based on our domestic unhedged variable rate obligations outstanding at december  a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the libor rate would have increased or decreased our domestic annual interest expense by approximately million 
our international operations also have variable rate debt that  at december  had an outstanding balance of approximately billion 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying value 
of this variable rate debt at december   million was hedged using an interest rate swap  which fixes the interest rate at through november based on wwi s unhedged variable rate obligations outstanding at december  a increase or decrease in each borrowing s average interest rate would  respectively  increase or decrease wwi s annual interest expense by approximately million 
the potential increases or decreases discussed above are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of variable rate debt for all maturities and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period 
foreign currency risk currently  of our total international revenues are denominated in us dollars 
certain of our international subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar and their assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
a appreciation in the us dollar would have resulted in an approximately million decrease in income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative change in accounting principle for the twelve months ended december  such a change in income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative change in accounting principle would have resulted from applying a different exchange rate to translate and revalue the financial statements of our international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollars 
at december   our slovenian operations  whose functional currency is the slovenian tolar  had variable rate debt of approximately million denominated and repayable in euros and our austrian operations  whose functional currency is the euro  had variable rate debt  including accrued interest of approximately million denominated and repayable in euros 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet at december  a appreciation in the euro as compared to the slovenian tolar would have resulted in an approximately million increase in income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative change in accounting principle during the twelve months ended december  such a change in income loss from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and cumulative change in accounting principle would have been the result of an unrealized foreign exchange loss 
a appreciation in the euro and slovenian tolar as compared to the us dollar would have resulted in an approximately million increase in debt outstanding at december  with an offsetting currency translation adjustment
