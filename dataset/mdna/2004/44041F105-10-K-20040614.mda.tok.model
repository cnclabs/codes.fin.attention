item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the corporation and its subsidiary 
the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in item herein 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements which are based on assumptions and describe future plans  strategies and expectations of the corporation 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by use of the word believe  expect  intend  anticipate  estimate  project  or similar words 
the corporation s ability to predict results of the actual effect of future plans or strategies is uncertain 
factors which could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s operations include  but are not limited to  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions  legislative regulatory changes  monetary and fiscal policies of the us government  including policies of the us treasury and the federal reserve board  the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios  demand for loan products  deposit flows  competition  demand for financial services in the corporation s market areas and accounting principles and guidelines 
these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements and you should not rely too much on these statements 
general the corporation s results of operations depend primarily on revenue generated as a result of its net interest income and non interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the corporation earns on its interest earning assets consisting primarily of loans and investment securities and the interest the corporation pays on its interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of customer savings and money market accounts  time deposits and borrowings 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges on deposit and loan accounts  gains on the sale of loans and investments  and loan servicing fees 
the corporation s results of operations are also affected by our provisions for loan losses and other expenses 
other expenses consist primarily of non interest expense  including compensation and benefits  occupancy  equipment  data processing  marketing  automated teller machine costs and  when applicable  deposit insurance premiums 
the corporation s results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
operating strategy the corporation does not presently engage in any activities outside of serving as a shell parent company for the bank 
the operating strategy of the corporation has been to expand and diversify the consolidated operations of the corporation across a variety of companies and or operating units that are engaged in complementary  but different  businesses and or operating strategies 
this diversification strategy is expected to continue as opportunities arise  although there are no specific acquisitions or new business formations planned at this time 
the primary business of the bank is to acquire funds in the form of deposits and wholesale funds  and to use the funds to make commercial  consumer  and real estate loans in its primary market area 
in addition  the bank invests in a variety of investment grade securities including  but not necessarily limited to us government and federal agency obligations  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt  equity securities  and municipal securities 
the bank intends to continue to fund its assets primarily with retail and commercial deposits  although fhlb advances  and other wholesale borrowings  may be used as a supplemental source of funds 
the corporation s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the income it receives on the bank s loan and investment portfolio and the bank s cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is also affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets equal or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the corporation s profitability is also affected by the level of the bank s other income and expenses 
other noninterest income includes income associated with the origination and sale of mortgage loans  loan servicing fees and net gains and losses on sales of interest earning assets 
other noninterest expenses include compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  deposit insurance premiums  data servicing expenses and other operating costs 
the corporation s results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government legislation  regulation  and monetary and fiscal policies 
the bank s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank  dedicated to commercial lending  home mortgage lending  consumer lending  small business lending and providing quality financial services to local personal and business customers 
the bank has sought to implement this strategy by i focusing on commercial banking opportunities  ii continued efforts towards the origination of residential mortgage loans  including one to four family residential construction loans  iii providing high quality  personalized financial services to individuals and business customers and communities served by its branch network  iv selling many of its fixed rate mortgages to the secondary market  v focusing on asset quality  vi containing operating expenses  and vii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements combined with prudent growth 
critical accounting estimate management recognizes that loan losses occur over the life of a loan  and that the allowance for loan losses must be maintained at a level sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s determination of the allowance is based on a number of factors  including the level of non performing loans  loan loss experience  credit concentrations  a review of the quality of the loan portfolio  collateral values and uncertainties in economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is charged against current period operating results and decreased by the amount of actual loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future losses on loans  and the impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively affect earnings 
the corporation operates under a general loan loss reserve system 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  actual loan loss experience  current and anticipated economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
the reserve is based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time financial statements are prepared  but the ultimate recovery of loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the bank s control  which may result in losses or recoveries differing significantly from those provided for in the financial statements 
the bank maintains an allowance for credit losses sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the bank has established a systematic methodology to ensure that the allowance is adequate 
the allowance is calculated by applying a loss percentage factor to the various loan pool types based on past due ratios  historical loss experience  the regulatory and internal credit grading and classification systems  and general economic conditions that could affect the collectibility of the portfolio 
these factors may be adjusted for events that are significant in management s judgment as of the evaluation date 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the general allowance include loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments  governmental regulatory actions  recent loss experience in a particular segments of the portfolio and the duration of the current business cycle 
the general allowance addresses risks in the portfolio that are not specifically associated with a pool or individual loan but exist due to changes in economic conditions  rapid loan portfolio growth  changes in credit underwriting  weakness in specific loan markets  unseasoned nature of loan portfolio  and new loan products 
the corporation s senior management reviews and analyzes the loan portfolio  charge offs  and allowance on a quarterly basis 
management then discusses the development and calculation of this critical accounting estimate with the executive committee of the board of directors 
the audit committee also reviews the corporation s disclosures including this critical accounting estimate 
management reviewed and evaluated the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance at march  and believes that the allowance is adequate for the risk inherent in the loan portfolio considering the growth  unseasoned loans  and relatively weak economic environment 
in the review  management determined that the allowance was adequate at of gross loans  or million 
the allowance was of gross loans or million at march  in fiscal  the loan portfolio grew to million at march  from million at march  the strong portfolio growth in the last few years has resulted in a relatively unseasoned loan portfolio which has the potential for increased loan losses 
the loan portfolio has experienced substantial growth especially in multi family and commercial real estate loans 
at march   the multi family and commercial real estate portfolios totaled million up from the million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance is primarily attributable to the substantial growth in the loan portfolio and the unseasoned nature of the portfolio  all of which has occurred in a relatively weak economic environment 
the bank recorded net charge offs of     and  during the years ended march      and  respectively 
consumer loans including home equity totaled million or of the loan portfolio at march  visa card loans and one commercial loan accounted for all of the bank s charge offs 
based on historical trends  the bank is expected to continue to charge off consumer loans in excess of  a year 
the provision for loan losses has fluctuated depending on the growth of the loan portfolio and the level of charge offs especially during weak economic times 
the provision for loan losses was million  million  million   and  for the fiscal years ended     and  respectively 
if management s estimate of the allowance deviated by plus or minus then the million allowance would either decrease to million or increase to million 
the provision for loan losses would then subsequently decrease or increase by million 
accordingly  net income would increase or decrease by  after federal income taxes 
critical accounting policies the corporation s significant accounting principles are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment than do our other significant accounting policies detailed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation reviews historical origination and charge off relationships  charge off experience factors  collection data  delinquency reports  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions and trends and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to the appropriateness of the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses 
loans are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the corporation repossesses and disposes of the collateral or the account is otherwise deemed uncollectible 
the corporation believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates 
investments 
the corporation classifies its investments as either available for sale or held to maturity 
available for sale securities are reported at their fair value  which is determined by obtaining quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are included in other comprehensive income and excluded from earnings 
realized gains and losses and declines in fair value judged to be other than temporary are included in earnings 
the fair value of investments is discussed in more detail in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
long lived assets and intangibles 
the corporation periodically assesses the impairment of its long lived assets and intangibles using judgment as to the effects of external factors  including market conditions 
judgment is also required in projecting future operating results 
if actual external conditions and future operating results differ from the corporation s judgments  impairment charges may be necessary to reduce the carrying value of these assets to the appropriate market value 
accrued taxes 
the corporation estimates tax expense based on the amount it expects to owe various tax authorities 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
financial condition total consolidated assets for the corporation as of march   were million  a increase from the march   level of million 
this increase in assets was due primarily to the growth in loans receivable to million at march  versus million at march  this growth was primarily attributable to the growth in commercial loans during this period  as the bank continued its practice of selling most of its single family fixed rate loan production into the secondary market 
the bank sold million of real estate loans in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the bank sells real estate loans during periods of increased loan volume to improve cash flow and to manage its interest rate risk profile 
also contributing to the increase in assets was the change in investment securities  available for sale  which increased to million at march  from million at march  the tables below display the characteristics of the available for sale afs and held to maturity htm portfolios as of march  as of march  amortized net estimated cost gain loss fair value in thousands available for sale securities afs state and political subdivisions and us government agency us    marketable equity securities    mutual funds   corporate debt securities   mortgage backed securities and cmo s   total available for sale securities

shareholders equity at march  increased to million from million at march  this increase was due primarily to the increase in net income of million less dividends paid and shares repurchased 
the corporation remains strong in terms of its capital position  with a shareholder equity to assets ratio of at march   compared to at march  results of operations net interest income 
net interest income in fiscal was million  a increase from fiscal of million  compared to million in fiscal total interest income decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal interest income on loans in fiscal was million  a decrease from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decreases in fiscal and were due primarily to the overall decline in interest rates 
the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to the decrease in loans receivable resulting from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
included in these amounts for  and are approximately million  million and million  respectively  of deferred fee income as a result of loan paydowns  payoffs  and loans sold from the available for sale mortgage portfolio 
interest and dividends on investments and mortgage backed securities was million in fiscal  a decrease from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to principal paydowns in the cmo and mortgage backed securities portion of the bank s investment portfolio and an overall decline in interest rates 
the increase in fiscal was due to the overall growth in the investment portfolio compared to the prior year 
the decrease in fiscal was due in part to the sale of selected long term fixed rate mortgage backed securities during the year  which shifted a portion of the investment portfolio into liquid  short term assets with less interest rate risk 
total interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal interest on deposits decreased in fiscal to million  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decreases in fiscal  and were due to the overall decline in interest rates 
interest on borrowings increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to a higher level of borrowings outstanding of million at march  versus million at march   and million at march  the bank continues to carry wholesale borrowings in order to further leverage its balance sheet and better manage its interest rate risk profile 
provision for loan losses 
provisions for loan losses are charges to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management as adequate to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  based on management s continuing analysis of factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in portfolio size and composition  actual loss experience  current economic conditions  detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured  and determination of the existence and realizable value of the collateral and guarantees securing the loans 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended march  compared to million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
this change resulted from management s ongoing analysis of changes in loan portfolio composition by collateral categories  overall credit quality of the portfolio  peer group analysis  and current economic conditions 
the reserve for loan losses was million  or of loans receivable at march   compared to million  or of loans receivable at march  the increased allowance level resulted from continued loan portfolio growth in the higher risk lending categories of commercial and multi family construction permanent loans and business loans during the period  which comprised million  or of the portfolio at march   versus million  or at march  in addition  commercial and multi family loans have larger individual loan amounts  which have a greater single impact on the total portfolio quality in the event of delinquency or default 
the corporation considers these increased provisions to be appropriate  due to the changing portfolio mix and the uncertain regional economic environment 
northwest washington s economy has been adversely affected by a number of factors  including but not limited to slowdowns in the aerospace  technology and telecommunications industries 
as of march   there were eight loans in the loan portfolio over days delinquent and no loans on non accrual status 
at march  total non performing loans were  real estate owned at march  totaled  total non performing assets represented  or of total assets at march  compared to million  or of total assets at march  as of march  dollars in thousands non performing assets accruing loans days past due non accrual loans total non performing loans total non performing loans net loans real estate owned  total non performing assets  total non performing assets total assets 
noninterest income 
noninterest income in fiscal was million  an increase of from fiscal of million  compared to million in fiscal contributing to the increase in fiscal was the increase in services fees of to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and fiscal the primary reasons for this increase was the growth in deposits and revisions to the bank s fee schedules during the year 
the net gain or loss on sales of investment securities increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal and from  in fiscal the gains in these periods were due primarily to the sale of selected common stocks and mortgage backed securities from the afs investment portfolio 
other non interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and  in fiscal the primary reason for the increase in fiscal was the recognition of approximately  in profits through march  compared to approximately  in profits in the prior period from a real estate development joint venture of the bank s wholly owned subsidiary  westward financial services corporation 
the increase in fiscal was due to the recognition of income related to approximately million in bank owned life insurance which was acquired in late march and early april noninterest expense 
noninterest expense in fiscal increased to million  a increase from fiscal of million  compared to fiscal of million 
compensation and employee benefits increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increases in compensation and employee benefits during fiscal and were primarily due to the overall growth in employment at the corporation  including key additions to staff as the corporation continues its efforts to enhance its commercial banking expertise  along with additional staff for the lynnwood office and new commercial banking loan centers 
building occupancy expense was million in fiscal  a increase from million in fiscal and fiscal the increase in fiscal was due to the opening of our lynnwood office  three new commercial banking loan centers in bellingham  snohomish  and everett  and the expansion of the burlington office commercial center 
other noninterest expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increases in fiscal and were primarily due to the overall growth of the corporation and a decreasing mortgage servicing portfolio as a result of the increased refinance activity due to the low rate environment which results in increased amortization of the associated mortgage servicing asset 
also contributing to the increase in fiscal was an increase in business and occupation b o tax expense due to the shift in the loan portfolio from one to four family mortgages  which are exempt from b o tax  to b o taxable commercial loans 
data processing expenses decreased in fiscal to  from  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the primary reason for this decline relates to a renegotiation of the bank s contract with its core data processor which included substantial concessions in the first quarter of fiscal  and a reduced monthly expense thereafter 
subsequent to year end  the corporation entered into a five year service agreement with a third party processor for account processing services  development services and software products 
included in this agreement are system conversion services  for which the third party processor will bill the corporation on a monthly basis  as services are used and products installed 
advertising and marketing expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increases in fiscal and were due primarily to additional marketing 
in connection with the bank s expanded commercial product lines and services  the transition to a new advertising and marketing agency  and the development of a new brand strategy for the bank 
provisions for income tax 
income tax expense increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the corporation s effective tax rate was approximately in each of the past three fiscal years 
net income 
net income of million for fiscal represents a increase from net income of million for fiscal  compared to net income of million in fiscal basic earnings per share for was on weighted average shares of  compared to basic earnings per share of on weighted average shares of  in fiscal  and basic earnings per share of on weighted average shares of  in fiscal yields earned and rates paid the corporation s pre tax earnings depend primarily on its net interest income  the difference between the income it receives on the loan portfolio and other investments and its cost of money  consisting primarily of interest paid on savings deposits  and other borrowings 
net interest income is affected by i the difference between rates of interest earned on its interest earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread and ii the relative amounts of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
financial institutions have traditionally used interest rate spreads as a measure of net interest income 
another indicator of an institution s net interest income is its net interest margin which is net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
the following table presents at the date and for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income and interest expense  as well as the resulting yields earned and rates paid

as of march   the total book value of investments and mortgage backed securities was million compared to a market value of million with an unrealized gain of million 
as of march   the total book value of investments and mortgage backed securities was million compared to a market value of million with an unrealized gain of million 
the corporation foresees no factors that would impair its ability to hold debt securities to maturity 
as indicated on the corporation s consolidated statement of cash flows contained in item hereof  the corporation s primary sources of funds are cash flow from operations  which consist primarily of mortgage loan repayments  deposit increases  loan sales  borrowings  and cash received from the maturity or sale of investment securities 
the corporation s liquidity fluctuates with the supply of funds and management believes that the current level of liquidity is adequate at this time 
if additional liquidity is needed  the corporation s options include  but are not necessarily limited to selling additional loans in the secondary market  entering into reverse repurchase agreements  borrowing from the fhlb of seattle  accepting additional jumbo and or public funds deposits  or accessing the discount window of the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
shareholders equity as of march  was million  or of assets  compared to million  or of assets at march  the bank continues to exceed the minimum tier one capital required by the fdic in order to be considered well capitalized 
the bank s total risk adjusted capital ratio as of march  was  compared to as of march  these figures are well above the well capitalized minimum of set by the fdic 
the corporation has been in various buy back programs since august in march  the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase plan that runs concurrent with the fiscal year  allowing the corporation to repurchase up to of total shares outstanding  or approximately million shares 
this marked the corporation s sixth stock repurchase plan 
in fiscal  under the previous plans  the corporation repurchased  shares at an average price of 
for additional information concerning the corporation s repurchase activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  see item hereof 
management intends to continue its stock buy back programs from time to time as long as repurchasing the stock is perceived to contribute to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the number of shares of stock that will be repurchased and the price that will be paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the corporation 
the primary factors  however  are market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in the market  the number of shares available in the market  the attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment  the ability to increase the value and or earnings per share of the remaining outstanding shares  and the corporation s liquidity and capital needs and regulatory requirements 
presently  it is management s belief that purchases made under the current board approved plan will not materially affect the corporation s capital or liquidity position 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation continues to be exposed to interest rate risk  although at reduced levels compared to prior years 
currently  the corporation s assets and liabilities are not materially exposed to foreign currency or commodity price risk 
at march   the corporation had no off balance sheet derivative financial instruments  nor did it have a trading portfolio of investments 
in fiscal and fiscal  the corporation continued to improve its interest rate risk analysis efforts by outsourcing its interest rate risk modeling to a third party provider that utilizes an ips sendero model 
this model analyzes the corporation s major balance sheet components  and attempts to estimate the changes to the corporation s income statement and economic value of equity  under a variety of interest rate change scenarios 
the figures contained in the table presented below  in the quantitative disclosures about market risk section  were derived from this model 
while numerous assumptions go into this modeling  and undue reliance should not be placed on the specific results  management believes that this improved modeling will enhance its interest rate risk management efforts 
in years prior to fiscal  the corporation analyzed its interest rate sensitivity using gap analysis 
the interest rate gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period  and the interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate liabilities during the same period 
banks with a positive gap are considered asset sensitive 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest sensitive assets 
banks with a negative gap are considered liability sensitive 
regardless of the method used the more sophisticated model being used currently  or the gap analysis performed in prior years the corporation s balance sheet has historically been considered liability sensitive  due to the assumption that its liabilities primarily comprised of liquid deposit accounts and certificates of deposit would reprice more rapidly than its assets which are primarily longer term loans 
however  recent interest rate risk modeling shows that the corporation is currently moderately asset sensitive 
this is due in large part to the growth in variable rate and shorter term commercial loans on the corporation s balance sheet 
also contributing to this change is the growth in wholesale borrowings in recent years  most of which with maturities greater than three years at the time of the borrowing 
other factors  such as prepayments on mortgages and investments  the interest rate sensitivity of deposits  the overall level of interest rates  and general economic conditions can also have significant effects on the corporation s performance in a changing interest rate environment 
for example  at the end of fiscal  interest rates were near historically low levels 
as a result  the corporation s liability rates already reflect the impact of a lower rate environment 
therefore  further declines in rates would not likely result in improved profitability for the corporation 
in the past three fiscal years  the balance sheet was further diversified by adding variable rate loans  shorter term fixed rate loans  and a decreased reliance on certificates of deposits for its funding needs 
as a result of the bank s shift in focus to a community commercial bank  the balance sheet has become slightly asset sensitive 
for example  with the level of interest rates at march   and the associated prepayment assumptions in the low rate environment  interest rate risk modeling predicts moderate improvement in the bank s performance in a moderately higher rate environment 
however  as interest rates increase  prepayment assumptions can change significantly  therefore it would be inappropriate to assume that significantly higher rates would have a sustained positive effect on the bank s and the corporation s performance 
further  an increase in rates  without a corresponding increase in certain indices such as prime  would adversely affect the corporation s performance 
for example  if it becomes necessary for the corporation to increase the rates it pays to attract funds in a rising rate environment  an absence of a corresponding increase in prime would  of course  negatively affect performance 
in addition  depending on timing differences  the magnitude of various rates change in future quarters  and the composition of the corporation s balance sheet  future modeling efforts may show the corporation s returning to a liability sensitive position 
management continues to monitor these areas  in its ongoing effort to manage the corporation s interest rate risk 
effects of interest rate floors periodically  the corporation is able to establish interest rate floors on certain loans  in order to enhance the corporation s profitability 
at march   the corporation had in commercial loans tied to prime 
of these prime based loans  approximately will increase immediately when prime increases due to the lack of difference between the loan s current rate and any floors in place 
approximately of the corporation s prime based loans are at their floor  and require an increase of before floating  will float only after an increase of  require an increase of  and the balance of the prime based portfolio will float only after prime increases to 
while these floors provide an overall better return for the corporation  the information provided in this section is intended to provide additional information regarding the degree to which the corporation s earnings may be enhanced due to future increases in prime 
quantitative disclosures about market risk 
the table below represents the balances of the bank s financial instruments at march  the expected maturity categories take into consideration projected prepayment rates as well as actual amortization of principal

     other borrowings      off balance sheet items commitments to extend credit   unused lines of credit   credit card arrange ments   as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  in the event of changes in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and withdrawals from savings accounts might deviate significantly from those assumed in presenting the table 
therefore  the data presented in the table should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of actual future results 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  the corporation enters into contractual obligations that meet various business needs 
these contractual obligations include time deposits to customers  borrowings from the fhlb of seattle and lease obligations for facilities

these arrangements involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk not recognized in the consolidated statement of financial condition 
the bank makes personal  commercial  and real estate lines of credit available to customers as well as stand by letters of credit or financial guarantees 
commitments to extend credit to customers are subject to the bank s normal credit policies and are essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles generally require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
the primary impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
in a period of rapidly rising interest rates  the liquidity and maturities structures of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels 
the principal effect of inflation on earnings  as distinct from levels of interest rates  is in the area of non interest expense
