item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including but not limited to those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
background cpsi was founded in and specializes in delivering comprehensive healthcare information systems and related services to community hospitals 
our systems and services are designed to support the primary functional areas of a hospital and to enhance access to needed financial and clinical information 
our comprehensive system enables healthcare providers to improve clinical  financial and administrative outcomes 
our products and services provide solutions in key areas  including patient management  financial management  patient care and clinical  enterprise and office automation 
we sell a fully integrated  enterprise wide financial and clinical hospital information system comprised of all necessary software  hardware  peripherals  forms and office supplies  together with comprehensive customer service and support 
we also offer outsourcing services  including electronic billing submissions  patient statement processing and business office functions  as part of our overall information system solution 
our system currently is installed and operating in over hospitals in states and the district of columbia 
our customers historically have consisted of community hospitals with or fewer acute care beds 
however  we also serve and are targeting for growth the market consisting of hospitals with to acute care beds 
overview we have achieved a compounded annual growth rate in revenues of approximately over the past five years 
we did not achieve this growth rate in  which we believe is the result of factors that affected our industry 
was a notably difficult year financially for community hospitals for several reasons  including a weak medicare and medicaid reimbursement environment  high salary costs due to a nationwide shortage of clinical professionals such as nurses and pharmacists  and lower than anticipated patient admissions 
the difficult year for our target market led to a challenging year for cpsi 
many hospitals delayed making significant information technology purchases due to lack of available capital 
although we added a record new hospital clients in ordinarily a positive performance indicator  most hospitals approved purchases for the minimum amount of software needed to begin the installation of an integrated system 
these smaller purchases caused the size of our average installation contract another key performance indicator for our business to decrease from approximately  in to approximately  in despite this challenging environment  we had another successful year financially 
our gross revenues increased ten percent over  while our bottom line remained constant 
cash flow from operations and total cash collections reached record highs  eclipsing net income and gross revenues  respectively  for the year 
we continue to believe that our strong cash performance reflects both the quality of our customer service and our conservative revenue recognition practices 
also  our 
table of contents win rate in competing against other companies for sales to new hospitals continued to be very strong in  exceeding the rate we achieved in this is a key performance indicator that we look at in assessing the strength of our business from a competitive standpoint  and our results in strongly support the confidence we have in our business and the quality of the products and services we offer 
as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  community hospitals are looking forward to substantially improved medicare reimbursement beginning in in the past  medicare s payment formula has created a disproportionate burden on smaller  community based hospitals  which also typically depend on medicare for a greater share of their payer mix than larger  urban facilities 
the new medicare legislation rectifies some of this imbalance  raising medicare reimbursements to rural hospitals by an estimated billion over the next ten years 
we believe that once community hospitals begin to feel the financial effects of this legislation  we will be in a good position to continue to grow our business 
revenues system sales 
revenues from system sales are derived from the sale of information systems including software  conversion and installation services  hardware  peripherals  forms and office supplies to new customers and from the sale of new or additional products to existing customers 
we do not record revenue upon execution of a sales contract 
upon signing a contract to purchase a system from us  each customer pays a non refundable deposit that is recorded as deferred revenue 
the customer then pays of the purchase price for the software and the related installation  training and conversion when we install the system and commence training on site at the customer s facility  which is likewise recorded as deferred revenue 
when the system begins operating in a live environment  the remaining of the system purchase price is payable  and we recognize revenue for the total amount of the purchase price for software and related services 
revenues derived from installation of additional software applications are generally recognized upon installation 
revenues from the sale of hardware  forms and supplies are recognized upon the shipment of the product to the customer 
support and maintenance 
we also derive revenues from the provision of system support services  including software application support  hardware maintenance  continuing education and related services 
support services are provided pursuant to a support agreement under which we provide comprehensive system support and related services in exchange for a monthly fee based on the services provided 
the initial term of these contracts ranges from one to seven years  with a typical duration of five years 
upon expiration of the initial term  these contracts renew automatically from year to year thereafter until terminated 
revenues from support services are recognized in the month when these services are performed 
we provide our products to some customers as an application service provider  or asp 
we provide asp services on a remote access basis by storing and maintaining servers at our headquarters which contain customers patient and administrative data 
these customers then access this data remotely in exchange for a monthly fee 
in addition  as part of our total information solution  we also serve as an internet service provider  or isp  for some of our customers for a monthly fee 
we also provide web site design and hosting services if needed 
revenues from our asp and isp services are recognized in the month when these services are delivered 
outsourcing revenues 
we began offering outsourcing services in january revenues from outsourcing services have increased rapidly since that time 
we expect outsourcing revenues to continue to grow at a faster rate than our systems and services revenues 
our outsourcing services include electronic billing  statement processing and business office outsourcing primarily accounts receivable 
table of contents management 
all of these outsourcing services are sold pursuant to one year customer agreements  with automatic one year renewals until terminated 
revenues from outsourcing services are recognized when these services are performed 
costs of sales system sales 
the principal costs associated with the design  development  sale and installation of our systems are employee salaries  benefits  travel expenses and certain other overhead expenses 
for the sale of equipment we incur costs to acquire these products from the respective distributors or manufacturers  as the case may be 
costs are deferred and recognized as an expense at the time the related revenues are recognized on a completed contract basis 
however  at december   and  no system sales related costs were deferred as all contracts were deemed to be substantially complete  or such amounts were not considered to be material 
support and maintenance 
the principal costs associated with our system support and maintenance services are employee salaries  benefits and certain other overhead expenses 
costs are expensed as incurred and are not deferred 
we have the same employee groups providing both system installations and support and maintenance services 
salary related expenses are allocated between cost of system sales and cost of support and maintenance services based upon an estimate of the percentage of time employees spend performing each function 
outsourcing 
the principal cost related to our statement outsourcing is postage 
the principal costs related to our electronic billing outsourcing are employee related expenses  such as salaries and benefits  and long distance telecommunication fees 
supplies and forms are additional significant costs associated with our outsourcing services 
costs are expensed as incurred and are not deferred

we have also experienced increased expenses of million in professional fees  investor relations and directors fees  which resulted from becoming a public company 
as a result of the foregoing factors  income before taxes increased by or million to million for from million for liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
this cash reserve plus cash generated from our normal operating activities should be adequate to fund our business for the foreseeable future 
our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities has been used primarily to fund the growth in our business and  prior to our ipo  to pay s corporation distributions to our stockholders 
we paid cash distributions to our pre ipo stockholders in the aggregate amounts of million  million and million in  and 
table of contents  respectively 
because of our strong cash position  our board of directors decided to begin paying a quarterly dividend in  and we declared and paid dividends in the aggregate amount of million 
we believe that paying dividends is an effective way of providing an investment return to our stockholders and a beneficial use of our cash 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to was primarily related to an increase in accounts receivable 
in  we experienced significant improvement in our cash collections  which produced a meaningful increase in our cash from operating activities 
upon the completion of our ipo  we converted from an s corporation to a c corporation for tax purposes 
as a result  some of our cash provided by our operating activities is now required to pay taxes on our income

we also retired outstanding long term debt in the amount of million 
during  we used cash primarily to pay cash distributions to our stockholders 
our days sales outstanding for the years  and were  and respectively 
we currently do not have a bank line of credit or other credit facility in place 
because we have no debt  we will not be subject to contractual restrictions or other influences on our operations  such as payment demands and restrictions on the use of operating funds that are typically associated with debt 
if we borrow money in the future  we will likely be subject to operating and financial covenants that could limit our ability to operate as profitably as we have in the past 
defaults under applicable loan agreements could result in the demand by lenders for immediate payment of substantial funds and substantial restrictions on expenditures  among other things

critical accounting policies general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we are required to make some estimates and judgments that affect the preparation of these financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  but actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

determination of criteria and are based on our judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 

table of contents backlog backlog consists of revenues we reasonably expect to recognize over the next twelve months under existing contracts 
the revenues to be recognized may relate to a combination of one time fees for system sales  and recurring fees for support  outsourcing  asp and isp services

table of contents in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to transactions entered into prior to february  in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established

risk factors market factors may cause a decline in spending for information technology and services by our current and prospective customers which may result in less demand for our products  lower prices and  consequently  lower revenues and a lower revenue growth rate 
the purchase of our information system involves a significant financial commitment by our customers 
at the same time  the healthcare industry faces significant financial pressures that could adversely affect overall spending on healthcare information technology and services 
for example  the balanced budget act of has significantly reduced medicare reimbursements to hospitals  leaving them less money to invest in infrastructure 
moreover  a general economic decline could cause hospitals to reduce or eliminate information technology related spending 
to the extent spending for healthcare 
table of contents information technology and services declines or increases slower than we anticipate  demand for our products and services  as well as the prices we charge  could be adversely affected 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase or maintain our revenues or our growth rate 
there are a limited number of hospitals in our target market 
continued consolidation in the healthcare industry could result in the loss of existing customers  a reduction in our potential customer base and downward pressure on our products prices 
there are a finite number of small and midsize hospitals with or fewer acute care beds 
saturation of this market with our products or our competitors products could eventually limit our revenues and growth 
furthermore  many healthcare providers have consolidated to create larger healthcare delivery enterprises with greater market power 
if this consolidation continues  we could lose existing customers and could experience a decrease in the number of potential purchasers of our products and services 
the loss of existing and potential customers due to industry consolidation could cause our revenue growth rate to decline 
in addition  larger  consolidated enterprises could have greater bargaining power  which may lead to downward pressure on the prices for our products and services 
we may experience fluctuations in quarterly financial performance that cause us to fail to meet revenues or earnings expectations 
failure to meet these expectations could adversely impact our stock price 
there is no assurance that consistent quarterly growth in our business will continue 
our quarterly revenues may fluctuate and may be difficult to forecast for a variety of reasons 
for example  prospective customers often take significant time evaluating our system and related services before making a purchase decision 
moreover  a prospective customer who has placed an order for our system could decide to cancel that order or postpone installation of the ordered system 
if a prospective customer delays or cancels a scheduled system installation during any quarter  we may not be able to schedule a substitute system installation during that quarter 
the amount of revenues that would have been generated from that installation will be postponed or lost 
the possibility of delays or cancellations of scheduled system installations could cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate 
the following factors may also affect demand for our products and services and cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate changes in customer budgets and purchasing priorities  market acceptance of new products  product enhancements and services from us and our competitors  product and price competition  and delay of revenue recognition to future quarters due to an increase in the sale of our remote access asp services 
variations in our quarterly revenues may adversely affect our operating results 
in each fiscal quarter  our expense levels  operating costs and hiring plans are based on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed 
if our actual revenues fall below expectations  our earnings will also likely fail to meet expectations 
if we fail to meet the revenue or earnings expectations of securities analysts and investors  then the price of our common stock will likely decrease 

table of contents competition with companies that have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have could result in loss of customers and or a lowering of prices for our products  causing a decrease in our revenues and or market share 
our principal competitors are meditech and hms 
meditech and hms compete with us directly in our target market of small and midsize hospitals 
these companies offer products and services that are comparable to our system and are designed to address the needs of community hospitals 
our secondary competitors include mckesson corporation  quadramed corp  cerner corporation  and siemens corporation 
these companies are significantly larger than we are  and they typically sell their products and services to larger hospitals outside of our target market 
however  they sometimes compete directly with us 
we also face competition from providers of practice management systems  general decision support and database systems and other segment specific applications  as well as from healthcare technology consultants 
any of these companies as well as other technology or healthcare companies could decide at any time to specifically target hospitals within our target market 
a number of existing and potential competitors are more established than we are and have greater name recognition and financial  technical and marketing resources 
products of our competitors may have better performance  lower prices and broader market acceptance than our products 
we expect increased competition that could cause us to lose customers  lower our prices to remain competitive and experience lower revenues  revenue growth and profit margins 
our failure to develop new products or enhance current products in response to market demands could adversely impact our competitive position and require substantial capital resources to correct 
the needs of hospitals in our target market are subject to rapid change due to government regulation  trends in clinical care practices and technological advancements 
as a result of these changes  our products may quickly become obsolete or less competitive 
new product introductions and enhancements by our competitors that more effectively or timely respond to changing industry needs may weaken our competitive position 
we continually redesign and enhance our products to incorporate new technologies and adapt our products to ever changing hardware and software platforms 
often we face difficult choices regarding which new technologies to adopt 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological advancements  or experience significant delays in product development or introduction  our competitive position could be negatively affected 
moreover  our failure to offer products acceptable to our target market could require us to make significant capital investments and incur higher operating costs to redesign our products  which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results 
potential regulation of our products as medical devices by the us food and drug administration could increase our costs  delay the introduction of new products and slow our revenue growth 
the us food and drug administration  or the fda  is likely to become more active in regulating the use of computer software for clinical purposes 
the fda has increasingly regulated computer products and computer assisted products as medical devices under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
if the fda regulates any of our products as medical devices  we would likely be required to  among other things seek fda clearance by demonstrating that our product is substantially equivalent to a device already legally marketed  or obtain fda approval by establishing the safety and effectiveness of our product  
table of contents comply with rigorous regulations governing pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacture  distribution  labeling and promotion of medical devices  and comply with the food  drug and cosmetic act s general controls  including establishment registration  device listing  compliance with good manufacturing practices and reporting of specified device malfunctions and other adverse device events 
we anticipate that some of our products currently in development will be subject to fda regulation 
if any of our products fail to comply with fda requirements  we could face fda refusal to grant pre market clearance or approval of products  withdrawal of existing clearances and approvals  fines  injunctions or civil penalties  recalls or product corrections  production suspensions  and criminal prosecution 
fda regulation of our products could increase our operating costs  delay or prevent the marketing of new or existing products and adversely affect our revenue growth 
governmental regulations relating to patient confidentiality and other matters could increase our costs 
state and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released 
these regulations may require the users of such information to implement security measures 
regulations governing electronic health data transmissions are also evolving rapidly  and they are often unclear and difficult to apply 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  requires  among other things  the secretary of health and human services  or hhs  to adopt national standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information 
hhs s health data privacy regulations restrict the use and disclosure of personally identifiable health information without the prior informed consent of the patient 
in addition  hhs has also issued final regulations establishing national standards for some healthcare related electronic transactions and uniform code sets to be used in those transactions 
although these regulations were to be effective in october  cms is currently allowing providers and payers to continue utilizing non compliant transaction code sets 
the length of this grace period has not yet been determined 
in february  hhs issued final rules with respect to information security that would require healthcare providers to implement organizational practices to protect the security of electronically maintained or transmitted health related information  such as the use of electronic signatures and single sign on access to information 
customers must be in compliance with these new regulations by april hhs has also provided a final rule for employer identifiers  however no other rules  proposed or final  have yet been issued with respect to unique health identifiers for providers or patients 
we cannot predict the potential impact of proposed rules and rules that have not yet been proposed 
in addition to hipaa  other federal and or state privacy legislation may be enacted at any time 
in our support agreements with our customers  we agree to update our software applications to comply with applicable federal and state laws 
while we believe we have developed products that will comply with current hipaa and other regulatory requirements  new laws  regulations and interpretations could force us to further redesign our products 
any such product redesign could consume significant capital  research and development and other resources  which could significantly increase our operating costs 

table of contents our products assist clinical decision making and related care by capturing  maintaining and reporting relevant patient data 
if our products fail to provide accurate and timely information  our customers could assert claims against us that could result in substantial cost to us  harm our reputation in the industry and cause demand for our products to decline 
we provide products that assist clinical decision making and related care by capturing  maintaining and reporting relevant patient data 
our products could fail or produce inaccurate results due to a variety of reasons  including mechanical error  product flaws  faulty installation and or human error during the initial data conversion 
if our products fail to provide accurate and timely information  customers and or patients could sue us to hold us responsible for losses they incur from these errors 
these lawsuits  regardless of merit or outcome  could result in substantial cost to us  divert management s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products 
we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligence  errors or mistakes 
despite this precaution  such contract provisions may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions 
however  this coverage may not be sufficient to cover one or more large claims against us or otherwise continue to be available on terms acceptable to us 
in addition  the insurer could disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
breaches of security in our system could result in customer claims against us and harm to our reputation causing us to incur expenses and or lose customers 
we have included security features in our systems that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of patient data 
despite the existence of these security features  our system may experience break ins and similar disruptive problems that could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the computer networks of our customers 
because of the sensitivity of medical information  customers could sue us for breaches of security involving our system 
also  actual or perceived security breaches in our system could harm the market perception of our products which could cause us to lose existing and prospective customers 
new products that we introduce or enhancements to our existing products may contain undetected errors or problems that could affect customer satisfaction and cause a decrease in revenues 
highly complex software products such as ours sometimes contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or when updates and new versions are released 
tests of our products may not detect bugs or errors because it is difficult to simulate our customers wide variety of computing environments 
despite extensive testing  from time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our products 
defects or errors discovered in our products could cause delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications  decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with our products  cause a loss of revenue  result in legal actions by our customers and cause increased insurance costs 

table of contents our facilities are located in an area vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storms  and the occurrence of a severe hurricane  similar storm or other natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment  which could require us to cease or limit our operations 
all of our facilities and virtually all of our employees are situated on one campus in mobile  alabama  which is located on the coast of the gulf of mexico 
our facilities are vulnerable to significant damage or destruction from hurricanes and tropical storms 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including tornadoes  fires  floods and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to conduct business at our facilities could be seriously impaired or completely destroyed 
this would have adverse consequences for our customers who depend on us for system support or outsourcing services 
also  the servers of customers who use our remote access services could be damaged or destroyed in any such disaster 
this would have potentially devastating consequences to those customers 
although we have an emergency recovery plan  there can be no assurance that this plan will effectively prevent the interruption of our business due to a natural disaster 
furthermore  the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any natural disaster or other business interruption 
interruptions in our power supply and or telecommunications capabilities could disrupt our operations  cause us to lose revenues and or increase our expenses 
we currently have backup generators to be used as alternative sources of power in the event of a loss of power to our facilities 
if these generators were to fail during any power outage  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
this would have adverse consequences for our customers who depend on us for system support and outsourcing services 
any such interruption in operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue and increased insurance and other operating costs 
we also have customers for whom we store and maintain computer servers containing critical patient and administrative data 
those customers access this data remotely through telecommunications lines 
if our power generators fail during any power outage or if our telecommunications lines are severed or impaired for any reason  those customers would be unable to access their mission critical data causing an interruption in their operations 
in such event our remote access customers and or their patients could seek to hold us responsible for any losses 
we would also potentially lose those customers  and our reputation could be harmed 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified customer service and support personnel our business and operating results will suffer 
our customer service and support is a key component of our business 
most of our hospital customers have small information technology staffs  and they depend on us to service and support their systems 
future difficulty in attracting  training and retaining capable customer service and support personnel could cause a decrease in the overall quality of our customer service and support 
that decrease would have a negative effect on customer satisfaction which could cause us to lose existing customers and could have an adverse effect on our new customer sales 
the loss of customers due to inadequate customer service and support would negatively impact our ability to continue to grow our business 
we do not have employment or non competition agreements with our key personnel  and their departure could harm our future success 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the leadership and performance of our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and other executive officers 
we do not have employment or 
table of contents non competition agreements with any of our executive officers 
therefore  they may terminate their employment with us at any time and may compete against us 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have limited protection of our intellectual property and  if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  we may not be able to compete effectively 
we consider some aspects of our internal operations  products and documentation to be proprietary 
to some extent we have relied on a combination of confidentiality provisions in our customer agreements  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures to protect our intellectual property 
to date  however  we have not filed any patent applications to protect our proprietary software products 
in addition  existing copyright laws afford only limited protection 
although we attempt to control access to our intellectual property  unauthorized persons may attempt to copy or otherwise use our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult  and the steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use 
if our competitors gain access to our intellectual property  our competitive position in the industry could be damaged 
an inability to compete effectively could cause us to lose existing and potential customers and experience lower revenues  revenue growth and profit margins 
in the event our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties  our business may suffer if we are sued for infringement or if we cannot obtain licenses to these rights on commercially acceptable terms 
others may sue us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights 
many participants in the technology industry have an increasing number of patents and patent applications and have frequently demonstrated a readiness to take legal action based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement 
further  as the number and functionality of our products increase  we believe we may become increasingly subject to the risk of infringement claims 
if infringement claims are brought against us  these assertions could distract management 
we may have to spend a significant amount of money and time to defend or settle those claims 
if we were found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we could be forced to pay significant license fees or damages for infringement 
if we were unable to obtain licenses to these rights on commercially acceptable terms  we would be required to discontinue the sale of our products that contain the infringing technology 
our customers would also be required to discontinue the use of those products 
we are unable to insure against this risk on an economically feasible basis 
even if we were to prevail in an infringement lawsuit  the accompanying publicity could adversely impact the demand for our system 
under some circumstances  we agree to indemnify our customers for some types of infringement claims that may arise from the use of our products
