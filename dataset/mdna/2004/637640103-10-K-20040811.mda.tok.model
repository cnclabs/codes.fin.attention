item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this and our other reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof and disclaim any obligation to do so 
general we design  develop  manufacture and market a wide range of semiconductor products  most of which are analog and mixed signal integrated circuits 
our focus is on creating analog intensive solutions that provide more energy efficiency  portability  better audio and sharper images in electronics systems 
we target key markets such as o wireless handsets  o displays  o pcs  o networks  and o a broad range of portable applications 
our strategy is to be the premier analog company driving the information age 
combining analog and digital technology  we focus on analog based semiconductor products  which include stand alone devices and subsystems  in the areas of power management  display drivers  audio  amplifiers and data conversion 
approximately percent of our revenue in fiscal was generated from analog based products and we believe this percentage can potentially grow in the future as a result of our increasing focus on developing new analog products for a variety of markets and applications 
national was originally incorporated in the state of delaware in and our headquarters have been in santa clara  california since on our investor information website  located at www 
national 
com  we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed or furnished to the securities and exchange commission our annual report on form k  our quarterly reports on form q  our current reports on form k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section a or d of the securities exchange act of all of our filings are on our website and are available free of charge 
we also maintain certain corporate governance documents on our website  including our code of conduct and ethics  director affairs committee charter  compensation committee charter  audit committee charter and other governance policies 
we will provide a printed copy of any of these documents to any shareholder who requests it 
we do not intend for information found on our website to be part of this document 
recent highlights we began fiscal as a stronger company focused on achieving greater profitability and better return on invested capital through increased sales of our higher margin analog products 
during fiscal  we continued to follow through on profit improvement actions that were first announced in february for example  in late august  we completed the exit and sale of our information appliance business  consisting primarily of the geodetm family of integrated processor products see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
during the year  we also completed other cost reduction activities that resulted in lower r d spending for the company as a whole 
at the same time  we were able to increase our research and development investments in analog capabilities 
as a result of our actions  combined with better overall market conditions  our financial results in fiscal were substantially improved compared to fiscal during september and october  we repurchased a total of million shares post split basis of our common stock for million in connection with a stock repurchase program announced in july this program was followed by the announcement of another million stock repurchase program in march under this second program  we repurchased an additional million shares post split basis of our common stock for million through the end of fiscal these stock repurchase programs are one element of an overall effort to increase our return on invested capital  which we believe improves shareholder value 
we also completed a two for one stock split in may  which was paid in the form of a stock dividend 
we did the stock split to make our stock more affordable to the individual investor while keeping the price per share and the number of shares outstanding comparable to other leading companies in our industry 
products semiconductors are integrated circuits in which a number of transistors and other elements are combined to form a more complicated circuit or discrete devices such as individual transistors 
in an integrated circuit  various components are fabricated in a small area or chip of silicon  which is then encapsulated in plastic  ceramic or other advanced forms of packaging and connected to a circuit board or substrate 
we manufacture an extensive range of analog intensive and mixed signal integrated products  which are used in numerous applications 
while no precise industry definition exists for analog and mixed signal devices  we consider products which process or condition analog information or convert analog to digital or digital to analog as analog and mixed signal devices 
we are a leading supplier of analog and mixed signal products  serving both broad based markets such as the industrial  communications  computing  consumer and automotive markets  and more narrowly defined markets such as wireless handsets  lcd monitors  personal computers and hdtvs 
our analog and mixed signal devices include o operational and audio amplifiers  o communication interface circuits  o power monitors  converters and regulators  o radio frequency integrated circuits  o analog to digital converters  o flat panel display drivers and signal processors

imaging products group the imaging products group develops complete imaging solutions including cmos image sensors and image processors 
these solutions are aimed at applications for the mobile phone  automotive and various consumer products 
information appliance group the geodetm family of integrated processor products  the primary component of the information appliance group  was sold to amd in late august as part of our disposition of the information appliance business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about the disposition of the information appliance business 
the remainder of the information appliance operation was closed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal worldwide marketing and sales and central technology and manufacturing group separate from our business operating groups  our corporate structure includes a centralized worldwide marketing and sales group and a central technology and manufacturing group ctmg 
worldwide marketing and sales is structured around the four major regions of the world where we operate the americas  europe  japan and asia pacific and unites our worldwide sales and marketing organization 
ctmg manages all production  including manufacturing requirements that are outsourced  and central support technology 
central support technology includes process technology  which consists of research and process development necessary for many of our core production processes  packaging technology and research 
ctmg provides a range of process libraries  product cores and software that are shared among our product lines 
this group is also responsible for the selection and usage of common support tools  including integrated computer aided design for design  layout and simulation 
segment financial information and geographic information for segment reporting purposes  each of our product line business units represents an operating segment as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
business units that have similarities  including economic characteristics  underlying technology  markets and customers  are aggregated into larger segments 
under the criteria in sfas no 
 analog is our only reportable segment for fiscal the remaining business units that are not included in the analog reportable segment are grouped as all other 
for further financial information on this segment  as well as geographic information  refer to the information contained in note  segment and geographic information  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item marketing and sales we market our products globally to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers through a direct sales force 
major oems and odms include o bosch  o lg electronics  o quanta  o dell  o lm ericsson  o samsung  o hewlett packard  o matsushita  o siemens  o ibm  o motorola  o sony  and o kyocera  o nokia  o sony ericsson mobile communication 
there has been an increasing trend in the technology industry where oems use contract manufacturers to build their products and odms to design and build products 
as a result  our design wins with major oems  particularly in the personal computer and cellular phone markets  can ultimately result in sales to a third party manufacturer 
in addition to our direct sales force  we use distributors in our four business regions  and approximately percent of our fiscal net sales were generated through distributors 
in an increasing portion of our distribution sales  the distributor acts as the logistics partner for our oem customers and their contract manufacturers 
in line with industry practices  we generally credit distributors for the effect of price reductions on their inventory of our products and  under specific conditions  we repurchase products that we have discontinued 
in general  distributors do not have the right to return product 
our regional facilities in the united states  europe  japan and asia pacific handle local customer support 
these customer support centers respond to inquiries on product pricing and availability  customer technical support requests  order entry and scheduling 
we augment our sales effort with application engineers based in the field 
these engineers are specialists in our product portfolio and work with customers to identify and design our integrated circuits into customers products and applications 
these engineers also help identify emerging markets for new products and are supported by our design centers in the field or at manufacturing sites 
we also provide web based  online tools that allow customers and potential customers to select our devices  create a design using our parts  and simulate performance of that design 
customers the distributor arrow accounted for percent of our net sales in fiscal and fiscal in addition  the distributor avnet accounted for percent of our net sales in fiscal  and approximately percent of our net sales in fiscal and fiscal although we do not have any other customers with sales greater than percent  we do have several large customers that manufacture and market wireless handsets  among other electronic products 
these customers typically purchase a variety of different products from us 
if any one of these customers were to cease all purchases from us within a very short timeframe  such as within one quarter  it could have a negative impact on our financial results for that period 
however  we have not had any such experience to date 
backlog in accordance with industry practice  we frequently revise semiconductor backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders to reflect changes in customer needs 
we rarely formally enforce binding agreements for the sale of specific quantities at specific prices that are contractually subject to price or quantity revisions  consistent with industry practice 
for these reasons  we do not believe it is meaningful to disclose the amount of backlog at any particular date 
seasonality we are affected by the seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries 
we typically experience sequentially lower sales in our first and third fiscal quarters  primarily due to customer vacation and holiday schedules 
sales usually reach a seasonal peak in our fourth fiscal quarter 
sales in fiscal were basically consistent with these trends  except that sales for our third fiscal quarter were higher than the second fiscal quarter 
although the third fiscal quarter in fiscal included calendar weeks rather than the normal weeks  sales in our third fiscal quarter measured on a normalized basis still grew slightly over sales in the second fiscal quarter 
manufacturing the design of semiconductor and integrated circuit products is shaped by general market needs and customer requirements 
following product design and development  we produce integrated circuits in the following steps o wafer fabrication 
product designs are compiled and digitized by state of the art design equipment and then transferred to silicon wafers in a series of complex precision processes that include oxidation  lithography  chemical etching  diffusion  deposition  implantation and metallization 
o wafer sort 
the silicon wafers are tested and separated into individual circuit devices 
o product assembly 
tiny wires are used to connect the electronic circuits on the device to the stronger metal leads of the package in which the device is encapsulated for protection 
o final test 
the devices are subjected to a series of vigorous tests using computerized circuit testers and  for certain applications  environmental testers such as burn in ovens  centrifuges  temperature cycle or moisture resistance testers  salt atmosphere testers and thermal shock testers 
o coating 
certain devices in the analog portfolio are designed to be used without traditional packaging 
in this case  the integrated circuit is coated with a protective material and mounted directly onto the circuit board 
wafer fabrication is concentrated in two facilities in the united states and one in scotland 
nearly all product assembly and final test operations are performed in two facilities in southeast asia 
an additional assembly and test facility in china that began construction in fiscal as part of our effort to increase assembly and test capacity was nearly completed by the end of fiscal and will be operational in fiscal we use subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing functions in the united states  europe  israel  southeast asia and japan to address capacity and other economic issues 
our wafer manufacturing processes span bipolar  metal oxide silicon  complementary metal oxide silicon and bipolar complementary metal oxide silicon technologies  including silicon germanium 
our efforts are heavily focused on processes that support our analog portfolio of products  which address wireless handsets  displays  computers and a broad variety of other electronic applications 
bipolar processes primarily support our standard products 
the width of the individual transistors on a chip is measured in microns  one micron equals one millionth of a meter 
as products decrease in size and increase in functionality  our wafer fabrication facilities must be able to manufacture integrated circuits with sub micron circuit pattern widths 
this precision fabrication carries over to assembly and test operations  where advanced packaging technology and comprehensive testing are required to address the ever increasing performance and complexity embedded in current integrated circuits 
raw materials our manufacturing processes use certain key raw materials critical to our products 
these include silicon wafers  certain chemicals and gases  ceramic and plastic packaging materials and various precious metals 
we also rely on subcontractors to supply finished or semi finished products which we then market through our sales channels 
we obtain raw materials and semi finished or finished products from various sources  although the number of sources for any particular material or product is relatively limited 
we feel our current supply of essential materials is adequate 
however  shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again 
significant increases in demand  rapid product mix changes or natural disasters could affect our ability to procure materials or goods 
research and development our research and development efforts consist of research in metallurgical  electro mechanical and solid state sciences  manufacturing process development and product design 
research and development of most process and packaging technologies are done by ctmg s process technology group 
specific product design and development is generally done in our business units 
total r d expenses were million for fiscal  or percent of net sales  compared to million for fiscal  or percent of net sales  and million for fiscal  or percent of net sales 
these amounts exclude in process r d charges of million related to the acquisition of digitalquake in fiscal and million related to the acquisitions of fincitec  arsmikro and wireless solutions sweden in fiscal these in process r d charges are included in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of special items 
total company spending through fiscal for new product development was down percent  and for process and support technology was down percent from fiscal primarily because of expenses we eliminated in the business areas we have exited 
although research and development spending was down as a whole and as a percentage of sales  research and development spending for our analog segment increased as we continue to invest in the development of our analog capabilities to address a variety of markets 
a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
patents we own numerous united states and non us patents and have many patent applications pending 
we consider the development of patents and the maintenance of an active patent program advantageous to the conduct of our business 
however  we believe that continued success will depend more on engineering  production  marketing  financial and managerial skills than on our patent program 
we license certain of our patents to other manufacturers and participate in a number of cross licensing arrangements and agreements with other parties 
each license agreement has unique terms and conditions  with variations as to length of term  royalties payable  permitted uses and scope 
the majority of these agreements are cross licenses in which we grant a broad license to our intellectual property in exchange for receiving a similar corresponding license from the other party  and none are exclusive 
the amount of income we have received from licensing agreements has varied in the past  and we cannot precisely forecast the amount and timing of future income from licensing agreements 
on an overall basis  we believe that no single license agreement is material to us  either in terms of royalty payments due or payable or intellectual property rights granted or received 
employees at may   we employed approximately  people of whom approximately  were employed in the united states   in europe   in southeast asia and in other areas 
we believe that our future success depends fundamentally on our ability to recruit and retain skilled technical and professional personnel 
our employees in the united states are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations worldwide to be favorable 
competition competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
with our focus on analog  our major competitors include analog devices  linear technology  maxim  st microelectronics and texas instruments that sell competing products into some of the same markets that we target 
in some cases  we may also compete with our customers 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products and markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
environmental regulations to date  our compliance with foreign  federal  state and local laws or regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  competitive or financial position 
for more information  see item  legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item however  we could be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of our operations if we fail to comply with present or future statutes and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
item properties we conduct manufacturing  as well as process research and product development  in our wafer fabrication facilities located in arlington  texas  south portland  maine  and greenock  scotland 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization during fiscal was percent  based on wafer starts  compared to percent for fiscal when production activity was lower under weaker business conditions 
we expect our captive manufacturing capacity together with our third party subcontract manufacturing arrangements to be adequate to supply our needs in the foreseeable future 
our assembly and test functions are performed primarily in southeast asia 
these facilities are located in melaka  malaysia and toa payoh  singapore 
the construction of an assembly and test facility in suzhou  china that was begun in fiscal as part of our effort to increase assembly and test capacity will be operational in fiscal our principal administrative and research facilities are located in santa clara  california 
our regional headquarters for worldwide marketing and sales are located in santa clara  california  munich  germany  tokyo  japan  and kowloon  hong kong 
we maintain local sales offices and sales service centers in various locations and countries throughout our four business regions 
we also operate small design facilities in various locations in the us  including arlington  texas  indianapolis  indiana  salem  new hampshire  calabasas  california  kirkland  washington  san diego  california  federal way  washington  norcross  georgia  santa clara  california  fort collins  colorado  phoenix  arizona  south portland  maine  grass valley  california  rochester  new york  tucson  arizona  and at overseas locations including china  estonia  finland  germany  india  israel  japan  the netherlands  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we own our manufacturing facilities and our corporate headquarters 
in general  we lease most of our design facilities and our sales and administrative offices 
item legal proceedings we currently are a party to various legal proceedings  including those noted below 
while we believe that the ultimate outcome of these various proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations  litigation is always subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from selling one or more products 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs  and future periods 
tax matters the irs has completed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years through and on july  issued a notice of proposed adjustment seeking additional taxes of approximately million exclusive of interest for those years 
the issues giving rise to most of the proposed adjustments relate to r d credits  inventory and depreciation deductions 
we are contesting the adjustments through the administrative process 
we are undergoing tax audits in several international locations and from time to time our tax returns are audited in the us by state agencies and at international locations by local tax authorities 
we believe we have made adequate tax payments and or accrued adequate amounts in our financial statements to cover the amounts sought by the irs  as well as any other deficiencies that other government agencies may find in these audits 
environmental matters we have been named to the national priorities list superfund for our santa clara  california site and we have completed a remedial investigation feasibility study with the regional water quality control board  which is acting as agent for the epa 
we have agreed in principle with the rwqcb on a site remediation plan  and we are conducting remediation and cleanup efforts at the site 
in addition to the santa clara site  we have been designated from time to time as a potentially responsible party by international  federal and state agencies for certain environmental sites with which we may have had direct or indirect involvement 
these designations are made regardless of the extent of our involvement 
these claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings and include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigations and remedial actions 
in many cases  the dollar amounts of the claims have not been specified and the claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same cost recovery or other relief as is sought from us 
we have also retained liability for environmental matters arising from our former operations of dynacraft  inc and the fairchild business  but we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings relating to those liabilities 
we accrue costs associated with environmental matters when they become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of all environmental charges to earnings  including charges relating to the santa clara site remediation  excluding potential reimbursements from insurance coverage  has not been material during each of the last three fiscal years 
we believe that the potential liability for environmental matters  if any  in excess of amounts already accrued in our financial statements will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other in november  a derivative action was filed in the us district court in delaware against us  fairchild semiconductor international  inc and sterling holding company  llc  by mark levy  a fairchild stockholder 
the action was brought under section b of the securities exchange act of and the rules issued under that act by the securities and exchange commission 
the plaintiff seeks disgorgement of alleged short swing insider trading profits 
we had originally acquired fairchild common and preferred stock in march at the time we disposed of the fairchild business 
prior to its initial public offering in august  fairchild had amended its certificate of incorporation to provide that all fairchild preferred stock would convert automatically to common stock upon completion of the initial public offering 
as a result  our shares of preferred stock converted to common stock in august plaintiff has alleged that our acquisition of common stock through the conversion constituted an acquisition that should be matched against our sale in january of fairchild common stock for purposes of computing short swing trading profits 
the action seeks to recover from us on behalf of fairchild alleged recoverable profits of approximately million 
in february  the judge in the case granted the motion to dismiss filed by us and our co defendants and dismissed the case  ruling that the conversion was done pursuant to a reclassification which is exempt from the scope of section b 
plaintiff appealed the dismissal of the case and upon appeal  the us court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the district court s dismissal 
our petition for a panel rehearing and or rehearing en banc was denied by the appeals court in april our petition to the us supreme court for a writ of certiorari was denied in october the case is now proceeding in the district court where discovery has been completed  and we intend to contest it through all available means 
in january  a class action suit was filed against us and a number of our suppliers in california superior court by james harris and other former and present employees claiming damages for personal injury 
the complaint alleges that cancer and or reproductive harm were caused to employees as a result of alleged exposure to toxic chemicals while working at our company 
plaintiffs claim to have worked at sites in santa clara and or in greenock  scotland 
in addition  one plaintiff claims to represent a class of children of company employees who allegedly sustained developmental harm as a result of alleged in utero exposure to toxic chemicals while their mothers worked at the company 
although no specific amount of monetary damages is claimed  plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of the classes for personal injuries  nervous shock  physical and mental pain  fear of future illness  medical expenses and loss of earnings and earnings capacity 
the court has required the scottish employees to seek their remedies in scottish courts 
the court has also denied plaintiffs motion for certification of a medical monitoring class 
discovery in the case is proceeding and we intend to defend this action vigorously 
in april  zf micro solutions  inc brought suit against us in the california superior court alleging a number of contract and tort claims related to an agreement we entered into in to design and manufacture a custom integrated circuit device for zf micro devices 
zf micro devices ceased business operations in february and the case was brought by zf micro solutions as successor to zf micro devices 
the case began trial in may and on june   the jury in the case found for zf micro solutions on a claim on intentional misrepresentation  awarding damages of million and on a claim of breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  awarding damages of million 
on seven other claims brought by the plaintiff  the jury found for us 
the jury also found for us on our breach of contract cross claim  awarding damages of million 
we are challenging the verdicts in favor of zf micro solutions in post trial motions and intend to vigorously pursue the appeal of any judgment that may be entered against us in this matter

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements relate to  among other things  sales  gross margins  operating expenses  capital expenditures  r d efforts and acquisitions and investments in other companies and are indicated by words or phrases such as anticipate  expect  outlook  foresee  believe  could  intend  and similar words or phrases 
these statements are based on our current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations 
these forward looking statements should not be relied upon as predictions of future events as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur 
the following are among the principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements general business and economic conditions in the semiconductor industry and in various markets such as wireless  pc  displays and networks  pricing pressures and competitive factors  delays in the introduction of new products or lack of market acceptance for new products  our success in integrating acquisitions and achieving operating improvements with acquisitions  risks of international operations  legislative and regulatory changes  the outcome of legal  administrative and other proceedings that we are involved in  the results of our programs to control or reduce costs  and the general worldwide geopolitical situation 
for a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements  see the discussion on risk factors that appears below and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this and our other reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof and disclaim any obligation to do so 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto o critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies are those policies that have a significant effect on the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies also require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments a revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of semiconductor products upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated future returns at the time of shipment 
approximately percent of our semiconductor product sales were made through distributors in fiscal we have agreements with our distributors that cover various programs  including pricing adjustments based on resales  scrap allowances and volume incentives 
the revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net distribution revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based upon historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  and other related factors 
actual distributor activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results are dependent on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results 
service revenues  which are included in net sales  are recognized as the services are provided or as milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
intellectual property income is not classified as sales 
this income is classified as a component of special items in the consolidated statement of operations and is recognized when the license is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is reasonably assured and no further obligations to the other party exist 
b valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount that is the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our products are classified as either custom  which are those products manufactured with customer specified features or characteristics  or non custom  which are those products that do not have customer specified features or characteristics 
we evaluate obsolescence by analyzing the inventory aging  order backlog and future customer demand on an individual product basis 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than what we have estimated  we may be required to write inventory down below the current carrying value 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable estimates 
the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory has been materially consistent with previously estimated write downs we have recorded 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory for lower of cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are intended to identify any difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is determined as the selling price of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than what we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
c impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
other intangible assets subject to this evaluation include developed technology we have acquired  patents and technology licenses 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include o significant decrease in the market value of an asset o significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition o a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset o significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions o current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset our impairment evaluation of long lived assets includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
our impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of our reporting units with goodwill 
the fair value of a reporting unit is measured at the business unit level using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs for those business units 
reporting units with goodwill include our wireless  displays  power management and data conversion business units  which are operating segments within our analog reportable segment  and our enterprise networking and device connectivity business units  which are included in all others 
our estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
if we fail to deliver new products for these business units  or if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or market conditions for these businesses fail to sustain improvement  our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our net equity and results of operations 
d deferred income taxes we determine deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over those future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgments of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we currently have recorded 
o overview we began fiscal as a stronger company focused on achieving greater profitability and better return on invested capital through increased sales of our higher margin analog products 
during fiscal  we continued to follow through on profit improvement actions that were first announced in february for example  in late august  we completed the exit and sale of our information appliance business  consisting primarily of the geodetm family of integrated processor products see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year  we also completed other cost reduction activities that resulted in lower r d spending for the company as a whole 
at the same time  we were able to increase our research and development investments in analog capabilities 
as a result of our actions  combined with better overall market conditions  our financial results in fiscal were substantially improved compared to fiscal in reviewing our performance we consider several key financial measures 
when reviewing our net sales performance  we look at sales growth rates  new order rates including turns orders  average selling prices  revenue from new products and market share in the standard linear category as defined by world semiconductor trade statistics 
we generally define new products as those introduced within the last three years 
we gauge our operating income performance by gross margin trends  product mix  average selling prices  factory utilization rates and operating expenses relative to sales 
we are focused on generating a return on invested capital that consistently exceeds our cost of capital and is higher than what we have typically generated historically 
to improve our return on invested capital we concentrate on operating income  working capital management  capital expenditures and cash management 
operating income improvements are being driven by gross margin growth and more efficient operating expense ratios 
during september and october  we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million in connection with a stock repurchase program announced in july this program was followed by the announcement of another million stock repurchase program in march under this second program  we repurchased an additional million shares of our common stock for million through the end of fiscal these stock repurchase programs are one element of an overall effort to increase our return on invested capital  which we believe improve shareholder value 
we also completed a two for one stock split in may  which was paid in the form of a stock dividend 
we did the stock split to make our stock more affordable to the individual investor while keeping the price per share and the number of shares outstanding comparable to other leading companies in our industry and to allow for less dilution of our shareholder base as a result of our various stock plans 
the following table and discussion provides an overview of our operating results for fiscal years  and years ended may  may  may  in millions change change sales    operating income loss as a of sales net income loss as a of sales net sales were greater in fiscal than in fiscal the sales increases are attributable to both higher industry demand and our market share gains in key standard linear markets  particularly for power management products 
unit shipments for the company were up percent in fiscal from unit shipments in fiscal  while average selling prices were flat 
the improvement in net income was driven by higher gross margin on higher sales  as well as lower operating expenses 
net income for fiscal included special items of million  which include charges of million arising from a lawsuit brought against us by zf micro solutions  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements and million for the settlement of certain patent infringement claims 
special items also included a net charge of million for cost reduction actions and the exit and sale of the information appliance business completed in august see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  special items included million of net intellectual property income 
prior to fiscal  net intellectual property income was classified as non operating income 
net intellectual property income reported in prior years has been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
fiscal net income also included a million charge including a tax effect of million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in net sales for fiscal over fiscal came from higher demand  particularly from customers in our wireless handset market  as business conditions for the semiconductor industry slowly improved from those in fiscal  although general market and worldwide economic conditions were essentially flat 
unit shipments were up percent from unit shipments in fiscal  but average selling prices in fiscal were down percent from fiscal notwithstanding the net loss in fiscal  the improvement in net results compared to fiscal was primarily driven by the increase in sales in fiscal over that of fiscal net loss for fiscal included million of special items 
these special items included million for in process r d charges related to the acquisition of digitalquake see note to the consolidated financial statements and a net charge of million related to cost reduction actions see note to the consolidated financial statements  which were taken as part of our strategic profit improvement actions 
special items also included million of net intellectual property income 
the fiscal net loss also had million of charges included in r d expenses for the write down of technology licenses see the research and development section below 
o sales years ended may  may  may  in millions change change analog segment as a of sales all others as a of sales total sales    the chart above and the following discussion are based on our reportable segments described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our sales growth in fiscal was essentially all due to the analog segment 
growth in analog segment sales was driven by higher consumer demand for products such as wireless phones and notebook computers  and also because of a general trend towards increased analog semiconductor content in a variety of electronic products 
unit volume was up percent over the prior year and average selling prices for fiscal as a whole grew just slightly at percent over fiscal average selling prices were higher in the second half of fiscal  reflecting both a richer mix of products as well as actual price improvements  as we have been actively striving to increase our sales of high value  high performance analog products 
within the analog segment  sales of power management products led the growth in sales with an increase of percent from sales in fiscal where we continued to grow at a faster rate than the overall market 
the increased activity in wireless handsets largely drove the sales growth in power management products 
sales of audio  data conversion and application specific wireless including radio frequency building blocks products also contributed to the growth with increases of percent  percent and percent in fiscal  respectively  over sales in fiscal for fiscal  sales increased in all geographic regions compared to fiscal the increases were percent in japan  percent in the asia pacific region  percent in europe and percent in the americas 
sales in fiscal as a percentage of total sales remained flat at percent for the asia pacific region and percent in europe 
japan increased to percent of total sales while the americas decreased to percent 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the japanese yen  pound sterling and euro all strengthened against the dollar  but the impact on overall fiscal sales was minimal since only a quarter of our total sales was denominated in foreign currency 
the growth in analog segment sales for fiscal over fiscal came from higher volume as unit shipments increased percent from fiscal however  average selling prices declined percent from fiscal  due to a shift in product mix and some modest price declines 
the mix was impacted by increased sales of certain higher performing analog products offered in very small form factors 
although these products were relatively lower in price  within our portfolio of products  their gross margins were relatively higher 
within the analog segment  sales of audio  power management and amplifier products increased in fiscal by percent  percent and percent  respectively  from sales in fiscal sales of application specific wireless products  primarily radio frequency building blocks  were flat year on year 
for fiscal  sales increased in all geographic regions compared to fiscal the increases were percent in japan  percent in the asia pacific region  percent in europe and percent in the americas 
sales for fiscal as a percentage of total sales increased to percent for the asia pacific region and percent in japan  while decreasing to percent in the americas and percent in europe 
many of our customers have manufacturing operations in the asia pacific region that make their purchases in that region and as a result  sales increased in the asia pacific region and declined in europe and the americas 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the japanese yen  pound sterling and euro all strengthened against the dollar  but the impact on overall fiscal sales was minimal since less than a quarter of our fiscal total sales was denominated in foreign currency 
o gross margin years ended may  may  may  in millions change change sales    cost of sales gross margin  as a of sales the increase in gross margin for fiscal over fiscal was driven by a combination of higher factory utilization and improvement in product mix 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization during fiscal was percent  based on wafer starts  compared to percent for fiscal as discussed in the sales section above  our product mix has improved through active efforts to increase the portion of our business that comes from high value  higher performance analog products  which are more proprietary in nature and can generate higher margins than products that are less proprietary or are multi sourced 
analog segment sales grew to percent of total sales in fiscal from percent of total sales in fiscal  which also positively impacts our gross margins because our analog products generally have higher margins than non analog products 
the increase in gross margin for fiscal over fiscal was primarily driven by higher factory utilization 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization during fiscal was percent  compared to percent in fiscal when production activity was much lower due to weaker business conditions 
improvement in overall product mix and lower manufacturing costs in fiscal also offset an unfavorable impact on gross margin coming from actual price declines on selected products 
o research and development years ended may  may  may  in millions change change research and development as a of sales research and development expenses shown in the table above exclude in process r d charges of million in fiscal and million in fiscal lower research and development expenses in fiscal from fiscal reflect the impact of actions we initially launched in february to reduce our research and development expenses as a percentage of sales 
these actions included exits of businesses  headcount reductions and restructuring of a licensing agreement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company 
ongoing research and development spending is heavily focused on our analog products and our underlying analog capabilities 
total company spending through fiscal for new product development was down percent  and for process and support technology was down percent from fiscal primarily because of the business areas we exited 
although research and development spending is down as a whole and as a percentage of sales  research and development spending for our analog segment increased as we continue to invest in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for wireless handsets  displays  notebook pcs  other portable devices  as well as applications for the broader markets requiring analog technology 
a significant portion of our research and development is directed at power management technology 
r d expenses for fiscal included million of charges for the writedown of technology licenses 
of this total  million came from the technology license with tsmc that was impaired when we restructured the agreement and entered into a new agreement to use tsmc as our supplier of wafers for products with feature sizes of micron and below 
in addition  we reached alternative arrangements with two other r d partners that led to the impairment of additional technology licenses for the remaining million charge 
excluding these charges  r d expenses in fiscal were lower by percent from expenses in fiscal the lower r d expenses reflected our effort to control the level of expenditures  in light of weak business conditions 
o selling  general and administrative years ended may  may  may  in millions change change selling  general and administrative as a of sales the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal over fiscal were consistent with increased business levels and were mainly due to higher costs in fiscal related to employee compensation and benefits  as well as incremental costs for outside services 
although sales levels increased substantially in the last three quarters of fiscal  we are continuing to focus on controlling our cost structure in a way that allows sales to rise faster than expenses 
as a result  sg a expenses as a percent of sales declined from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal and were down to percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal the overall increase in sg a expenses for fiscal over expenses for fiscal was mainly due to higher payroll and employee benefit expenses 
the expenses for fiscal also reflect higher expenses from foreign currency remeasurement losses of million compared to a million net gain in fiscal o cost reduction programs and restructuring of operations during fiscal  we substantially completed the cost reduction activities related to our strategic profit improvement actions that were initially launched in february these actions included the exit and sale of our information appliance business  consisting primarily of the geodetm family of integrated processor products  and other cost reduction activities that were also aimed at improving profitability 
as a result  we recorded a net charge of million in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges  as well as a discussion of activity during fiscal related to previously announced actions 
o charge for acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition during fiscal of digitalquake  inc  we allocated million of the total purchase price to the value of in process r d 
in connection with our acquisitions during fiscal of the combined companies of fincitec oy and arsmikro ou  and separately of wireless solutions sweden ab  million and million of the total purchase price for each acquisition were respectively allocated to the value of in process r d 
these amounts were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative uses existed for the technologies 
for more specific information on each acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
o interest income and interest expense years ended may  may  may  in millions interest income interest expense interest income  net the decrease in interest income  net for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower average interest rates on lower average cash balances in fiscal although we generated positive cash flow from operations  our cash balances in fiscal are lower mainly as a result of the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million 
offsetting interest expense was lower during fiscal compared to fiscal as we continued to reduce our outstanding debt 
the decrease in net interest income for fiscal was due to lower average interest rates on slightly higher average cash balances during fiscal compared to fiscal offsetting interest expense was lower for fiscal as we continued to reduce our outstanding debt balances 
o other income expense  net years ended may  may  may  in millions share in net losses of equity method investments net gain loss on marketable and other investments  net other total other income expense  net the components of our other income expense  net are primarily derived from activities related to our investments 
net gain on investments for fiscal was primarily from the sale of shares in two nonpublicly traded companies upon their acquisitions by third parties 
net loss on investments in fiscal was the result of impairment losses for other than temporary declines in fair value of nonmarketable investments that more than offset gains from the sale of marketable investments 
net gain on investments in fiscal was primarily from the sale of marketable investments 
our share in net losses of equity method investments was lower in fiscal as we had fewer equity method investments in nonpublic companies than in fiscal o income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal on income before taxes and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
this compares to income tax expense of million in fiscal and an income tax benefit of million in fiscal when in both years our income before taxes was much lower than in fiscal the annual effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately percent 
fiscal tax expense consisted primarily of us income tax  net of net operating losses and tax credits  and us income taxes 
the fiscal tax expense primarily represented non us income taxes on international income 
the fiscal tax benefit consisted of million for the expected refund of us taxes as a result of a change in the federal tax law  which was mostly offset by million of tax expenses on international income 
our ability to realize net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these tax assets  but it is possible that we will be unable to do so and therefore unable to realize the benefits of recognized tax assets 
this could result in future charges to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
o foreign operations our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities is denominated in local currency  which exposes us to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities during fiscal was concentrated in uk pound sterling  singapore dollar and malaysian ringgit 
bringing our assembly and test facility in china into operation during fiscal may add some risk from chinese rmb exchange rate fluctuations in the future 
where practical  we hedge net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
our exposure from foreign currency denominated revenue is limited to the japanese yen and the euro 
we hedge up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency  using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is at times hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
at some of our international locations  we maintain defined benefit pension plans that are operated in accordance with local statutes and practices 
as required by the pension accounting standards  we record an adjustment for minimum pension liability to adjust the liability related to one of these plans to equal the amount of the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
for fiscal  the adjustment was million and a corresponding amount is reflected in the consolidated financial statements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
this adjustment decreased the unfunded benefit obligation from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the improvement in the funding status of this plan was mainly due to the increase in the value of the plan s assets  since the value of the plan s accumulated benefit obligation increased slightly with an additional year s accrual for pension liabilities and an increase in the average age of plan participants 
as we have done in the past  we will continue to fund the plan in the future to adequately meet the minimum funding requirements under local statutes 
o financial market risks we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
due to the short term nature of the major portion of our cash portfolio  a series of severe cuts in interest rates does have a significant impact on the amount of interest income we earn from our cash portfolio 
an increase in interest rates benefits us due to our large net cash position 
an increase in interest rates would not necessarily immediately increase interest expense due to the fixed rates of our existing debt obligations 
a substantial majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  euro and certain other asian currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established programs to hedge our exposure to these changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in all currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our balances as of may  o liquidity and capital resources years ended may  may  may  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash used by provided by financing activities the primary factors contributing to the changes in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  and are described below in fiscal  cash was generated from operating activities primarily from net income  adjusted for noncash items primarily depreciation and amortization  net of the negative impact that came from changes in working capital components 
these changes in working capital components were mainly driven by the overall higher levels of business activity in fiscal we also generated cash from operating activities in fiscal because the positive impact from the net loss  when adjusted for noncash items primarily depreciation and amortization  was greater than the negative impact from changes in working capital components 
in fiscal  we generated operating cash because the noncash components of our net loss  primarily depreciation and amortization  were greater than the reported net loss and the negative impact from changes in working capital components 
major uses of cash for investing activities during fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for machinery and equipment  net purchases of available for sale securities of million and payments for security deposits on leased equipment of million 
major uses of cash for investing activities for fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for machinery and equipment  the acquisition of digitalquake for million  net of cash acquired see note to the consolidated financial statements and investment in nonpublicly traded companies of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the net sale and maturity of marketable securities of million 
major uses of cash in fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  net purchases of available for sale securities of million and the acquisitions of fincitec oy  arsmikro ou and wireless solutions sweden ab for a total of million  net of cash acquired see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the primary use of cash from our financing activities in fiscal came from our repurchase of a total million shares of our common stock for million  net advances of million to acquire our common stock and payments of million on software license obligations 
a portion million shares of the stock repurchase was transacted directly with a major financial institution and the remainder in the open market 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
the primary source of cash from financing activities during fiscal came from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans of million  which was partially offset by payments of million on software license obligations and a million repayment of our outstanding debt balances 
the primary source of cash in fiscal came from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans in the amount of million  which was partially offset by repayment of million of our outstanding debt balances and payments of million on software license obligations 
in march  we announced that the board of directors approved another million stock repurchase program similar to the million stock repurchase program completed in september and october the new stock repurchase program is consistent with our current business model which focuses on higher value analog products and  therefore  is less capital intensive than it has been historically 
this stock repurchase program is one element of an overall effort to increase our return on invested capital  which we believe improves shareholder value 
as of the end of fiscal  the approved repurchase program in place allows for million of future common stock repurchases 
we foresee continuing cash outlays for plant and equipment in fiscal  with our primary focus on extending our analog capacity and capabilities at our existing sites 
the construction of an assembly and test facility in china that was begun in fiscal as part of our effort to increase assembly and test capacity is close to completion and will be operational in fiscal we currently expect our fiscal capital expenditure amount to be in a similar range as the fiscal amount 
however  we continue to manage capital expenditures within our targeted goals for return on invested capital and in light of business conditions 
we expect existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit  to be sufficient to finance planned capital investments in fiscal  as well as the stock repurchase program 
our cash and investment balances are dependent on continued collection of customer receivables and the ability to sell inventories 
although we have not experienced major problems with our customer receivables  significant declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of customer receivables 
in addition  major declines in financial markets would likely cause reductions in our cash equivalents and marketable investments 
the following table provides a summary of the effect on liquidity and cash flows from our contractual obligations as of may  fiscal year and in millions thereafter total contractual obligations debt obligations accrued software license obligations noncancelable operating leases purchase obligations under fairchild manufacturing agreement other total commercial commitments standby letters of credit under bank multicurrency agreement in addition  as of may   capital purchase commitments were million 
o outlook although overall economic conditions continue to be somewhat difficult to predict  demand levels throughout fiscal strengthened as we saw market conditions in the semiconductor industry improve from a year ago 
new orders received during fiscal were stronger than originally expected and higher than in the preceding year 
new orders also increased at a faster rate than sales  as a result of stronger order patterns in our distribution channels  which tend to serve broader markets beyond wireless handset and pcs 
new orders from our top oem customers  which include several major wireless handset manufacturers  strengthened significantly in the second half of the fiscal year 
our opening week backlog entering the first quarter of fiscal was higher than it was when we began the fourth quarter of fiscal however  we anticipate turns orders  which are orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter  to be seasonally lower in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the level in the fourth quarter 
this is consistent with what we have typically experienced in our august quarter in previous years 
our experience has been that orders usually start slow at the beginning of summer and pick up later in the quarter in preparation for increased manufacturing activity that usually occurs in the latter part of the calendar year 
considering all factors  including those discussed above  we expect sales for the first quarter of fiscal to decline percent to percent from the level achieved in our fiscal fourth quarter 
this is down from the original range we expected at the time we announced our fourth quarter earnings on june  since we have seen a more significant decrease in turns orders to date than originally anticipated 
however  if backlog orders are cancelled or if the currently anticipated level of turns orders is not received  actual revenues may be lower 
we anticipate our gross margin percentage in the first quarter of fiscal to be comparable to our fiscal fourth quarter 
our operating expenses  consisting of research and development and selling  general and administrative  have benefited from the significant actions we have taken since fiscal when we initially launched a strategic profit improvement plan 
this is partially offset by incremental programs aimed at analog growth markets 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we anticipate operating expenses to be comparable to fiscal fourth quarter levels 
we expect our investment in property  plant and equipment in total for fiscal to be slightly higher than fiscal see liquidity and capital resources 
o risk factors conditions inherent in the semiconductor industry cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and integrated products characterize the semiconductor industry 
the result is a cyclical environment with short product life cycles  price erosion and high sensitivity to the overall business cycle 
substantial capital and r d investment are also required to support products and manufacturing processes 
we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
shifts in product mix toward  or away from  higher margin products can also have a significant impact on our operating results 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our business will be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets 
competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
our major competitors include analog devices  linear technology  maxim  st microelectronics and texas instruments that sell competing products into some of the same markets that we target 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products  markets and customers 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
we may also compete with some of our customers in certain markets  such as displays and wireless handsets 
the wireless handset market continues to be important to our future growth plans 
new products are being developed to address new features and functionality in handsets  such as color displays  advanced audio  lighting features and image capture 
due to high levels of competition  as well as complex technological requirements  there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in this targeted market 
although the worldwide handset market is large  near term growth trends are uncertain and difficult to predict with accuracy 
if development of new products is delayed or market acceptance is below expectations  future operating results may be unfavorably affected 
we believe that continued focused investment in research and development  especially the timely development and market acceptance of new analog products  is a key factor to our successful growth and our ability to achieve strong financial performance 
successful development and introduction of new products are critical to our ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
we will continue to invest resources to develop more highly integrated solutions and building block products  both primarily based on our analog capabilities 
these products will continue to be targeted towards applications such as wireless handsets  displays  notebook pcs  other portable devices and other applications that require analog 
investments and acquisitions 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments and alliances and acquisitions we consider necessary to gain access to key technologies that we believe augment our existing technical capability  and support our business model objectives which includes gross margin  operating margin  and return on invested capital objectives 
acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties that may unfavorably impact our future financial performance 
we may not be able to integrate and develop the technologies we acquire as expected 
if the technology is not developed in a timely manner  we may be unsuccessful in penetrating target markets 
in addition  with any acquisition there are risks that future operating results may be unfavorably affected by acquisition related costs  including in process r d charges and incremental r d spending 
expansion of our business in the asian markets 
as noted in our discussion of planned capital expenditures  as part of our efforts to expand our business presence in the asian markets  we began construction during fiscal of an assembly and test facility in china s suzhou industrial park in the jiangsu province of china 
construction of the facility is close to completion and it is expected to be operational in fiscal we expect the facility to provide analog products quickly and cost effectively to our customers in asia  as well as other regions as necessary 
the facility will also increase our overall assembly and test capacity to support increasing product volume 
product volume increases are dependent upon customer demand 
if our product volume does not increase  lower factory utilization  which results in higher manufacturing cost per unit  will unfavorably impact operating results 
in addition  unexpected start up expenses  inefficiencies and delays in the start of production in the facility may reduce expected future gross margin 
we face risks from our international operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations outside the united states  and our business is subject to risks associated with many factors beyond our control 
these factors include fluctuations in foreign currency rates  instability of foreign economies  emerging infrastructures in foreign markets  support required abroad for demanding manufacturing requirements  foreign government instability and changes  and us and foreign laws and policies affecting trade and investment 
although we did not experience any materially adverse effects from our foreign operations as a result of these factors in the last year  one or more of these factors has had an adverse effect on us in the past and they could adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  although we try to hedge our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  our competitive position relative to non us suppliers can be affected by the exchange rate of the non us dollar against other currencies  particularly the japanese yen and euro 
taxes 
from time to time  we have received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries in which we operate 
these governments or other government entities may serve future notices of assessments on us and the amounts of these assessments or our failure to favorably resolve such assessments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
current world events 
recent unrest in many parts of the world including the continuing hostilities in iraq and terrorist activities worldwide have resulted in additional uncertainty on the overall state of the world economy 
there is no assurance that the consequences from these events will not disrupt our operations either in the us or other regions of the world where we have operations 
although the sars illness appears to have been contained  if it or other pandemic illness emerges in asia  our business could be adversely affected 
the spread of such illnesses beyond asia could also negatively impact other aspects of our operations
