item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general cox radio  inc is a leading national radio broadcast company whose business is acquiring  developing and operating radio stations located throughout the united states 
cox enterprises indirectly owns approximately of the common stock of cox radio and has approximately of the voting power of cox radio 
the primary source of our revenues is the sale of local and national advertising to be broadcast on our radio stations 
historically  approximately and of our net revenues have been generated from local and national advertising  respectively 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  our stations also exchange advertising time for goods  services or programming  which can be used by the stations in their business operations 
we generally confine the use of such trade transactions to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
barter transactions for programming are used to supplement station program offerings 
advertising spots given up under programming arrangements are based on contractual terms 
in addition  it is our general 
table of contents policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
our most significant station operating expenses are employees salaries and benefits  commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are typically lowest in the first quarter 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
critical accounting estimates use of estimates our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the radio broadcasting industry 
an accounting estimate would be a critical accounting estimate for purposes of the disclosure in this report only if it meets two criteria 
first  the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made 
second  it must be the case that different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  contingencies and litigation  income taxes and fair value of financial instruments as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk below 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are the critical accounting estimates that require the most significant judgments and assumptions and are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and were required to assess our fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment within the first six months of and on at least an annual basis thereafter 
intangible assets include fcc licenses  goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   we had approximately billion in intangible assets  which represents approximately of our total assets 
the fair value of the fcc licenses is dependent on the cash flows of our stations 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we utilize independent appraisals to determine the fair market value 
these appraisals principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which incorporates variables such as market advertising revenues  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
the variables used in the analysis reflect historical station and advertising market growth trends  as well as anticipated performance and market conditions 
multiples of operating cash flow are also considered 
in the future  if these estimates change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets  which could have a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific party s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other parties  the evaluation considers the balance of aged receivables  the nature and volume of the portfolio  specific problem accounts and notes receivable  and economic conditions that may affect the debtor s ability to repay  and such other factors as  in our judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
accounts and notes receivable are charged off to the allowance when  in our opinion  such receivables are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
in addition  we consider the customer s creditworthiness prior to revenue recognition 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposures related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 

table of contents income tax estimates we evaluate our effective tax rates regularly and adjust rates when appropriate based on currently available information relative to statutory rates  apportionment factors and the applicable taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  among other factors 
certain of our deferred tax assets are comprised of loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax filing purposes for which recovery is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income we ultimately generate in the future  as well as other factors 
based on our estimate of future taxable income  there are no potential limitations to the utilization of these deferred tax assets  and therefore  no valuation allowance has been recorded 
tax liabilities are recorded  based on our assessment of the risk of loss in accordance with sfas no 
 to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we believe our estimate of our tax liabilities is a critical accounting estimate as it contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have currently accrued 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

year ended december  compared with year ended december  december  december  change change amounts in thousands net revenues local national other total net revenues net revenues are gross revenues less agency commissions 
local revenues are comprised of advertising sales made within a station s local market or region either directly with the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency

other revenues are comprised of internet revenues  barter revenues  syndicated radio program revenues  network revenues and revenues from community events and sponsorships 
net revenues for increased million to million  a increase compared to local revenues decreased and national revenues increased over overall growth in revenues was primarily a result of the focus on our core strategy  which includes managing our inventories  maintaining our competitive rates and the successful execution of our consultative selling strategy 
during  of our station clusters delivered revenue growth that either matched or outpaced their respective markets as reported in the miller kaplan market revenue reports 
clusters with solid revenue growth were orlando  tampa  richmond  dayton  louisville and greenville spartanburg

selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to promotional expenses increased during the first half of mainly due to increased promotional spending to maintain our competitive advantage and to promote the newly re formatted wfox fm in atlanta 
however  promotional spending was scaled back during the last half of due to lagging local revenues 
selling expenses increased largely as a result of increased compensation costs  including higher sales commissions directly related to increased revenues during the first half of  offset by a decrease in sales costs due to a change in the sales compensation structure in atlanta and southern connecticut and a decrease in incentive compensation during as compared to in addition  bad debt expenses decreased during december  december  change change amounts in thousands corporate general and administrative expenses depreciation amortization other the increase in corporate general and administrative expenses can be attributed to annual salary increases  increased insurance rates  increased professional fees related to the documentation of our internal control over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  costs associated with employee relocation  and higher pension expense due to lower than expected investment returns and a lower discount rate used to measure pension expense 
these increases were offset by reductions to incentive compensation accruals based on station operational performance and savings related to creating an in house research department during the prior year

the leaders with double digit revenue growth over were houston  up  richmond  up  tampa  up  long island  up  louisville  up  jacksonville  up  honolulu  up  and miami  up 
in atlanta  our largest market  revenues were down versus primarily as a result of a lackluster performance from wfox fm during excluding wfox fm  net revenues in atlanta would have been up during national revenue growth of outpaced local revenue growth of during  primarily because national revenues were negatively impacted more severely than local revenues during the prior year s economic downturn 
overall growth in revenues was primarily a result of improving macro economic factors affecting the advertising climate  coupled with successful execution of our consultative selling strategy 
december  december  change change amounts in thousands cost of services exclusive of depreciation shown separately below the increase in cost of services was primarily related to an increase in sports programming costs of approximately million in the atlanta market and an increase in music license fees of approximately million directly attributable to higher revenues 
these increases were offset by a decrease in cost of services at cox radio interactive cxri of million as a result of staff reductions

depreciation increased as a result of additions to property and equipment during totaling approximately million 
amortization decreased during because we adopted sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets  primarily our fcc licenses  no longer be amortized but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
amortization for represents expense for definite lived intangible assets only and is consistent with amortization expense for such assets in see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further discussion of our adoption of sfas no

however  cox radio does not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparties  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counterparties nonperformance 
the estimated fair value of the swap agreements  based on current market rates  approximated a net payable of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the swap agreements at december  is included in other current liabilities and other long term liabilities according to the respective maturity dates of the swaps 
the market risk for the interest rate swaps is mitigated as the variable rate received is hedged to the variable rate paid on the credit facility 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates would be fully offset by the interest rate variance applicable to the credit facility 
the determination of the estimated fair value of cox radio s fixed rate debt is subject to the effects of interest rate risk 
the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 
the estimated fair value of cox radio s fixed rate debt instruments at december  was million  compared to a carrying amount of million 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would be to increase the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt instruments from million to million at december   and from million to million at december  the estimated fair values of debt instruments are based on discounted cash flow analyses using cox radio s borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and dealer quotations 
the revolving credit facilities and cox enterprises borrowings bear interest based on current market rates and  thus  approximate fair value 
cox radio is exposed to interest rate volatility with respect to the foregoing variable rate debt instruments
