item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general mge energy is a holding company operating through subsidiaries in three business segments electric utility operations  gas utility operations  and nonutility energy operations 
our principal subsidiary is mge  which conducts our electric utility and gas utility operations 
mge generates and distributes electricity to nearly  customers in dane county  wisconsin  including the city of madison  and purchases and distributes natural gas to more than  customers in the wisconsin counties of columbia  crawford  dane  iowa  juneau  monroe  and vernon 
other subsidiaries  which constitute our nonutility energy operations  have been formed to own and construct new electric generating capacity 
those subsidiaries are currently undertaking the construction of a mw  electricity  steam  and chilled water cogeneration facility on the uw madison campus 
we became the holding company for mge on august   when mge shareholders exchanged their shares of mge common stock for shares of our common stock 
the share exchange had no accounting effect on mge s recorded assets  liabilities  revenues  or expenses 
mge s electric and gas utility operations represent a substantial part of our assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
our nonutility operations  relating  principally  to the development of a cogeneration project on the uw madison campus  are not significant at this time 
consequently  the following discussion focuses mainly on the results of operations and financial condition of mge 
executive summary in  our utility operations experienced an increase in gas deliveries offset by a slight decline in electric sales due to cooler than normal summer weather 
operation and maintenance expenses increased due to higher employee benefit costs associated with pensions and health care  higher transmission costs  and higher distribution and maintenance costs 
we also experienced lower interest costs as a result of debt refinancings that were completed in as well as the generally lower interest rates for our variable and short term debt during our liquidity and capital position remained strong during  although our overall debt increased as a result of a cogeneration facility that mge power west campus is constructing on the uw madison campus 
we anticipate relying on short and long term borrowings to support that construction and the associated capital expenditures 
we also anticipate a need for additional equity capital during beyond the amounts we are able to raise through our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
our primary focus today and for the foreseeable future is our core utility customers at mge 
mge continues to face the challenge of providing its customers with reliable power at competitive prices 
it plans to meet this challenge by building more efficient generation projects and continuing its efforts to control its operational costs 
we believe it is critical to continue maintaining a strong credit standing and financial strength in mge as well as the parent company in order to accomplish these goals 
results of operations earnings overview mge energy in  our earnings were million  or per share 
mge s increase in base rates to cover  in large part  rising fuel costs led to an increase in utility revenues 
electric retail sales declined slightly  but retail gas deliveries increased 
operations and maintenance costs increased due to higher costs for employee benefits health care  pension  etc  transmission wheeling charges  distribution costs  and maintenance 
these costs were somewhat offset by a decrease in depreciation costs  as mge was no longer required to contribute to the decommissioning fund for kewaunee in also  mge energy benefited from lower interest costs due to refinancing a large portion of its long term debt in and the lower interest rates on its variable rate and short term debt in in  our earnings were million  or per share 
mge s increase in electric retail sales  coupled with an increase in base rates to cover rising fuel costs  contributed to a increase in electric revenues 
purchased power costs increased substantially 
was the first full year mge purchased mw of capacity and energy to replace its share of generation lost from kewaunee 
mge sold its interest in kewaunee to wpsc in september as a result  mge s operations and maintenance costs were lower in mge s gas margin increased million due to growth in gas deliveries 
in  mge energy s earnings were million  or per share 
electric revenues remained constant despite a third quarter pretax adjustment of approximately million  reducing electric unbilled revenues 
electric operating income was down due to increased fuel costs  transmission wheeling expenses paid to atc  and higher distribution expenses 
gas operating income mainly decreased because warm weather in the fourth quarter resulted in lower gas deliveries 
other income increased substantially due to mge s equity in earnings of atc  gains on weather hedge instruments  and lower charitable contributions 
interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and less short term debt 
electric utility operations electric sales and revenues the following table compares mge s electric retail revenues and electric kwh sales by customer class during each of the years ended december in thousands revenues kwh sales residential       commercial       industrial       other retail municipal       total retail       sales for resale       other revenues   total       cooling degree days normal na na na electric operating revenues were up and in and due to the following in millions rate changes sales for resale volume other effects total rates 
the pscw authorized increases in mge s electric rates effective march   and january   to cover rising fuel costs  increased system demands  and the installation of an amr system 
revenues in also reflect a surcharge of on electric rates  effective october   and ending october   which the pscw authorized to recover deferred costs associated with forming atc and ongoing incremental transmission costs 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
sales for resale 
the change in reflects higher sales volume as the result of a contract to sell mw of electric capacity to alliant from january through august the change in was attributable to higher prices  although the volume of sales was lower due to lower off peak sales during the first half of that year 
volume 
electric retail sales were slightly lower in due to cooler than normal summer temperatures  as reflected in the reduction in cooling degree days 
the opposite effect was felt in when warmer than normal temperatures caused electric retail sales to increase 
total cooling degree days were up in other effects 
the other effects in reflect a fuel credit that was in effect from mid august through year end 
in  the increase was associated with a vendor settlement and a true up for a spring outage at kewaunee 
in  mge changed its method for incorporating unbilled consumption from prior periods into calculating amounts available for sale to customers 
the revised calculation determines unbilled quantities available for sale in the current month based on the current month and the trailing two months 
mge previously brought forward the unbilled quantity from prior months  which had the effect of accumulating any underestimated line loss amounts 
the three months is based on an assumption which mge believes is reasonable that all electricity consumed by all classes of customers is billed within three months 
mge also determined the ratio of unbilled to billed sales had a sufficient relationship to include that statistic in validating results of its estimation methodology 
this is in addition to the ratio between unbilled sales and accounts receivable that was previously used 
see footnote c for more information regarding the unbilled revenue estimation methodology 
electric fuel and purchased power in  fuel used for electric generation increased million  or  primarily due to a rise in the cost of natural gas used at certain mge generating plants 
mge s internal generation increased in purchased power expense increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in the cost of natural gas million 
the average price for purchased power was per mwh in compared to in  an increase of 
the increase in purchased power expense was partially offset by a decrease in volume million resulting from the expiration of a mw purchased power agreement with wpsc in september in  fuel used for electric generation decreased million  or  due to the following fuel costs for mge s electric generating units excluding columbia decreased million  or 
mge relied less on certain generating units because higher fuel costs made it generally cheaper to buy electricity than operate those units 
nuclear fuel expense decreased million  or  since mge sold its ownership interest in kewaunee in fuel costs for the columbia units increased million  or  due to higher coal costs 
in  purchased power expense increased million  or 
mge purchased electric capacity and energy to replace the energy generation lost from selling its ownership interest in kewaunee and to meet expected load growth 
in june  mge exercised an option to buy mw of electric capacity and energy at a fixed price from wpsc from september   through september  electric operating expenses electric operating expense increased million  or  in and decreased million  or  in the following changes contributed to the net change in electric operating expenses for the indicated year in millions increased transmission costs due to growing reliance on purchased power amortization of deferred costs related to atc s formation and incremental operating costs increased health and pension expenses due to rising health care costs and lower investment returns on plan assets increased outside service expenses associated with holding company formation and participation in power the future proposal decreased operating expenses as a result of sale of interest in kewaunee increased miscellaneous distribution expenses increased regulatory expenses due to filing a cpcn for authority to build wccf increased decreased miscellaneous steam power expenses increased miscellaneous electric operating expenses total electric operating expenses amount for reflects a decrease of million  or  as a result of mge s recovery through rates of some carrying costs for actions taken at columbia to reduce nox emissions  partially offset by increased expenses for columbia of million  or  as a result of increased administrative and general overheads million and employee pensions and benefits million 
maintenance expense in  electric maintenance expense increased million  or 
this is due to the following factors increase in maintenance of distribution assets million  including substation work  transformers  and overhead and underground lines 
maintenance and system upgrades help to improve the reliability of mge s electric distribution system 
increase in other maintenance sources  including electric generating assets and columbia million 
in  electric maintenance expense was down million  or 
this decrease is the net result of the following two factors maintenance expenses declined million since mge sold its ownership interest in kewaunee to wpsc 
maintenance expenses at columbia increased million as a result of a scheduled seven week outage during april and may depreciation electric depreciation expense decreased million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in reflects lower decommissioning expense million as a result of the sale of kewaunee  offset in part by million of increased depreciation associated with an increase in electric plant assets 
the decrease in reflects reduced decommissioning expense million  reduced depreciation due to the sale of kewaunee million  see footnote  and is partially offset by increased depreciation expense for the addition of electric assets million 
gas utility operations gas deliveries and revenues the following table compares mge s gas retail revenues and gas delivered by customer class during each of the years ended december in thousands revenues therms delivered residential       commercial industrial       total retail       gas transportation       other revenues    total       heating degree days normal  na na na gas revenues were up in and decreased in due to the following in millions gas costs rates gas deliveries gas transportation other effects total average rate per therm of residential customers gas costs rates 
the pscw authorized increases in mge s gas rates effective march   and january   to cover increased system demands 
gas costs increased significantly in from the average rate per therm in increased compared to the prior year 
the reverse was true for despite a increase in retail gas deliveries  revenues decreased due to the decrease in the cost of gas 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on gas base rates 
retail gas deliveries 
the increase in was due to colder than normal temperatures  as reflected in the increase in heating degree days 
the same effect was felt in when colder than normal temperatures caused gas deliveries to increase 
total heating degree days were up in the increase also reflects a full year of ownership of the prairie du chien area natural gas system that was purchased on december   from we energies for million 
mge gained approximately  residential and commercial customers in southwestern wisconsin as a result of the purchase 
gas transportation 
the decrease in deliveries in reflects fuel switching by customers with other fuel options  who switched due to the higher price of gas 
the reverse effect was observed in as alternative fuel customers used more gas during the first half of  causing a increase in deliveries 
other effects 
the other effects in reflect an increase of million in the gcim and other miscellaneous increases totaling million 
natural gas purchased in  natural gas purchased increased million  or  primarily due to higher wellhead prices  on average 
natural gas prices cost per therm increased more than in a pga clause allows mge to pass along to customers the cost of gas  subject to certain limited incentives 
the pga is authorized by the pscw 
in  natural gas purchased decreased million  or  primarily due to lower wellhead prices 
gas operating expenses gas operating expense increased million  or  in and increased million  or  in the following changes contributed to the net change in gas operating expense for the indicated year in millions increased health and pension expenses due to rising health care costs and lower investment returns on plan assets increased administrative and general costs decreased uncollected revenues increased miscellaneous gas operating expenses total gas operating expenses depreciation gas depreciation expense increased million and million in and  respectively  as a result of additional gas plant assets 
gas cost incentives under mge s gcim  if actual gas commodity costs are above or below a benchmark set by the pscw  then mge s gas sales service customers and shareholders share equally in any increased costs or savings up to million 
any costs or savings that exceed million will be passed on to gas sales service customers 
the pscw allows mge to resell gas pipeline capacity reserved to meet peak demands but not needed every day to serve customers 
revenues from capacity release that exceed or fall short of pscw targeted levels are shared equally 
in  mge shareholders benefited million after tax from capacity release revenues and commodity savings under the gcim 
the pscw recently lowered the formula used in establishing the benchmark for gas commodity costs 
beginning february   the benchmark will be of what it would have been under the prior formula 
this change is intended to better reflect market conditions 
other general taxes the increase million in other general taxes from to is due to an increase in mge s license fee tax  which for any year is based on adjusted operating revenues of the prior year 
the wisconsin license fee tax is in lieu of all property taxes on utility property 
income taxes the effective income tax rate increased slightly from from to due to constant amounts of tax credits amortized investment tax credits and credit for electricity from wind energy in relation to pretax income see footnote 
the increase in effective income tax rates from to to is partly attributable to lower amounts of amortized tax benefits from excess deferred income taxes and deferred investment tax credit 
these lower amortized tax benefits are the result of the mge s investment in atc and the sale of its interest in kewaunee  both transactions 
in compared to  amortized excess deferred income taxes and amortized investment tax credits decreased by a total of million 
additionally  the state tax component of the effective income tax rate was greater in than in due to permanent differences for certain one time intercompany transactions for state tax purposes and for costs of capital incurred in forming mge energy on august  other nonoperating items in  mge construct received a service fee from the state in relation to wccf of million 
this was offset by an increase in charitable contributions of million 
dividend and interest income increased in by million 
in  other income decreased million  or 
the decrease in other income is attributed to the following mge transferred its qualified decommissioning fund million  fair market value and nonqualified decommissioning fund million  fair market value to wpsc with the sale of its ownership interest in kewaunee footnote 
there was no impact on earnings 
the lower decommissioning earnings on trust assets were offset by an equal decrease in accumulated depreciation expense 
the related decrease in other income was million 
an increase in charitable contributions reduced other income by million 
in  mge received a million pretax gain from weather hedge instruments 
during  mge did not receive a similar benefit 
the net effect was a million decrease in other income in interest expense in  interest expense decreased by million  or  due to the following factors mge refinanced a large portion of its long term debt in  helping to decrease interest expense by million 
lower short term interest rates coupled with reduced borrowing levels helped to decrease other interest expense by million 
in  interest expense decreased million  or  due to the following factors lower rates on mge s million variable rate debt which matured on may  reduced interest expense by million 
lower short term debt levels in the first quarter  coupled with significantly lower interest rates  reduced other interest expense by million 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following summarizes cash flows for mge energy and mge during   and mge energy mge thousands of dollars cash provided by used for operating activities       investing activities       financing activities       cash provided by operating activities for mge energy in  cash provided by operating activities increased million  or 
working capital increased million primarily due to increases in unbilled revenues million  stored natural gas million  prepayments million  and accounts receivable million 
these increases in current assets were offset by higher accounts payable of million and other current liabilities totaling million 
deferred income taxes increased million in due to the impact of additional bonus depreciation  which went into effect in may an increase in other noncurrent items net  of million  also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
in  cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or 
working capital decreased million primarily due to an increase in customer payables 
depreciation and other amortization expenses decreased million  mainly because mge sold its ownership interest in kewaunee 
deferred income taxes for decreased million compared to the significantly larger deferred tax expense in was due to selling kewaunee  which resulted in reversal of temporary differences associated with the plant and decommissioning funds 
cash provided by operating activities for mge in  cash provided by operating activities increased million  or 
working capital increased million in due to a decrease in accounts receivable of million and increases in accounts payable of million 
other current assets  such as unbilled revenues  inventories  and prepayments  increased in total million 
other current liabilities increased million 
deferred income taxes increased million in  while depreciation decreased million  due to lower decommissioning expenses 
other noncurrent items  net  increased million  which contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
in  cash provided by operating activities decreased million 
working capital increased million in due to an increase in accounts receivable of million and increases in unbilled revenues and prepayments of million each 
the increases in current assets were offset by an increase in accounts payable of million  an increase in other current liabilities of million  and a decrease in inventories of million 
decreases in depreciation of million and deferred taxes of million attributed to the decrease in operating activities 
the decreases in these items was attributable to the sale of kewaunee as discussed earlier 
capital requirements and investing activities for mge energy and mge in  mge energy s cash used for investing activities increased million 
capital expenditures increased million in utility plant additions decreased million  while capital expenditures related to the wccf increased million over last year 
mge s advance to atc in connection with the installation of equipment and system upgrades for wccf increased million in in  mge was still contributing to the decommissioning fund for kewaunee 
in  cash used for investing activities increased million 
utility plant additions were up million due to installing an amr system  installing nox emissions equipment at columbia  and upgrading mge substations to improve reliability 
capital expenditures related to wccf totaled million 
the increase in also reflects an unfavorable comparison to  in which mge received a million capital distribution from atc and million for selling its interest in kewaunee 
the following table shows mge energy s and mge s estimated capital expenditures for  actual for  and the three year average for to in thousands for the years ended december estimated actual three year average to electric production    transmission distribution and general    nuclear fuel  total electric    gas    common    utility plant total    nonutility wccf    mge energy total    mge energy s and mge s liquidity are primarily affected by their construction requirements 
mge s major capital projects included substation improvements million  amr project costs million  upgrading its energy management system million 
mge energy used funds received as dividend payments from mge as well as short and long term external financing to meet its capital requirements and cash obligations  including dividend payments 
external financing included short term financing under existing lines of credit and longer term financing through the issuance of million of senior secured notes due september   and the issuance of  shares of its common stock pursuant to a distribution agreement with banc one capital markets  inc while dividends from mge will remain a significant source for the cash needs of mge energy  mge energy expects that revenues from the wccf will supplement those dividends starting in when the wccf becomes operational 
in the interim  mge energy expects to continue to use existing lines of credit and to issue additional long term debt and shares of common stock  in addition to cash dividends from mge  to meet its capital requirements and other cash obligations  including dividends 
dividend payments by mge to mge energy are subject to restrictions arising under a january   pscw rate order and  to a lesser degree  mge s first mortgage bonds 
the pscw order limits the amount of dividends that mge may pay mge energy when its common equity ratio  calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding  is less than 
under those circumstances  mge may not pay dividends in excess of million plus dividends on shares issued in excess of the shares issued in the rate proceeding forecast if the proceeds are invested in mge 
mge s common equity ratio at december   as determined under the calculation used in the rate proceeding  is estimated to be 
the rate proceeding calculation includes as indebtedness imputed amounts for mge s outstanding purchase power capacity payments and other pscw adjustments and excludes the indebtedness associated with mge power west campus  which is consolidated in accordance with fin no 
r into mge s financial statements 
in addition  mge has covenanted with the holders of its first mortgage bonds not to declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or purchase any shares of its common stock unless  after giving effect thereto  the aggregate amount of all such dividends and distributions and all amounts applied to such purchases  after december   shall not exceed the earned surplus retained earnings accumulated subsequent to december  as of december   approximately million was available for the payment of dividends under this covenant 
mge used internally generated funds  short term debt  and proceeds from common stock issued through mge energy s dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan to satisfy most of its capital requirements and expects to do the same in for the larger capital investments  mge would expect to finance these with additional long term debt and capital contributions from mge energy 
financing activities and capitalization matters for mge energy and mge in  cash provided by mge energy s financing activities was million 
on september   mge energy s subsidiary  mge power west campus  issued million in private placement debt  increasing long term debt and using the proceeds from this issue to pay off short term debt 
mge energy was temporarily financing the capital expenditures for wccf with short term debt 
mge refinanced million of its  series  first mortgage bonds with lower cost debt 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock increased million when compared to last year 
in addition to its dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  mge energy also has been selling additional shares of stock through banc one capital markets  inc  under a distribution agreement 
short term debt decreased million in mge energy  through its affiliate mge construct  received a reimbursement of million in november from the state for its share of the capital expenditures related to wccf 
this reimbursement was used to pay down mge energy s bank loan 
in  mge energy s cash provided by financing activities was million 
short term debt increased million 
two long term debt issues occurred in the fourth quarter of a million issue replaced the million in debt that matured in may  which was rolled into short term debt at that time 
another million issue financed capital expenditures for the amr project  which had been financed with short term debt 
in  mge s cash used for financing activities was million

additionally  at december   mge energy had million in bank loans outstanding 
d mge has guaranteed repayment of certain receivables it sold to a financial institution under a chattel paper agreement see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other factors due to the performance of the united states debt and equity markets  the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of pension and postretirement benefit plans has decreased 
these factors may also result in additional future funding requirements of the pension and postretirement benefit plans 
business and regulatory environment electric transmission atc on january   mge transferred substantially all of its electric transmission facilities to atc in exchange for approximately a interest in this joint venture 
atc is comprised of wisconsin investor owned utilities and some wisconsin municipal utilities  cooperatives  and power supply agencies 
the pscw authorized an electric rate surcharge of million  or  over a twelve month period ended october   for mge to recover deferred costs associated with atc s formation and ongoing incremental transmission costs during and on november   mge and atc entered into an interconnection agreement related to transmission system upgrades for wccf 
mge issued to atc a notice to proceed for the procurement of the equipment for the system upgrades 
mge has advanced funds for construction of transmission equipment and work done by atc related to wccf in the amounts of million and million in and  respectively 
mge expects to advance an additional million in mge will be reimbursed by atc upon completion of the project 
kewaunee sale mge sold to wpsc its ownership interest in kewaunee in september in exchange for a cash payment of million  mge transferred its net book value of utility plant million  net nuclear fuel million  inventories million  and other assets million 
these assets were offset by million owed to wpsc 
on the closing date  mge also transferred its qualified decommissioning fund million  fair market value and nonqualified decommissioning fund million  fair market value  which decreased accumulated depreciation by an equal amount 
under the kewaunee sale agreement  mge was obligated to continue collecting decommissioning costs from its customers during and to remit those amounts  net of trust investment expenses and taxes on investment income  to the wpsc nonqualified decommissioning fund  which it did on january  mge has no further obligation with respect to the decommissioning of kewaunee except as described in the next paragraph with respect to spent nuclear fuel 
the federal government is responsible for the disposition and storage of spent nuclear fuel 
federal legislation is being considered to establish an interim storage facility 
spent nuclear fuel is currently stored at kewaunee 
minor plant modifications to the spent fuel pools completed in should ensure kewaunee has sufficient fuel storage capacity until the end of its licensed life in mge retained its spent fuel obligations for all fuel burned at kewaunee for mge s share of the generation from the opening of the plant to the closing date 
wpsc took title to such fuel at the closing date 
a surcharge imposed by the national energy policy act of requires nuclear power companies to fund the decontamination and decommissioning of us department of energy facilities that process nuclear fuel 
as a result  the kewaunee co owners are required to pay a surcharge on uranium enrichment services purchased from the federal government prior to october  on an inflation adjusted basis  mge s portion of the obligation related to kewaunee is approximately million at december  mge is required to continue paying its portion of this annual assessment 
as allowed under the kewaunee sale agreement  mge exercised an option to purchase mw of electric capacity and energy at a fixed price from september   through september   to help meet customers electric needs 
industry restructuring in wisconsin wisconsin has focused on building the infrastructure needed within the state to provide reliable electric service to customers 
wisconsin has been building new generating capacity  improving existing and adding new electric transmission lines  and continues to develop an independent electric transmission system operator 
state regulators realize a competitive market cannot exist when supply is short 
the pscw will decide if or when it is appropriate for retail competition to proceed in the electric industry 
mge cannot predict what impact future pscw actions may have on its future financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
restructuring the electric industry could affect mge s ability to continue establishing certain regulatory asset and liability amounts allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
mge is unable to predict whether any adjustments to regulatory assets and liabilities will occur in the future 
however  the pscw has recognized the need to allow recovery for commitments made under prior regulation 
nonutility energy outlook power the future generation on february   mge secured an option to own a portion of the advanced technology  coal fired  base load generation proposed in we energies power the future plan 
the plan included three new mw coal fired plants  which would be located in wisconsin 
on november   a pscw order approved issuing a cpcn for we energies proposal for two of the coal facilities 
pursuant to an amended agreement reached on january   mge has the option to acquire an undivided under certain conditions ownership interest in each of the proposed coal plants or up to approximately mw per unit 
if the options on units and are fully exercised  mge energy s share of capital costs is estimated to be million 
unit is expected to begin operating in and unit is scheduled to begin operating in mge has filed its own certificate of authority with the pscw for the coal facilities and a proposed lease structure with an mge energy affiliate 
mge expects pscw approval on this filing in the first half of wccf the cost to construct wccf is expected to be approximately million in total  of which mge power west campus portion will be million 
on november   the state paid million to mge construct for its share of construction costs incurred since its last payment in november mge construct now bills the state monthly for its share of the cost of wccf in accordance with the epc agreement 
as of december   mge power west campus had incurred million of costs on the project  which is reflected in construction work in progress on mge energy s and mge s consolidated balance sheets 
these costs largely represent amounts paid under long lead time equipment contracts in order to meet project schedules 
in  mge construct received a service fee of million pretax from the state in relation to its role as epc contractor for wccf 
the total fee of million will be recognized as services are rendered and will be collected over a month period 
mge energy  mge power west campus  and mge construct have assumed certain risks related to some of the executed agreements 
in the epc agreement  mge power west campus is responsible for cost overruns and mge construct is responsible for the construction process of the entire facility  paying liquidated damages relating to failure to achieve the mechanical completion date guarantee and or the acceptance test capacity guarantee 
mge energy is the guarantor of mge construct s obligations under the epc agreement 
critical accounting policies mge energy and mge the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
because of the inherent uncertainty in the nature of the matters where estimates are used  actual amounts could differ from estimated amounts 
the following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and require the use of judgment in estimating matters that are inherently uncertain 
unbilled revenues revenues from the sale of electricity and gas to customers are generally recorded when electricity gas is delivered to those customers 
the quantity of those sales is measured by customers meters 
due to the large volume of those meters  it is impractical to read all of them at month end 
meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter reading schedules 
consequently  at the end of any month  there exists a quantity of electricity and gas that has been delivered to customers but has not been captured by the meter readings 
as a result  management must estimate revenue related to electricity and gas delivered to customers between their meter read dates and the end of the period 
these estimates include the amount of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers line loss and the amount of electricity actually delivered to customers 
the mix of sales between customer rate classes  which is based upon historical utilization assumptions 
during  many of mge s largest customers were shifted to a calendar month bill 
as a result of this shift  the majority of these customers electricity usage is now accounted for in the unbilled calculation 
the unbilled amounts are based on actual usage billed the following month and are therefore very reliable 
due to this billing shift  mge has seen the ratio of unbilled to billed electric sales climb 
the ratio has settled into a range of to  and mge will continue to monitor and track this range 
pension plans mge maintains qualified and nonqualified pension plans 
mge also provides health care and life insurance benefits for its retired employees 
mge s pensions are funded through an outside trust 
in addition to the market returns  various other assumptions also affect the investment returns and pension costs 
assumed return on assets 
this assumption is the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
for  mge used a assumed return on assets 
this rate was set at the end of one of the approaches mge used in determining its assumed return on assets is based on historical returns 
as of december   the ten year historical return was 
discount rate 
the discount rate for sfas no 
pension cost purposes is a rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled 
mge bases its rate on high grade bond yields with a basis point adder 
this adder is based on the relatively long duration of pension plan liabilities  benefit payments that are in the form of an annuity  and the rate used has historically been at the top of the range 
moody s aa corporate bond yield was on december  this approach generated a discount rate ie   rounded 
medical trend assumptions 
the health care cost trend rate is the assumed rate of increase in per capita health care charges 
for  the health trend was reset to with the ultimate trend of reached in tax provision mge energy s and mge s tax provisions  including both current and deferred components  are based on estimates  assumptions  calculations  and interpretation of tax statutes for the current and future years 
determination of current year federal and state income tax will not be settled for years 
management regularly makes assessments of tax return outcomes relative to financial statement tax provisions and adjusts the tax provisions in the period when facts become final 
accounting for derivative instruments mge accounts for derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 amendment of sfas no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 all derivatives except those qualifying for the normal purchase normal sale exception are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
fair value is determined using current quoted market prices 
if a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in its market value is generally deferred as a component of other comprehensive income until the transaction it is hedging is completed 
conversely  the change in the market value of a derivative not designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in current period earnings 
a cash flow hedge is a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
to qualify as a cash flow hedge  the fair value changes in the derivative must be expected to offset to of the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
in the third quarter of  mge received approval from the pscw to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the deferral of the effects of mark to market accounting as required by sfas no 
on contracts related to mge s regulated operations 
regulatory assets liabilities regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow future recovery of those costs through rates 
mge bases its assessment of recovery by precedents established by the regulatory body 
regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers to fund future expected costs or amounts received in rates that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods 
these costs typically include deferral of energy costs  the normalization of income taxes  and the deferral of losses incurred on debt retirements 
the accounting for these regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
mge continually assesses whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probability of future recovery 
this assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
if future recovery of costs becomes no longer probable  the assets and liabilities would be recognized as current period revenue or expense 
amortization of regulatory assets is provided over the recovery period as allowed in the related regulatory agreement 
it is also included in depreciation and amortization expense 
the most significant regulatory assets recorded by mge include decommissioning and decontaminating enrichment facilities  environmental costs  deferred charges related to the setup of atc  deferred charges on the interest expense of its a series first mortgage bonds  deferred charges related to the effects of mark to market accounting as required by sfas no 
 and deferred charges related to tax recovery on afudc equity 
see footnote for a listing of these assets and liabilities 
the most significant regulatory liabilities recorded by mge include decommissioning and decontaminating enrichment facilities  deferred credits related to the accounting of deferred taxes as required by sfas no 
 amounts recorded for certain gas supply contracts that are considered derivatives under sfas no 
but are part of the pga clause authorized by the pscw  and a customer fuel credit 
adoption of accounting principles and recently issued accounting pronouncements mge energy and mge sfas no 
in  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
provides accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
mge energy and mge were required to adopt sfas no 
as of january  retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of sfas no 
are those for which there is a legal obligation under existing or enacted law  statute  written or oral contract  or by legal construction under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
effective january   mge recorded an obligation for the fair value of its legal liability for asset retirement obligations associated with removing an electric substation  a combustion turbine generating unit  wind generating facilities  and the photovoltaic generating facilities  all of which are located on property not owned by mge and would be removed upon the ultimate end of the lease 
at december   this liability is estimated at million and is included in other deferred liabilities 
at the point the liability for asset retirement is incurred  sfas no 
requires capitalization of the costs to the related asset  property  plant  and equipment  net 
for asset retirement obligations existing at the time of adoption  the statement requires capitalization of costs at the level that existed at the point of incurring the liability 
these capitalized costs are depreciated over the same period as the related property 
at the date of adoption  the depreciation expense for past periods was recorded as a regulatory asset in accordance with sfas no 
because mge believes the pscw will allow it to recover these costs in future rates 
current depreciation of the asset retirement cost is also being deferred as a regulatory asset under sfas no 
the initial liability is accreted to its present value each period 
mge defers this accretion as a regulatory asset based on its determination that these costs can be collected from customers 
mge also may have asset retirement obligations relating to various assets  such as combustion turbine generating units  small distributed generating units  aboveground and underground storage tanks  facilities located at columbia co owned with alliant and wpsc  and certain electric and gas distribution facilities 
these facilities are generally located on property owned by third parties  on which mge is permitted to operate by lease  permit  easement  license  or service agreement  but also include some facilities located on property owned by mge 
the asset retirement obligations associated with these facilities cannot be reasonably determined due to the indeterminate life of the related assets 
the pro forma asset retirement obligation mge would have recognized as of january   had mge implemented sfas no 
as of that date  was approximately million based on the information  assumptions  and interest rates as of january   used to determine the million liability recognized upon initial adoption of sfas no 
because mge s regulators are allowing these costs to be recovered in future rates  adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of would have had no impact on net income and earnings per share of common stock 
accordingly  pro forma impacts are not presented 
the following table shows costs as of january   and changes to the asset retirement obligation and accumulated depreciation during the twelve months ended december  in thousands a original asset retirement obligation b accumulated accretion c a b asset retirement obligation d accumulated depreciation related asset balance  jan

  as of december   mge s regulatory asset  included in deferred charges  is the total accumulated accretion  and accumulated depreciation  or  mge made a significant reclassification related to the reporting of accumulated costs of removal that are non sfas no 
obligations 
the reclass removed the costs from accumulated depreciation and recorded them as regulatory liability 
sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
is effective for transactions initiated after december  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
mge energy has no stock options as of december   and therefore sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
on april   the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of sfas no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts for hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends certain other existing pronouncements 
the amendments will result in a more consistent reporting of contracts that are derivatives in their entirety or that contain embedded derivatives that warrant separate accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of sfas no 
as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for interim periods beginning after june   for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities which will be effective for interim periods beginning after december  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued an amended sfas no 
 employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits 
this revised statement requires additional disclosures to those in the original sfas no 
about the plan assets  obligations  cash flows  and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans 
fin no 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation provides the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in interim and annual financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation 
mge makes available to qualifying customers a financing program for the purchase and installation of energy related equipment that will provide more efficient use of utility service at the customer s property 
mge is party to a chattel paper purchase agreement with a financial institution under which it can sell or finance an undivided interest with recourse  in up to million of the financing program receivables  until february  loans totaling million have been sold to the financial institution during the liability for the fair value of the obligation associated with these loans is not material 
mge would be required to perform under the guarantee if the customer defaulted on its loan 
the energy related equipment installed at the customer sites is used to secure the customer loans 
the length of the mge guarantee to the financial institution varies from one to ten years depending on the term of the customer loan 
principal payments for the next five years on the loans are million in and and million in   and fin no 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
in december  the fasb issued the updated and final interpretation fin no 
r 
fin no 
r requires that an equity investor in a vie have significant equity at risk generally a minimum of  which is an increase from required under the previous guidance and hold a controlling interest  evidenced by voting rights  and absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses  receive a majority of the entity s expected returns  or both 
if the equity investor is unable to evidence these characteristics  the entity that retains these ownership characteristics will be required to consolidate the vie as the primary beneficiary 
fin no 
was applicable immediately to vies created or obtained after january  fin no 
r was effective on december   for interests in entities that were previously considered special purpose entities under then existing authoritative guidance 
mge power west campus is a vie pursuant to fin no 
r  as the equity investment at december   was not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional support 
mge concluded a vie relationship exists due to the long term lease arrangement between mge and mge power west campus 
mge power west campus will lease all of its assets  a power plant  to mge  pursuant to this leasing arrangement and mge will absorb a majority of the expected losses  residual returns  or both 
the vie was consolidated into mge as of december  eitf in july  fasb issued eitf  reporting realized gains and losses on derivative instruments that are subject to sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and not held for trading purposes 
this issue addresses whether realized gains and losses should be shown gross or net in the income statement  for contracts that are not held for trading purposes 
this issue will not have a material impact on the consolidated financials statements 
fsp in january  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
fsp permits employers that sponsor postretirement benefit plans plan sponsors that provide prescription drug benefits to retirees to make a one time election to defer accounting for any effects of the act 
the fsp requires all plan sponsors to provide certain disclosures  regardless of whether they choose to account or defer accounting 
fsp is effective for annual fiscal periods ending after december  if deferral is elected  the deferral must remain in effect until the earlier of the issuance of guidance by the fasb on how to account for the federal subsidy to be provided to plan sponsors under the act or the remeasurement of plan assets and obligations subsequent to january  mge has elected to defer recognition of the act 
sec sab no 
in december  the sec issued sab no 
regarding revenue recognition 
sab no 
revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins to make the guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
mge energy and mge will comply with the revised guidance 
inflation the current financial statements report operating results in terms of historical cost  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
because utilities can depreciate only the historical cost of utility plant  there may not be adequate cash flows from existing plant to replace this investment 
under pscw rate treatment  projected operating costs  including the impacts of inflation  are recovered in revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mge energy and mge 
market risks mge energy and mge are potentially exposed to market risk associated with interest rates  commodity prices  weather  and equity returns 
mge currently has no exposure to foreign currency risk 
mge manages some risk exposure through risk management policies and uses derivative instruments 
mge s market risk has not changed between and mge does not enter into speculative trading transactions 
interest rate risk mge issues commercial paper at varying interest rates for its short term borrowings see footnote 
mge also has million in variable rate long term debt outstanding as of december  borrowing levels under commercial paper arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors 
future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels 
mge has a swap agreement with a commercial bank at a notional amount of million  backed by mge s commercial paper 
mge pays a fixed rate of on the swap  which was used to replace a portion of mge s  series  first mortgage bonds 
mge manages its interest rate risk by limiting its variable rate exposure and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
mge is not exposed to changes in interest rates on a substantial portion of its long term debt until that debt matures and is refinanced at market rates 
mge records the changes in the fair market value of its commercial paper swap agreement currently in the income statement as required by sfas no 
each period  which is then offset by a corresponding regulatory asset or liability in accordance with authorization received from the pscw 
commodity price risk mge has commodity price risk exposure with respect to the price of natural gas  electricity  coal  and oil 
mge employs established policies and procedures to reduce the market risks associated with changing commodity prices  including the use of commodity and financial instruments see footnote 
mge s commodity risks are somewhat mitigated by the current ratemaking process in place for recovering electric fuel  purchased energy  and the cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
mge s electric fuel costs are subject to fuel rules established by the pscw  which further mitigate commodity risk 
under the fuel rules  if electric fuel costs exceed or fall below a bandwidth set by the pscw  mge can apply for a fuel surcharge or may have a fuel credit to its customers 
under the pga authorized by the pscw  mge passes through to customers the cost of gas  subject to certain limited incentives 
under the fuel rules  mge may include the costs and benefits of fuel price risk management tools implemented under a risk management plan approved by the pscw 
in  the pscw approved mge s electric procurement risk management program  with conditions  through december  no transactions have occurred under this program through december  mge has a limited number of financial gas commodity contracts 
these contracts are primarily comprised of exchange traded option contracts to manage the cost of gas and over the counter financial floating to fixed price swaps and calls for the winter set price firm gas sales service pilot program 
the derivative amounts recorded as a result of these gas contracts are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability because these transactions are part of the pga and not subject to incentive participation 
weather risk mge s sales forecasts  used to establish rates  are set by the pscw based upon estimated temperatures  which approximate year averages 
mge s electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season and  to some extent  to the winter heating season 
a significant portion of mge s gas system demand is driven by heating 
mge s gas margin revenues less gas purchased is collected under a combination of fixed and volumetric rates set by the pscw based on normal weather 
as a result of weather sensitive demand and volumetric rates  a portion of mge s gas margin is at risk for warmer than normal weather 
mge may use weather derivatives  pursuant to its risk management program  to reduce the impact of weather volatility on its gas margin 
in august  mge purchased a nonexchange traded heating degree day hdd put option with a strike of  hdd and sold a nonexchange traded hdd call option with a strike of  hdd 
the options have a net premium cost of million  notional amounts of  per hdd  a maximum hdd related receipt or payment of million  terms covering november   through march   and financial settlements against madison weather 
if the total actual hdd  as calculated under the contract  is greater than  mge will pay 
if the total actual hdd is less than  mge receives payment 
for the contract period  mge s average gas margin per hdd at risk is estimated to exceed  mge is accounting for the hdd options using the intrinsic value method pursuant to eitf  accounting for weather derivatives 
through december   actual hdd were  and contract allocated hdd strikes were  and  resulting in a million gain for mge 
a summary of actual weather information in the utility segment s service territory during   and  as measured by degree days  may be found in results of operations 
regulatory recovery risk mge s electric operations burn natural gas in several of its peak power plants or as a supplemental fuel at several coal fired plants and in many cases  the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas 
mge bears significant regulatory risk for the recovery of such fuel and purchased power costs when they are higher than the base rate established in its current rate structure 
as noted above in commodity price risk  the electric operations of mge operate under a fuel rules adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity 
this clause establishes a base rate for fuel and purchased power 
mge assumes the risks and benefits of variances that are within a bandwidth 
for and  fuel and purchased power costs included in mge s base fuel rates were million and million  respectively 
in and  the base fuel rates included a fuel credit in the amount of million and million  respectively 
equity price risk mge currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits through trust funds 
these funds  which include investments in debt and equity securities  are managed by various investment managers 
changes in market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
mge s risk of expense and annuity payments  as a result of changes in the market value of the trust funds  is mitigated in part through future rate actions by the pscw 
credit risk credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparty nonperformance 
mge is exposed to credit risk primarily through its merchant energy business 
mge uses credit policies to manage its credit risk  which includes utilizing an established credit approval process  monitoring counterparty limits  employing credit mitigation measures such as collateral or prepayment arrangements  and using netting agreements 
due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the electricity mge originally contracted for  mge could sustain a loss that could have a material impact on its financial results 
additionally  if a counterparty were to default and mge were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  mge s credit loss would include the loss in value of mark to market contracts  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
mge is obligated to provide service to all electric and gas customers within its respective franchised territories 
as a result  mge has a broad customer base 
for the year ended december   mge s ten largest electric customers represented approximately of its retail electric revenues 
mge s ten largest gas customers represented approximately of its gas revenues 
credit risk for electric and gas is managed by mge s credit and collection policies  which are consistent with state regulatory requirements
