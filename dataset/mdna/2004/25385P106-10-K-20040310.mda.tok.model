the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and related notes 
overview we manage our business through two reportable segments the internet banking division and the lending division 
on november  we completed our acquisition of magnet communications  inc magnet  a privately held company based in atlanta georgia  for million in cash and million shares of our common stock with a fair value of million 
with the acquisition of magnet  we also offer online cash management products to large financial institutions that are available as either a licensed software implementation or hosted in our data centers 
no customer accounts for more than of our revenues and we have no significant foreign operations 
summarized results of operations for our reportable segments were as follows for the three years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands dollars dollars dollars revenues internet banking lending unallocated and magnet total dollars margin dollars margin dollars margin gross profit internet banking lending unallocated and magnet total dollars dollars dollars operating expenses internet banking lending unallocated and magnet total dollars margin dollars margin dollars margin net income loss from operations internet banking lending unallocated and magnet total prior year results have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
unallocated amounts include charges that are not allocated to segment management to manage their businesses as noted below 
the operations of magnet were not integrated into an operating segment in the operating results of magnet from the acquisition date of november  were as follows revenue   gross profit   operating expenses  and loss from operations  unallocated operating expenses include  of intangible asset amortization 
gross profit includes of deferred stock based compensation included in cost of revenues 
unallocated operating expenses include of deferred stock based compensation   of intangible asset amortization  and  of restructuring  asset impairment and other charges 
gross profit includes of deferred stock based compensation included in cost of revenues 
unallocated operating expenses include  of deferred stock based compensation   of goodwill and intangible asset amortization  and  of restructuring charges 
a large portion of our internet banking revenue results from the number of active internet banking end users at our financial institution clients 
summarized end users  in thousands  at december of each of the last three years were as follows end users penetration end users penetration end users penetration potential end users at all sites  n a  n a  n a potential end users at live sites  n a  n a  n a active internet banking end users bill payment end users penetration for active end users is calculated as a percentage of potential end users at live sites 
penetration for bill payment end users is calculated as a percentage of active internet banking end users 
active internet banking end users are consumers who have accessed basic account information online within the period specified by our contract with the financial institution 
revenues we derive revenues primarily from long term service contracts with our financial institution customers  which pay recurring service fees based primarily on the number of active end users or end user transactions or fixed monthly amounts  primarily for hosting and maintaining web sites  as well as upfront implementation fees and other revenues 
revenue from recurring service fees are recognized as services are provided 
implementation fees are recognized ratably over the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service relationship  generally four years 
recurring service fees were of total revenues in  in and in other revenues are derived from web site design services  optional consulting and training services and other optional products or services purchased separately by customers that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process  and termination fees 
with the acquisition of magnet in  we also earn revenues from the sale of software licenses and maintenance fees to non hosted customers 
these other revenues are recognized upon the completion or delivery of the product or service if we have no remaining obligations  the amounts due are fixed and determinable  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
gross profit revenues are reduced by costs of revenues that are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  network costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment and software used in providing our service  expenses related to the operation of our data centers and fees paid to third parties  including bill payment vendors  online statement and check imaging vendors and communication services providers 
cost of revenues also includes the recognition of deferred implementation costs which are recognized ratably over the term of the customer relationship 
operating expenses we include sales  general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  amortization of intangibles resulting from acquisitions and restructuring  asset impairment and other charges in operating expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  sales  marketing  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  sales commissions  and other general corporate expenses 
in addition  these expenses include marketing expenses such as trade shows  promotional costs and end user marketing campaigns and the payments to core data processing vendors under marketing alliance agreements 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  related personnel expenses and consultant fees related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products and our data processing vendor interface software 
amortization of intangibles consists of the amortization of identifiable intangible assets created as a result of our acquisitions of ata  vifi and magnet 
we recorded restructuring charges of million in and million in as a result of these restructuring activities we closed one facility  reduced space utilized at three facilities  eliminated employee positions and relocated or reassigned employees 
in  we also recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to computer software and equipment abandoned or removed from service and other charges of million including million from the settlement of the fundsxpress litigation 
income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of  we determined that our deferred tax asset valuation allowance was no longer required 
this determination was based on an evaluation of positive and negative factors including our history of achieving operating objectives  the achievement of  and improvement  in sustained operating profitability beginning in the third quarter of  the long term nature of our contracts and our established customer relationships  future projections of pre tax income  and the lack of significant limitations on the use of acquired net operating losses 
we believe these factors will allow for the full realization of our net operating loss and research and development carryforwards as an offset to future taxable income 
we recognized an income tax benefit of million in including million related to reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance at december  partially offset by a net provision for current and deferred federal and state income taxes of million 
results of operations certain amounts for the years ended december  and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of from million for the prior year 
revenues for include million from the acquisition of magnet 
the internet banking division generated revenues of million representing of total revenues for the year ended december  compared to million and for the prior year 
this increase of million  or  was primarily due to an increased number of active end users driven by an increased penetration rate within our existing customer base 
during  active internet banking end users increased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  revenues for the lending division were million in compared to million for the prior year 
this increase of  or  is the result of a increase in applications processed from  in to  in  partially offset by a shift from higher priced historical call center applications to internet applications 
internet applications produce lower revenue per transaction  however  the costs associated with internet applications are lower than those associated with our call center applications which results in a higher gross margin percentage per transaction 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  from million in the prior year 
cost of revenues includes  of deferred stock based compensation expense in and  of magnet expenses in that have not been allocated to an operating segment 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  includes million related to the internet banking division compared to million for the prior year 
this increase of million  or  was primarily due to the cost to service additional end user transactions 
the percentage increase for internet banking cost of sales was smaller than the increase in the corresponding revenues due to our high concentration of fixed costs as discussed in the gross profit section below 
cost of revenues for the lending division for the years ended december  and remained constant at million reflecting the shift from higher cost call center applications to lower cost internet applications as the volume of transactions increased 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
gross margin for the internet banking division increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit margin for the internet banking division is primarily attributable to the leverage in our business model that leads to a higher gross profit margin as revenues increase above our relatively fixed cost base 
gross margin for the lending division increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the increase in gross margin for the lending division reflects the increase in revenues while costs remained flat due to the larger proportion of internet applications discussed above 
sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the prior year 
the increase is due primarily to an increase in payments to core data processing vendors under marketing alliance agreements  additional sales and client support costs  and increased spending for professional services  including amounts spent to recruit and retain our ceo  that were partially offset by decreases in the provision for doubtful accounts and amortization of stock based compensation 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the successful completion of the migration of the vifi customer base to our platform in and the geographic consolidation of certain business functions as part of our restructuring program 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of goodwill and intangible assets increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to one month s amortization of intangible assets created as a result of the acquisition of magnet 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  was  for the year ended december   a decrease of  or  compared to  for the prior year 
this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in amounts invested in cumulative effect of change in accounting method due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting method of million in to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to the ata acquisition to its estimated fair value 
income tax benefit  net as discussed above  we recorded an income tax benefit for of million comprised of million related to the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance partially offset by a net provision for current and deferred federal and state income taxes of million 
we expect to incur income tax expense at an effective tax rate of approximately in however  as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  we do not expect to make significant cash tax payments until at the earliest due to utilization of our net operating loss and research and development carryforwards to offset our current income tax liabilities 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  from million for the prior year 
revenues for the year ended december  included million related to the internet banking division compared to million for the prior year 
this increase of million  or  resulted from an increased number of financial institutions and end users combined with sales of additional services to our existing customer base 
during  active internet banking end users increased from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  the increase in active end users includes approximately  active end users that were added as a result of the vifi acquisition in the first quarter of revenues for the year ended december  included million relating to the lending division compared to million for the prior year 
this increase of  or  resulted from a increase in applications processed from  in to  in largely offset by the effect of a shift away from call center applications to internet applications 
internet applications produce lower revenue per transaction  however  the costs associated with internet applications are relatively lower than those associated with our call center applications which results in a higher gross margin percentage per transaction 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  from million for the prior year 
cost of revenues for the years ended december  and includes  and  respectively  of deferred stock based compensation which has not been allocated to the internet banking and lending divisions

this increase of million  or  was primarily due to the cost to implement and service additional financial institutions 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  included million related to the lending division compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease of  or  reflects the shift to the lower cost internet applications from call center applications discussed above 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
excluding the impact of deferred stock based compensation  gross margin for the internet banking division increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit margin for the internet banking division is primarily attributable to the leverage in our business model that leads to a higher gross profit margin as our revenues increase above our relatively fixed cost base 
gross margin for the lending division increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
the increase in gross margin for the lending division is due to the larger proportion of internet based applications discussed above 
sales  general and administrative sales  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  compared to million for the prior year 
as a percentage of revenue  sales  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
this decrease in the percentage of expense relative to revenue is primarily attributable to the leverage inherent in our business model which is described in the gross profit section above 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in deferred stock based compensation included in research and development expense as well as a decrease in the use of consultants and contract labor in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets amortization of goodwill and intangible assets decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the implementation of sfas no 
as of january   resulting in no goodwill amortization expense in compared to million in the prior year 
restructuring  asset impairment and other charges total restructuring  asset impairment and other charges were million in during the year ended december   we initiated a restructuring program to optimize our cost structure 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  for severance payments and million for a decrease in space utilized at three facilities 
additionally in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of long lived assets that were abandoned or removed from operations in and other charges of million primarily due to settlement of a lawsuit filed by a competitor at a cost of million  net of probable insurance recoveries 
in  we strategically restructured our business primarily to reduce operating expenses from redundant functions and facilities from the three acquisitions completed in as a result we recorded a million restructuring charge in interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was  for the year ended december   a decrease of million  compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income as result of lower rates of return on our cash and investment balances 
cumulative effect of change in accounting method as discussed above  due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a cumulative effective of change in accounting method of million resulting from the write down of the goodwill related to the ata acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred taxes  impairment of long lived assets  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under sab  we recognize revenues when fees are fixed and determinable  no obligations remain related to the earned fees  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
under eitf  we allocate revenues for deliverables that qualify as separate units of accounting to each unit of accounting based on either the relative fair value or the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair value is determined by the prices charged when each element is sold separately or other specific objective evidence of fair value 

recurring service fees are recognized as services are provided and these criteria have been meet 
we defer recognition of certain implementation fee revenue  which includes set up fees for each service element purchased by customers and mandatory training  that are not the culmination of a separate earnings process and recognize them ratably over the greater of the initial life of the customer contract or the estimated life of the customer service relationship  generally four years 
we also defer recognition of the related direct implementation costs and recognize them ratably over the same period 
other revenues are derived from web site design  optional consulting and training services and other optional products or services purchased separately by customers  which represent the culmination of a separate earnings process  and termination fees 
these revenues are recognized upon the completion or delivery of the product or service assuming the criteria for revenue recognition above have been met 
with the acquisition of magnet in november  the company also earns revenue from the sale of software licenses to non hosted customers 
revenue from the sale of software licenses is recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition 
for software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software  revenue is recognized upon delivery if the following criteria have been met there is evidence of an arrangement  collection of the fee is probable and the fee is fixed or determinable 
when professional services or other products are included with the sale of the license  revenue is allocated to each of the elements of the arrangement based on either the relative fair values or the fair value of undelivered elements based on prices charged when the elements are sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses associated with the potential inability of our customers to make required payments or for resolution of potential billing disputes 
we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when necessary 
the estimate of the amount of receivables we will not be able to collect requires judgment and is based on factors including our historical loss experience  current market conditions  the nature of any current billing disputes and the financial health of specific customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or our current loss profile was to change additional allowances may be required 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured at the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when those differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
prior to  we had determined it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets were not realizable 
accordingly  we fully reserved our deferred tax assets to reflect our history of operating losses and the inherent uncertainties surrounding future profitability 
in the fourth quarter of  based on our history of achieving operating objectives  the achievement of operating profitability beginning in the third quarter of  our projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  the long term nature of our contracts and our established customer relationships  and the lack of significant limitations on the use of acquired net operating losses  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
at december   we have deferred tax assets of million 
should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 
in addition deferred tax assets include million resulting from the acquired tax attributes of magnet based on a preliminary allocation of the purchase price 
this allocation may be adjusted upon completion of the final magnet income tax returns through the acquisition date 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our identifiable intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 both adopted on january   which generally require us to assess these assets for recoverability at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
we use the fair value method to assess our goodwill and have two reporting units  internet banking and lending 
we use the undiscounted cash flows method to assess qualifying identifiable intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of future impairment assessments could result in additional impairment charges that would further reduce the carrying values of these assets 
contingencies and litigation 
we evaluate contingent liabilities  including threatened or pending litigation  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and million of long term investments 
our investments are comprised of readily marketable commercial paper and us government agency bonds 
our intent is to hold these investments to maturity 
for financial statement presentation  we classify our investments as short term and long term based upon their maturity dates 
the market value of our investments is sensitive to changes in the level of us interest rates and the market ratings of the underlying companies 
therefore  if investments we hold are sold prior to their maturity date  a gain or loss may result 
we invest our cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality  investment grade corporate issuers 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in for federal tax purposes and for state tax purposes 
under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  certain substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carry forwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
we also had research credit carry forwards for federal and state tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
the research credit carry forwards will begin to expire in for federal income tax purposes and in for state income tax purposes 
although we will provide for income taxes at an effective tax rate of in we do not expect to make significant cash tax payments until at the earliest as we utilize these carry forwards to offset our current income tax liabilities 
in october  we renewed and amended our agreement with a bank for a million revolving credit commitment for a one year term 
the interest rate on this facility is equal to either the bank s prime rate  or libor plus 
we may draw down against this facility by electing either the bank s prime rate or libor for specified month  month  month  or month libor terms 
as of december   million was outstanding under our bank facility that was repaid on january  there were no amounts outstanding under our bank facility as of december  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash from operations was primarily the result of our operating income of million during the year ended december  as compared to our loss from operations of million including restructuring  asset impairment  and other charges of million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the improvement in as compared to of million was a result of reduced operating losses after adding back non cash charges and improved collections of accounts receivable 
cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash flows from investing activities in was due to an increase in cash used for acquisitions of million  due primarily to the cash portion of the purchase price paid for magnet of million  and a decrease in cash proceeds from maturing investments million 
we also issued million shares of our common stock in the acquisition of magnet with a fair value of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million due primarily to the purchase of short term investments of million and property and equipment of million 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock partially offset by higher repayments of debt 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
the decrease of million in was primarily the result of net payments on debt compared to borrowings in partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we had no material commitments other than our operating leases and minimum vendor commitments 
our commitments under these obligations are as follows payment schedule total thereafter in thousands operating leases minimum vendor commitments total obligations future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of research and product development efforts  any expansion of our marketing efforts  and any acquisitions 
we expect to continue to expend significant amounts on ongoing research and development  computer and related data center equipment  and personnel 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and our funds from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes the existing guidance related to the accounting for and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas no 
 a liability for a cost associated with an exit or a disposal activity will be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
the provisions of sfas no 
were effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we adopted this standard effective january  and the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on previously initiated restructuring activities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
were effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and disclosure requirements were effective for interim periods beginning after december  we intend to continue to account for stock based compensation to our employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
we have made certain disclosures required by sfas no 
in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and have made the additional interim disclosures required by sfas no 
in january  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this consensus addresses certain aspects of accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities  specifically  how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   or entities may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect adjustment 
the adoption of eitf in the september quarter had no material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
until this interpretation  a company generally included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity  as defined  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns 
fin no 
is effective for reporting periods ending after december  we do not have currently any investments in variable interest entities and accordingly the adoption of fin no 
in the december quarter had no impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in march  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
eitf addresses how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the provisions of eitf were effective for new arrangements entered into after december  the adoption of this guidance had no material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
changes the accounting guidance for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity by now requiring those instruments to be classified as liabilities or assets in some circumstances on the balance sheet 
further  sfas no 
requires disclosure regarding the terms of those instruments and settlement alternatives 
sfas no 
is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
in the september quarter had no material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the sec issued sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
revises or rescinds portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations 
it also rescinds the revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers document issued in conjunction with topic selected portions of that document have been incorporated into topic the adoption of sab no 
in the december quarter had no material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
an increase or decrease in market interest rates by as of december  would not cause a significant change in the fair value of our investments 
although the fair value of short term investments may change due to interest rate fluctuations  we have the ability to hold the investments to maturity  which reduces the overall risk 
we are also exposed to the impact of interest rate changes as they affect our revolving credit commitment 
the interest rate charged on our bank facility varies with the bank s prime rate or libor and  consequently  our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the facility 
as of december   we had no amounts outstanding under our bank facility 
we are not exposed to foreign currency risk since all revenues and expenses are in us dollars 
there were no significant changes to our market risk in
