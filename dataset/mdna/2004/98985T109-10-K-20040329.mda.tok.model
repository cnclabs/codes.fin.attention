item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing therapeutic protein based products for the treatment of human diseases 
the process for taking one of our discoveries to the marketplace is long  complex and very costly 
it is difficult to predict the time it will take to commercialize any given product candidate  but it would not be unusual to span ten years or more and cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
it is also a business of attrition  it is expected that less than of the proteins entering human clinical trials will actually make it to the marketplace 
for the products that do make it  particularly for those that address previously unmet medical needs  the markets can be significant  with a number of successful products selling in excess of billion per year 
an important element of our strategy is that we intend to maintain all or a significant share of the commercial rights to our products in north american markets 
as a result  we will be required to pay a significant portion of the development costs for our product candidates 
a second important element of our strategy is that we are developing a broad portfolio of product candidates to give our company more opportunities to be successful 
we currently have four product candidates in clinical development and expect to add additional proteins to this portfolio in the future 
thus  we are paying a significant portion of development costs for several potential products 
assuming these product candidates progress through clinical development successfully  the cost of clinical trials are expected to increase significantly 
our most significant financial challenges are to obtain adequate funding to cover the cost of product development  and to control spending and direct it toward product candidates that will create the most value for the company s shareholders over the long term 
it can be a complex and highly subjective process to establish the appropriate balance between cash conservation and value generation 
there are a number of important factors that we consider in addressing these challenges  including the following the nature  timing and magnitude of financing transactions  which would typically involve issuance of equity or equity based securities  the nature and timing of product development collaborations  which would typically provide for funding of a portion of the respective product development costs  as well as bring in near term potential revenues in the form of upfront fees and milestone payments  the breadth of product development programs  ie the number of potential disease indications for which a product candidate is tested in clinical trials  the number of products in our development portfolio and the decision to move new product candidates into clinical development  and periodic assessments of the relative capital requirements  risk and value of each of our product candidates 
we expect that it will be at least four to five years before we can generate enough product related revenues to reach cash flow breakeven 
in the interim  revenues from existing relationships will help to defray our expenses  but additional funding will be required  the amount of which could be significant 
we may decide to enter into additional product development collaborations  which would reduce our funding requirements 
we may also generate funding through licensing of patents that are not relevant to our product development programs 
it is likely that we will continue to look for opportunities to raise equity capital as a primary means of funding our company over the next several years 
the equity markets for biotechnology stocks have tended to experience long cycles during which the sale of equity securities has been extremely difficult 
it is not possible to predict the timing or length of these cycles 
as a result  most biotechnology companies  including ours  have adopted an opportunistic strategy of raising equity capital when it is available 
we believe this strategy is important to minimizing the financial risks to our company and our shareholders 

table of contents our financial statements for the year ended december  have been restated to reflect a change in accounting for a sale leaseback transaction 
subsequent to the issuance of these financial statements  we determined in consultation with our outside auditors  that the sale leaseback transaction that occurred in october was improperly accounted for 
we initially accounted for the transaction as a sale of the properties involved and as operating leases under the provisions of sfas subsequently it was determined that the leases contain a technical provision that could  under certain remote circumstances  result in our continuing ownership involvement with respect to the properties 
due to the existence of this provision  the transaction is more properly accounted for as a financing rather than a sale and leaseback of the properties 
see the note entitled restatement of financial statements in the notes to our financial statements for further information 
the following discussion and analysis gives effect to the restatement 
results of operations revenues royalties 
we earn royalties on sales of certain products subject to license agreements with novo nordisk and several other companies 
royalty revenues declined by from to reflecting a general flat to declining trend in the sales of products subject to the licenses 
in  despite the continuing lack of underlying sales growth  royalties increased by due to the weakening of the us dollar versus foreign currencies prominent in certain royalty calculations 
we do not expect any change in the underlying sales trend in the future and  beginning in  we expect substantial reductions in insulin royalties due to patent expirations in a number of major countries 
in  insulin royalties represented of our total royalty revenues 
we have opportunities to earn royalties in the future under other existing license agreements  but we cannot be certain when  or if  products will be sold subject to those licenses 
option fee from related party 
in all three years presented  we earned an annual option fee of million from novo nordisk under an option and license agreement  pursuant to which we have given them an option to license certain rights to proteins that we discover 
the initial term of this agreement expires in november  but novo nordisk has the option of extending it and paying million for two additional years 
if they do not extend the agreement  option fee revenue will decline to approximately million in  all of which was included in deferred revenue at december   and none will be earned in future years 
ig fusion protein license fee 
in  as part of a lawsuit settlement  we earned a million license fee related to the granting of a license to our ig fusion protein patents 
this was a one time payment for a fully paid up license and  therefore  we will not earn any future revenues with respect to this agreement 
license fees  milestones and other 
revenues from license fees and other up front payments are recognized over the period we are contractually required to provide other rights or services that represent continuing obligations 
at december   million of such revenues was included in deferred revenue  of which million is expected to be recognized in and the remainder in future periods 
for certain license agreements that require no continuing performance of us  we record license fees as revenue upon execution of the agreement 
we recognize revenues from milestone payments that represent completion of separate and substantive earnings processes when the milestone is achieved and amounts are due and payable 
from year to year  this revenue item can fluctuate substantially based on the completion of new licensing or collaborative agreements and the achievement of development related milestones 
although this revenue item increased both in and due to an increasing number of transactions and milestone payments  we cannot be certain this trend will continue in and beyond due to the uncertain nature of the events generating the revenue 
operating expenses research and development expense 
research and development expense has been our most significant expense to date  consisting primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  costs of consumables  facility costs and contracted services 
research and development expense increased in each of the past two years  by in and by in our expense in reflects an offset of million from costs reimbursed by novo 
table of contents nordisk under an il preclinical collaboration agreement  which is expected to end in early without the impact of this reimbursement  research and development expense would have increased by in increases over the periods reported largely resulted from significantly increased activities for the development of our four product candidates  rhthrombin  rfactor xiii  taci ig and il over the past three years  we have added approximately employees who are focused on product development  and external costs for contract manufacturing  clinical trials and preclinical testing have increased substantially 
these trends are shown in the following table in thousands 
restated salaries and benefits consumables facility costs contracted services depreciation and amortization subtotal il cost reimbursement from novo nordisk net research and development expense we anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to advance  and potentially expand  our internal product development programs 
in we expect that a number of factors  including the following  will contribute to a significant increase in research and development expense 
costs related to scale up and production of phase and commercial product for the rhthrombin and rfactor xiii programs  costs of significantly expanded clinical trial activity  particularly with respect to rhthrombin and taci ig  increased staffing to support expanded product development efforts  particularly in the clinical  medical  regulatory and quality areas  and reduced cost reimbursements from novo nordisk with respect to development of il based on these factors  we estimate that research and development expense in will fall within the range of million to million  depending on the actual timing of these factors 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and benefit expenses  professional fees and other corporate costs 
in  this expense increased substantially due to added administrative personnel  substantial legal costs associated with a patent infringement lawsuit settled in late  write off of design and engineering costs related to a terminated construction project  and increased expenses related to our operation as a public company 
in  general and administrative expense declined substantially  resulting from normalization of legal costs  lack of a construction cost write off  and cost control initiatives taken by the company in late and early we anticipate that general and administrative expense will increase in and subsequent years reflecting the additional administrative requirements of supporting our product development programs as they advance toward commercialization 
in addition  we will incur additional professional fees in order to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents noncash stock based compensation expense 
in and early  prior to the completion of our initial public offering  stock options were granted to employees and directors at exercise prices below the estimated fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
as a result  we recorded total deferred stock based compensation of million 
deferred stock based compensation is being amortized to expense over the vesting periods of the underlying options  generally four years  using the straight line method 
the expense recorded for represented a partial year of amortization 
the expense declined from to due to cancellation of unvested options held by employees who terminated their employment with the company 
we expect to amortize million in and million in  although actual amounts may be lower if unvested options for which deferred stock based compensation has been recorded are subsequently cancelled 
although we have no intention of doing so  the amount could increase if future options are granted with exercise prices below the estimated fair value of the common stock on the date of the grant 
other income expense other income expense consists primarily of investment income and interest expense 
investment income is generated primarily from investment of our cash reserves in investment grade  fixed income securities 
there are three primary factors affecting the amount of investment income that we report amount of cash reserves invested  the effective interest rate  and the amount of gains or losses recognized 
the following table shows how each of these factors affected investment income for the three years reported in thousands 
weighted average amount of cash reserves effective interest rate investment income before gains and losses net gains on sales of investments investment income  as reported we have accounted for the sale leaseback transaction completed in october as a financing transaction 
under this method of accounting  the net proceeds of the sale are considered to be a long term interest bearing liability 
rent payments under the leases are considered to be payments toward the liability and are allocated to principal and interest 
we recorded interest of million for a partial year in and million for the full year liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which we intend to use to fund our operations and capital expenditures over the next several years 
these cash reserves are held in a variety of investment grade  fixed income securities  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
we recently estimated that we expect to use approximately million to million of our cash reserves to fund our operations and capital expenditures in we believe that our existing cash resources should provide sufficient funding for approximately three years 
if we complete additional collaborative development transactions  which would generate both revenues and cost reductions  we believe that these cash resources may fund our company for up to four years 
cash flows from operating activities 
the amount of cash used to fund our operating activities generally tracks our net losses  with the following exceptions noncash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  gain or loss on sale or disposal of assets  and noncash stock based compensation  which do not result in uses of cash  net realized gains and amortization of premium on short term investments  which are reflected as sources of cash from investing activities upon maturity or sale of the respective investments  
table of contents changes in receivables  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain revenues and the subsequent receipt of cash payments  changes in deferred revenue  which reflect the difference in timing between the receipt of cash from option fees  license fees and other upfront payments and the subsequent recognition of these amounts as revenue over the period we are contractually required to provide other rights or services that represent continuing obligations  and changes in other assets and liabilities  which generally represent temporary timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses and their payment 
generally  with the exception of changes in deferred revenue  we do not expect these items to generate material year to year fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of net cash used in operating activities 
substantial license or upfront fees may be received upon the date we enter into new licensing or collaborative agreements and be recorded as deferred revenue 
for example  in upon the execution of a collaborative agreement for taci ig  we received an upfront fee of million  which was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue over the collaboration period 
the timing of these types of transactions are irregular and  thus  have the potential to create fluctuations in the relationship between our net loss and the amount of cash used in operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
our most significant use of cash in investing activities is for capital expenditures 
our business requires us to expend a certain amount each year to adopt newly developed technologies and replace obsolete assets 
in addition  we have used cash to purchase land and expand our facilities 
the following table shows the amount of cash going toward each of these types of capital expenditures in thousands ongoing equipment facility expenditures purchases of land for future expansion expansion of r d facility  including pilot scale manufacturing plant total the r d facility expansion is an ongoing project  for which we have approved a total budget of approximately million including all related equipment costs 
the project will be partially funded by an allowance from our landlord expected to total approximately million  which is reflected as cash flow from financing activities 
the project began in april and is scheduled to be completed in mid cash flows from investing activities also reflect large amounts of cash used to purchase short term investments and received from the sale and maturity of short term investments 
these amounts primarily relate to shifts between cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
because we manage our cash usage with respect to our total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  we do not consider these cash flows to be relevant to an understanding of our liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows from financing activities 
net proceeds from common stock offerings constitute by far the largest element of financing cash flows 
we received million in net proceeds from our initial public offering in and million from an underwritten follow on offering completed in october in  we received million of net proceeds from the completion of a sale and leaseback of our headquarter buildings  which has been accounted for as a financing transaction 
our landlord has agreed to provide an allowance of approximately million to be applied toward the cost of the r d facility expansion project described above 
we received million of this amount in and expect to receive the remainder in additionally  our landlord has committed to loan the company million to cover costs of the project not otherwise funded by the allowance 

table of contents we expect to incur substantial additional costs as we continue to advance and expand our product development programs 
we expect these expenditures to increase over the next several years  particularly if the outcomes of clinical trials are successful 
our plans include the internal development of selected product candidates and the co development of product candidates with collaborators where we would assume a percentage of the overall product development costs 
if  at any time  our prospects for financing these programs decline  we may decide to reduce our ongoing investment in our development programs 
we could reduce our investment by discontinuing our funding under existing co development arrangements  establishing new co development arrangements for other product candidates to provide additional funding sources or out licensing product candidates that we might otherwise develop internally 
additionally  we could consider delaying or discontinuing development of product candidates to reduce the level of our related expenditures 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on several factors  many of which may not be in our control  including results of research and development programs  cash flows under existing and potential future arrangements with licensees  collaborators and other parties  costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  and costs associated with the expansion of our facilities 
over the next several years we will need to seek additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings  and through other arrangements  including collaborative arrangements 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated opportunities that require financial commitments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
however  financing may be unavailable when we need it or may not be available on acceptable terms 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity based securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders would be reduced  and these securities could have rights superior to those of our common stock 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate expenditures for some of our development programs or expansion plans  or grant rights to third parties to develop and market product candidates that we would prefer to develop and market internally  with license terms that are not favorable to us 
contractual obligations at december  we are contractually obligated to make payments as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years building lease obligation operating leases construction contract manufacturing contract total the building lease obligation  which resulted from the sale and leaseback financing transaction  includes lease payments that will commence upon completion of the ongoing expansion project and that will result from a reset of the lease terms to years 
operating lease terms range from one to fifteen years with certain renewal provisions at our option 
the construction contract relates to our ongoing facility expansion project  and the amount shown above represents the remaining balance on the contract as of december  the manufacturing contract is for phase and commercial production of rhthrombin 
the amount shown above represents the base amount of the contract  assuming work proceeds as planned at the time the contract was signed 
there are several points in the project at which we have the option to terminate further work  thereby reducing the amount of our commitment 

table of contents critical accounting estimates royalty revenue 
we earn royalties on two proteins marketed and sold by novo nordisk  insulin and glucagon 
royalties are received from novo nordisk annually within days after the end of the calendar year 
for insulin  the royalties are based on manufacturing costs for the quantity of insulin sold during the year 
these costs are calculated in danish kroner  and then converted to us dollars based on the exchange rate at the end of the year 
royalties earned on sales of glucagon are calculated as a percentage of net sales 
we accrue estimated royalties at the end of each quarter based on historical sales data  estimates provided to us by novo nordisk and changes in the danish kroner to us dollar exchange rate 
adjustments are made in the following year reflecting the difference between our estimates and actual reported royalties and  to date  have not been significant 
we also earn royalties on several products marketed by other companies 
royalties on these products are received within to days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we accrue estimated royalties at the end of each quarter based on historical sales data 
adjustments are made in the following quarter reflecting the difference between our estimates and actual reported royalties 
license and upfront fees 
we enter into various licensing and collaborative agreements that generate significant license or other upfront fees with subsequent milestone payments earned upon completion of development milestones 
we use our best judgment to estimate the period over which we have continuing commitments to perform under these agreements 
revenue from upfront fees is recognized on a straight line basis over this period  which has ranged in duration from six months to ten years 
for certain license agreements that require no continuing performance on our part  license fee revenue is recognized immediately upon execution of the agreement 
stock based compensation 
as permitted by the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we have elected to follow accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for employee stock option grants and apply the disclosure only provisions of sfas to account for our stock option plans 
under apb  compensation expense is based on the excess  if any  of the estimated fair value of our stock at the date of grant over the exercise price of the option 
prior to the completion of our initial public offering  we granted options with exercise prices that were lower than the estimated fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
we used our best judgment to estimate the fair value of our stock as of the various grant dates  which resulted in share prices ranging from to 
based on these estimated values  we recorded million of deferred compensation  which is being amortized over the vesting period of the individual options using the straight line method 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is primarily limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including united states government and agency securities  high grade united states corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
however  a change of in the average annual interest rate could result in a change in interest income of million 
certain of our royalty revenue agreements are denominated in foreign currency  estimated during the year and settled at year end 
we have no other material foreign currency exposure  nor do we hold derivative financial instruments
