item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations following a three year decline in the wireless infrastructure industry  the company saw a resumption of growth beginning in the second half of and continuing throughout with the acquisition of celiant in june and allen telecom in july  the company positioned itself as the leading end to end wireless equipment subsystems provider for the radio frequency rf footprint 
the impact of these acquisitions and positive industry trends  such as network expansion and upgrades and continued emerging market growth  resulted in significant sales growth in sales in were a record billion  up or million compared to the majority of the sales increase was driven by the full year impact of the allen telecom acquisition million or and growth in the wireless infrastructure market million or  as wireless operators increased their investments in network upgrades and expansion 
while the company believes it is able to quantify the impact of these two key growth drivers on a consolidated basis  the rapid integration of allen telecom s products and operations into those of the company has made it impractical to do so at the product group level 
in addition  the introduction of new products within the satellite broadband market and growth within this market increased satellite communications sales by million to million in net income available to common shareholders for was million  or per share  compared with net income of million  or per share  in in  the company initiated plans to restructure and discontinue several non strategic businesses  which resulted in a million after tax charge in as a result of these charges the company recognized a net loss of million  or per share 
the company has completed all major activities under these plans and believes that these initiatives  combined with the allen telecom merger integration plan  will provide substantial on going cost savings and benefits in the future 
outlook the company believes there are signs of increased confidence in the market 
increasing minutes of use mou  global subscribers and data intensive applications are driving higher capacity utilization of existing networks  requiring wireless operators around the globe to place a greater emphasis on capital expenditures devoted to the rf footprint

cable products accounted for of sales in  in and in with an industry leading market share and a more mature market for coaxial cable  the growth rate for cable products is less robust than other components of the rf footprint 
in  the company made two asset acquisitions that expanded its product offering in the cable products group 
the company acquired selected assets of mts wireless components llc  a supplier of cable accessories  and yantai fine cable company to expand the company s addressable market into broadband cable tv 
network solutions sales were million  up from the prior year  due primarily to the full year impact of sales relating to the acquisition of allen telecom 
network solutions accounted for of sales in and in the primary product for network solutions is geolocation infrastructure 
the company anticipates that sales for geolocation products will decline in as wireless operators meet fcc mandated requirements for e caller location capabilities 
wireless innovations sales were million in  up from the prior year due primarily to the full year impact of sales relating to the acquisition of allen telecom

gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  in and in included in cost of goods sold for was million of restructuring costs related to inventory write downs 
gross margins decreased from to due to weak spending in the wireless infrastructure market and a change in product mix that resulted from the acquisition of celiant 
in  an evolving product mix  startup costs for new products and new manufacturing facilities  and an increase in international sales of cable products resulted in a lower gross profit margin 
the company s gross profit margin continues to fluctuate as the company evolves from primarily a passive components subsystem supplier into a full systems integrated product supplier 
the company anticipates that gross profit margins will improve by at least basis points in  assuming a stable product mix 
gross profit margins can vary across the company s major product groups 
generally  network solutions and wireless innovations are above the corporate average  and both of these product groups saw positive margin growth as sales increased in cable products margins also exceed the corporate average  but have generally declined over the last three years due to competitive market conditions and higher raw material costs 
the company uses copper  steel and petro chemicals in the manufacture of its cable products  and the costs of these commodities have increased significantly in the company expects to partially offset the impact of higher raw material prices in with a recently announced increase in cable pricing 
in addition  a higher proportion of cable sales in were to international markets 
this negatively impacted gross margin as north american wireless operators generally use larger diameter  higher margin cable in their networks  while many international markets use a narrower diameter  lower margin cable 
the company s base station subsystems product group is comprised of active components such as filters and power amplifiers that carry a slightly lower gross margin than the overall corporate average 
the company anticipates improving base station subsystems margins as more of the manufacturing and sourcing of these products is moved to lower cost manufacturing facilities 
the company s lowest margin product group is antennas 
antenna products gross margins were negatively impacted in by start up costs associated with the company s new satellite broadband products and two new facilities in mexico and the czech republic 
the company anticipates realizing improved gross margins in  having completed the relocation of manufacturing operations to these facilities 
operating expense as a percentage of sales decreased to of sales in  down from in each of and higher sales volume  synergies resulting from the allen telecom acquisition and cost savings from the company s restructuring efforts drove expenses down as a percentage of sales

other expense income net was expense of million in  income of million in and expense of million in the largest item in other expense income net is foreign exchange gains and losses 
in  the weakening of the us dollar against major currencies  primarily the euro  generated foreign exchange losses which resulted from net us dollar denominated assets at certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries where the euro is the functional currency 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations was in  in and in the effective tax rate for was lower than the statutory rate due to the favorable impact of foreign earnings taxed at lower statutory rates and the resolution of certain tax matters 
the lower effective tax rates in and also reflect benefits related to the utilization of capital loss carryforwards and significantly higher benefits related to export sales 
the company expects the effective tax rate for to be approximately 
this rate could be materially affected by the impact of earnings mix in foreign countries where the statutory rates are higher or lower than the federal statutory rate  by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws 
the company is subject to examination of our tax filings by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
the company regularly reviews and assesses the potential outcome of these examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax provisions 
the company is currently reviewing various provisions of the american jobs creation act of to determine the potential impact on its provision for income taxes

dividend policy 
although the company has never paid dividends to common shareholders  the board of directors periodically reviews this practice and  to date  has elected to retain earnings in the business to finance future investments and operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the first footnote to the company s consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies describes the major accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  sales returns  inventory reserves  revenue recognition  warranty costs  depreciation and amortization  goodwill and intangible impairments  contingencies  taxes  pension liabilities  and restructuring and merger integration costs 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
a material change in these or other estimates could potentially have a material impact on results of operations 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates 
table of contents revenue recognition during  the company recognized million or of its total revenue based on contractual terms of long term contracts 
revenue on these contracts is recognized pursuant to emerging issues task force issue  accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements 
each of the elements represents a separate earnings process and revenue is allocated among them based on the fair value of each element 
the fair value of these elements is estimated by management based on negotiated contracts and stand alone pricing of these components 
a material change in the estimated fair value of these components could have an adverse impact on results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  the company made a change in estimate for revenue recognition based upon changes in contractual terms with one significant customer 
the cumulative effect of this change in estimate was the recognition of an additional million in revenue from geolocation services that were performed earlier in the year see note summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the company s assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable 
although management believes that the current allowance is sufficient to cover existing exposures  there can be no assurance against the deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or against defaults that are higher than what has been experienced historically 
if our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us are overstated  it could have an adverse impact on results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence reserves are maintained based on management s estimates  historical experience and forecasted demand for the company s products 
a material change in these estimates could adversely impact gross profit 
warranty costs the company accrues for warranty costs based on historical trends in product return rates 
if the company were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with the company s historical experience  gross profit could be adversely affected 
goodwill the company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill on the first day of the company s fiscal fourth quarter 
the company has historically operated its business as a single reporting unit and uses the comparison of the company s total market capitalization to net book value as an indicator of impairment 
as the company s market capitalization exceeded the book value of the company s net assets by approximately billion on july   no further impairment tests were deemed necessary 
if the market capitalization would have been less than net assets or other indicators of impairment were present  the company would determine the fair value of net assets based on a discounted cash flow model 
the company did not find any indicator of impairment in and therefore no impairment was recorded 
due to uncertain market conditions  it is possible that future tests may indicate impairment in the fair value of goodwill  which could result in non cash charges  adversely affecting the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company s balance sheet reflects significant deferred tax assets  primarily related to net operating losses and tax credits carried forward 
to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that the company will not be able to utilize certain deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the company is required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of the deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the portion of deferred tax assets representing tax credits carried forward and certain foreign losses carried forward 
no valuation allowances have been established for the remainder of the deferred tax asset balances  as management expects the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the realization of higher taxable profits in the us and the utilization of tax planning strategies will make the realization of such deferred tax assets more likely than not 
the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant management judgments and is based upon the company s best estimates of anticipated taxable profits in the various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
the company currently anticipates that it will be required to earn taxable profits of approximately million in the us and approximately million in various foreign jurisdictions in order to fully utilize all deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets are related to certain us tax attributes which will begin to expire between and  and certain foreign tax attributes which will begin to expire in see note income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial 
table of contents statements 
changes in expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to the company s provision for income taxes 
restructuring at september   the company had a restructuring reserve of million for the integration of allen telecom operations and for the completion of its restructuring plan 
these accruals are based on the company s best estimates of the costs associated with merger integration and restructuring plans  including employee termination costs  lease cancellation  and other costs 
if actual costs of these activities differ significantly from these forecasts  results of operations could be impacted 
defined benefit plans some of the company s employees are covered by defined benefit plans 
approximately current and former employees of the company s united kingdom subsidiary  andrew ltd  participate in a defined benefit plan 
the company also acquired defined benefit plans from allen telecom  which cover approximately  current and former employees 
the allen telecom plans have been frozen and the company plans to fund these plans over the next two to four years 
the costs and obligations recorded for these plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
if actual results are significantly different than those forecasted or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
the discount rate enables management to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the company estimates that a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased benefit expense in by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased benefit expense in by million 
to determine the expected return on plan assets  management considers the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical returns on plan assets 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on pension plan assets would have increased or decreased pension expense in by million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s material off balance sheet arrangements are contractual obligations for the purchase of materials and services that are described below under aggregate contractual obligations and commitments as purchase obligations 
excluding these contractual obligations  the company had no material off balance sheet arrangements at september  
table of contents aggregate contractual obligations and commitments as of september   expected future cash payments under contractual obligations and commitments and the estimated timeframe in which such obligations are expected to be fulfilled were as follows payments due by period less than more than dollars in millions total year years years years long term debt a operating leases b purchase obligations c benefit plan obligations d total a long term debt includes maturities and interest obligations 
refer to note  financing  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the use and availability of debt and revolving credit agreements 
b see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of leases 
c purchase obligations of million represent purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory  as well as other goods and services  in the ordinary course of business  and exclude balances for purchases currently recognized as liabilities on the balance sheet 
the timing of payment of these purchase obligations is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending upon the time of receipt of goods and services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
d benefit plan obligations of million include estimated future contribution and benefit payments under the company s defined benefit and post retirement medical and life insurance plans  to the extent the plans are not sufficiently funded 
see note  benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion of the company s benefit plan obligations 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to satisfy these contractual obligations and commitments and that the ultimate payments associated with these commitments will not have a material adverse effect on its liquidity position 
risk factors safe harbor for forward looking statements 
we have made forward looking statements in this annual report including in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  other written or oral statements that constitute forward looking statements may be made by or on behalf of the company 
although we have based these statements on the beliefs and assumptions of our management and on information currently available to them  they are subject to risks and uncertainties 
we wish to ensure that such statements are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements  so as to obtain the protections of the safe harbor established in the private securities litigation reform act of accordingly  such statements are qualified by reference to the discussion below of certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in such forward looking statements 
we caution the reader that the list of factors may not be exhaustive 
we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new risk factors emerge from time to time 
we cannot predict such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact  if any  of such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
accordingly  undue reliance should not be put on any forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following risks and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 

table of contents over the last three years the company has completed several acquisitions and may continue to make acquisitions in the future 
the company believes that these acquisitions provide strategic growth opportunities for the company 
the company s failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating acquisitions or to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
realizing the benefits of acquisitions will depend on the company s ability to successfully integrate acquisitions with its existing operations 
the company s inability to successfully integrate operations in a timely manner may result in the company not realizing the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions 
the integration of companies is a complex  time consuming and expensive process that could significantly disrupt our business 
the anticipated benefits and synergies of acquisitions are based on projections and assumptions  not actual experience  and assume a successful integration 
in addition  the company s ability to realize these benefits and synergies could be adversely impacted by practical or legal constraints on our ability to combine operations or implement workforce reductions and by risks relating to potential unknown liabilities 
the challenges involved in successfully integrating acquisitions include consolidating and rationalizing information systems  manufacturing operations  combining product offerings  coordinating and rationalizing research and development activities  preserving distribution  marketing or other important relationships  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees  and coordinating and combining overseas operations  relationships and facilities  which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws and regulations 
deterioration of the wireless infrastructure industry could lead to reductions in capital spending budgets by wireless operators and original equipment manufacturers  which could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and income 
our revenues and gross margins will depend significantly on the overall demand for wireless infrastructure subsystems products 
a reduction in capital spending budgets by wireless operators and original equipment manufacturers caused by an economic downturn or otherwise could lead to a softening in demand for our products and services  which could result in a decrease in revenues and earnings 
the telecommunications industry has experienced significant consolidation  and this trend is expected to continue 
it is possible that we and one or more of our competitors each supply products to the companies that have merged or will merge 
this consolidation could result in further delays in purchasing decisions by merged companies or in us playing a decreased role in the supply of products to the merged companies 
delays or reductions in wireless infrastructure spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and  consequently  our results of operations  prospects and stock price 
because we depend on several large customers for a significant portion of our sales  our sales  operating margins and income would be adversely affected by any disruption of our relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in their businesses 
we depend on several large oems and wireless service providers for a significant portion of our business 
in  the top customers accounted for of sales 
the most significant of these customers are lucent technologies and at t wireless 
lucent technologies was the only customer that accounted for more than of sales in any disruption of our relationships with lucent or at t wireless  including any adverse modification of our supply agreements with them or the unwillingness or inability of either of them to perform its obligations under its supply agreement  would adversely affect our sales  operating margins and income 
in addition  any material adverse change in the financial condition of lucent or at t wireless  or in expenditures by lucent on rf power amplifiers or by at t wireless on network geolocation products and services  would have similar adverse effects 
our revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights 
we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and similar laws in other countries  and agreements with our employees  customers  partners and other parties  to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations 
however  any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or our intellectual property rights may not provide competitive advantages  which could significantly harm our business 
also  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the wireless industry  a portion of our business and our products may rely on key technologies developed by third parties  and we may not be able to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all 
third parties also may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights 
even if we do not believe that our products or business are infringing upon third parties intellectual property rights  the claims can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter into costly settlement or license agreements 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source  our sales  operating margins and income could suffer 

table of contents continuing and future sales opportunities for our geolocation products and services are uncertain  and if we cannot develop such opportunities  our sales and income will be reduced 
the federal communications commission has promulgated regulations requiring wireless communications carriers to provide caller location information for wireless calls 
the systems by which this location information is supplied are often described as e solutions 
the company offers network based geolocation products and services that enable carriers to effectively implement network based e solutions 
changes in technology and regulations  or our inability to meet customers evolving requirements  could affect our ability to develop continuing and future sales opportunities for network based geolocation products and services 
in addition  the company s historically largest customer for geolocation products has been at t wireless  which recently merged with cingular wireless who has historically used a competitor s geolocation products 
if we cannot develop sales opportunities for geolocation products  continue to meet customer requirements  or successfully market our products to the combined at t wireless and cingular wireless  sales and income will be adversely impacted 
a substantial portion of our sales is outside the united states 
conducting business in international markets involves risks and uncertainties such as foreign exchange rate exposure and political and economic instability that could lead to reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales  which would reduce our sales and income 
a significant portion of our sales is outside the united states  and in recent years we have significantly increased our international manufacturing capabilities 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales and that continued growth and profitability will require further international expansion 
identifiable foreign exchange rate exposures result primarily from currency fluctuations  accounts receivable from customer sales  the anticipated purchase of products from affiliates and third party suppliers and the repayment of inter company loans denominated in foreign currencies with our foreign subsidiaries 
international business risks also include political and economic instability  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer customer payment cycles  burdensome taxes  restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  expropriation or requirements of local or shared ownership  compliance with local laws and regulations  terrorist attacks  developing legal systems  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  cultural and language differences  and difficulties in managing and staffing operations 
we believe that international risks and uncertainties could lead to reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales  which would reduce our sales and income 
the competitive pressures we face could lead to reduced demand or lower prices for our products and services in favor of our competitors products and services  which could harm our sales  gross margins and prospects 
we encounter aggressive competition from a variety of competitors in all areas of our business  and compete primarily on the basis of technology  performance  price  quality  reliability  brand  distribution  customer service and support 
if we fail to develop new products and services  periodically enhance our existing products and services  or otherwise compete successfully  it would reduce our sales and prospects 
further  we may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive 
if we cannot reduce our costs in response to competitive price pressures  our gross margins would decline 
if we cannot continue to rapidly develop  manufacture and market innovative products and services that meet customer requirements for performance and reliability  we may lose market share and our revenues may suffer 
the process of developing new wireless technology products and services is complex and uncertain  and failure to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately and to develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property could significantly harm our results of operations 
we must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our investments will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
after a product is developed  we must be able to manufacture sufficient volumes quickly and at low costs 
to accomplish this  we must accurately forecast volumes  mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements  which we may not be able to do successfully 
among the factors that make a smooth transition from current products to new products difficult are delays in product development or manufacturing  variations in product costs  delays in customer purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product introductions and customer demand for the new product 
our revenues and gross margins may suffer if we cannot make such a transition effectively and also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors 
this is especially challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction 
furthermore  sales of our new products may replace sales of some of our current products  offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction 
if we incur delays in new product introductions  or do not accurately estimate the market effects of new product introductions  given the competitive nature of our industry  future demand for our products and our revenues may be seriously harmed 
the price of our outstanding securities may suffer if we cannot control fluctuations in our sales and operating results 
historically  our quarterly and annual sales and operating results have fluctuated 
we expect fluctuations to continue in the 
table of contents future 
in addition to general economic and political conditions  the following factors affect our sales the timing of significant customer orders  our inability to forecast future sales due to our just in time supply approach  changes in competitive pricing  wide variations in profitability by product line  variations in operating expenses  the timing of announcements or introductions of new products by us  our competitors or our respective customers  the acceptance of those products  relative variations in manufacturing efficiencies and costs  and the relative strength or weakness of international markets 
since our quarterly and annual sales and operating results vary  we believe that period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful  and you should not rely on those comparisons as indicators of our future performance 
due to the foregoing factors  it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters our revenues or operating results will not meet the expectations of the public stock market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline 
if we cannot continue to attract and retain highly qualified people our revenues  gross margin and income may suffer 
we believe that our future success significantly depends on our ability to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified management  technical and marketing personnel 
the competition for these individuals is intense 
from time to time  there may be a shortage of skilled labor  which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract  motivate and retain qualified employees 
we believe our inability to do so could negatively impact the demand for our products and services and consequently our financial condition and operating results 
our costs and business prospects may be affected by increased government regulation  a factor which is largely beyond our control 
we are not directly regulated in the us  but many of our us customers and the telecommunications industry generally are subject to federal communications commission regulation 
in overseas markets  there are generally similar governmental agencies that regulate our customers 
we believe that regulatory changes could have a significant negative effect on our business and operating results by restricting our customers development efforts  making current products obsolete or increasing competition 
our customers must obtain regulatory approvals to operate certain of our products 
any failure or delay by any of our customers to obtain these approvals would adversely impact our ability to sell our products 
the enactment by governments of new laws or regulations or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations could adversely affect the market for our products 
the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for such products  generally following extensive investigation and deliberation over competing technologies 
in the past  the delays inherent in this governmental approval process have caused  and may in the future cause  the cancellation or postponement of the deployment of new technologies 
these delays could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  gross margins and income 
allegations of health risks from wireless equipment may negatively affect our results of operations 
allegations of health risks from the electromagnetic fields generated by base stations and mobile handsets  and the lawsuits and publicity relating to them  regardless of merit  could affect our operations negatively by leading consumers to reduce their use of mobile phones or by causing us to allocate resources to these issues 
the price of our common stock historically has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock historically has experienced and may continue to experience high volatility  and the broader stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years 
some of the factors that can affect our stock price are actual  or market expectations of  fluctuations in capital spending by wireless operators and original equipment manufacturers on wireless infrastructure  the announcement of new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors  continued variability in our revenue or earnings  changes in quarterly revenue or earnings estimates for us made by the investment community  delays or postponements of wireless infrastructure deployments  including g technology  regardless of whether such deployments have an actual impact on our orders or sales  and speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position  financial condition  results of operations  business or significant transactions 
general market conditions and domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance may also affect the price of our common stock 
for these reasons  investors should not rely on historical trends to predict future stock prices or financial results 
in addition  following periods of volatility in a company s securities  securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of 
table of contents management time and resources 
we anticipate that we will continue to face these types of risks 
beginning in  the sarbanes oxley act of the act has required the company to comply with numerous provisions focused on upgraded disclosures and corporate governance  increasing the company s cost and complexity of being a public company 
beginning in  section of the act will require the company to include an internal control report of management in its annual report on form k 
the internal control report must contain a statement of management s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting  a statement identifying the framework used by management to conduct the required evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its most recent fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not internal control over financial reporting is effective  and a statement that the company s independent auditors have issued an attestation report on management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
management acknowledges its responsibility for internal controls over financial reporting and seeks to continually improve those controls 
in addition  in order to achieve compliance with section of the act within the prescribed period  the company has been engaged in a process to document and evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting 
in this regard  management has dedicated internal resources  engaged outside consultants and adopted a detailed work plan to i assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting  ii take steps to improve control processes where appropriate  iii validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and iv implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting 
the company believes its process for documenting  evaluating and monitoring its internal control over financial reporting is consistent with the objectives of section of the act 
there is a risk that the company  or its independent auditors  will not be able to conclude at september  that the company s internal controls over financial reporting are effective as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we believe the inability to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act could negatively impact investor confidence and the company s stock price 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk andrew is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodities as follows interest rate risk the company had million in debt outstanding at september  in the form of debt agreements at both fixed and variable rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its variable rate debt  which totaled million or of the company s total debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
andrew currently does not use derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk the company s international operations represent a substantial portion of its overall operating results and asset base 
in many cases  the company s products are produced at manufacturing facilities in foreign countries to support sales in those markets 
during fiscal year  sales of products exported from the united states or manufactured abroad were of total sales 
the company s identifiable foreign exchange rate exposures result primarily from accounts receivable from customer sales  anticipated purchases of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
the company primarily manages its foreign currency risk by making use of naturally offsetting positions that include the establishment of local manufacturing facilities that conduct business in local currency 
the company also selectively utilizes derivative instruments such as forward exchange contracts to manage the risk of exchange fluctuation 
these instruments held by the company are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
the company estimates that a hypothetical increase or decrease in all non us dollar currencies would have increased or decreased reported net income by approximately million in commodity risk the company uses various metals in the production of its products 
copper  which is used to manufacture coaxial cable  is the most significant of these metals 
as a result  the company is exposed to fluctuations in the price of copper 
in order to reduce this exposure  the company has entered into contracts with various suppliers to purchase approximately half of its forecasted copper requirements for fiscal year at september  the company had contracts to purchase million pounds of copper for million 
the company estimates that a change in the price of copper would have had a million impact on cost of products sold 
also  the company uses certain petro chemicals for cable coatings  and a change in the price of petro chemicals would have had an estimated million impact on cost of products sold 
the company uses steel for the production of antenna and other products  and a change in the price of steel would have had an estimated million impact on cost of products sold
