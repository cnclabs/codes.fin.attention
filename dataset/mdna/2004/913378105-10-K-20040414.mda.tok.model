selected evolution ceramic disc pads as their parts plus ceramic disc pad line in october ceramic disc pad sales exceeded million dollars in and are expected to double in we operate a state of the art brake rotor manufacturing plant at our alsip  illinois facility 
we recently completed the relocation of the kelsey hayes brake rotor plant from carson  california to our alsip facility 
the consolidation of the two plants has eliminated and or reduced redundant labor and certain fixed costs 
we primarily manufacture brake rotors for our branded product offering 
we believe that in order to satisfy the customer s request for maximum quality at the most competitive economics  we must have the flexibility to manufacture or source primarily from china brake rotors and drums 
we believe the brake rotors we manufacture in the usa are superior in quality and value to the same parts supplied through plants located in china and add value to our customer relationships  providing us with a competitive edge over competitors who are exclusively marketers of imported brake drums and rotors 
we also believe that we have improved our ability to source product in china through our strategic relationship with wanxiang america corporation  china s leading auto parts supplier to the oem and aftermarket 
see further detail regarding our relationship with wanxiang america corporation under line of credit and recent financings 
we acquired our brake caliper manufacturing business in the kelsey hayes transaction 
the brake caliper manufacturing plant is operated out of our carson  california distribution center  formerly operated by kelsey hayes company 
calipers are used in the disc braking system 
we offer semi loaded and loaded calipers  loaded calipers are calipers that include the disc pads and associated hardware 
the trend over the last year has favored growth in the private label segment as customers choose to support their own brands 
we believe there has been a shift over the last several years by national buying groups and retailers to build their brand equity as opposed to supporting the big three brake manufacturing companies dana  federal mogul and honeywell and their brands 
however  the addition of our new brands will enable us to service that segment of the automotive aftermarket that desires nationally respected and trusted  branded product 
with the additional product lines  product line coverage and respected brands we have positioned ourselves as one of the only full line alternatives to the big three brake companies 
our other competitors specialize primarily in one brake category which makes it more difficult for a customer to manage one supplier for each category from a marketing  supply and inventory management function 
we believe there are substantial new growth opportunities by the way of cross selling related to the recent acquisition 
our customer base has more then doubled in number and our product line offering has increased  offering opportunities for new sales initiatives 
we are hopeful of selling the new product lines acquired in the kelsey hayes transaction to existing customers such as parts plus  national pronto association and independent auto parts association  in which we are an approved supplier for two or more brake categories 
industry background braking systems 
there are two primary types of braking systems for cars and light trucks 
the first is a drum brake system  in which the braking action is created by a brake shoe being forced outward against the inside of a rotating drum 
the second  and newer  system is a disc braking system  in which the braking action is created by two brake pads squeezing a rotor 
each vehicle has either one drum or one rotor at each wheel 
in either case  the braking is initiated by the driver pressing a brake pedal  which causes a master cylinder to compress fluid in the vehicle s braking system  which  in turn  causes the fluid pressure to pass through a brake line to a hydraulic cylinder which causes the action of the brake shoes in a drum system or brake pads in a disc system 
distribution in the aftermarket 
the ultimate consumers for automotive aftermarket products can be divided into two primary categories 
the first category consists of customers who choose to have their cars repaired at a commercial service establishment  such as a service station  repair shop or car dealer  and is known as the installer segment 
customers in the second category  the do it yourself segment  are those customers who choose to make the repairs themselves 
traditionally  many car parts have been distributed though a system under which products are sold from manufacturers to warehouse distributors  who then sell to jobbers  who  in turn  sell to installers and consumers 
we believe that in recent years there has been an industry shift away from the traditional channels of distribution toward alternative distribution channels  including manufacturers who sell parts to mass market retailers who serve do it yourself customers  and manufacturers who sell parts to warehouse distributors  who sell directly to installers that provide repair and installation services 
we believe the traditional warehouse jobber distribution system has suffered  and may continue to suffer  some erosion of total market share as a result of the expansion of these alternative distribution channels  particularly as a result of the increased presence in the marketplace of the mass market retailer 
however  we believe that these shifts in distribution channels will benefit us  as our principal brake parts customers include these mass market retailers 
frost sullivan estimates that sales of brake parts in the united states aftermarket for passenger cars  sports utility vehicles and light trucks totaled billion measured at manufacturer s level in this market grew by an estimated in  according to frost sullivan 
we believe the demand for aftermarket brake parts  will continue to grow because of the following factors o an increasing number of vehicles on the road 
new car sales were strong from through  we expect vehicles sold during this time period to require replacement parts in to o an aging vehicle population  which creates the need for more replacement parts 
the average age of light vehicles has been increasing since in the average age of a light vehicle is forecasted at years according to frost sullivan 
o increased production of front wheel drive vehicles  which create more wear on brake parts than rear wheel drive vehicles 
over of all new vehicles are designed with front wheel drive 
o a trend toward the use of affordable replacement brake rotors rather than resurfacing existing rotors 
historically  due to the high cost of new rotors  consumers and installers generally chose to resurface brake rotors rather than purchase replacement rotors 
however  due to the availability of lower cost replacement rotors  in recent years  consumers and installers are increasingly choosing to purchase replacement rotors 
o modern design innovations  including the automotive industry s shift to the production of an increased number of lighter weight rotors and metallic brake pads 
the newer metallic brake pads are abrasive and wear rotor surfaces much faster than the non metallic pads used in the past 
lighter weight rotors are less costly than heavier rotors  and  when the rotors have worn down  it is generally more cost effective to discard rather than refurbish them 
our growth strategy our strategy is to capitalize on the increasing demand for brake and undercar parts by being a highly focused competitive preferred brake parts supplier to the automotive aftermarket excelling in quality and delivery 
we will distinguish ourselves by being first to market  and providing solutions to problematic applications 
o selling more product to our more then customers by marketing additional brake and undercar categories  with the objective of becoming our customer s sole or primary source for their branded and private label brake and undercar requirements 
o new product launches 
we believe that products can be improved to perform better then the original equipment part  our focus is to deliver outstanding new products with feature and benefits that exceed our competition and the original equipment part 
o expansion of our high performance powerstop products 
sales of high margin powerstop products to sport and tuner car markets offer new and exciting growth opportunities 
o adding value by growing brand equity 
we are targeting sales to the professional installer markets 
o continuing to address the growing demand for customers private labels across all of our product lines 
o considering the acquisition of other specialty brake parts distributors and manufacturers 
products the brake parts we sell can be divided into two main categories brake system and undercar parts 
the brake system parts consists of friction  hydraulic and rotating parts brake rotor and drum parts 
the undercar parts consist of clutches and suspension parts 
the friction category of parts consists of brake shoes for drum systems and brake pads for disc systems 
cylinders  brake calipers and brake hoses are examples of hydraulic parts 
we manufacture some of these parts and act as a distributor for others 
we manufacture disc brake rotors in our alsip  illinois facility 
the kelsey hayes rotor manufacturing plant was closed in december and production was moved to our alsip  illinois facility during the first quarter of we formulate and manufacture disc brake pads at our plant  located in brampton  ontario  canada 
at our plant in walkerton  virginia  we manufacture  brake shoes and drum brake lining 
calipers are remanufactured in our carson  california plant 
the remaining hydraulic parts we sell are all purchased from suppliers 
we also offer a line of high performance brake parts marketed under our powerstop brand 
the powerstop offering includes slotted and drilled brake rotors manufactured in our alsip  illinois facility  powerstop extreme performance disc pads and brake calipers 
these products are primarily sold to specialty performance distributors who in turn sell them directly to the consumer 
in the future we intend to expand our powerstop product offering with additional brake and undercar performance products 
we now supply a complete line of branded and private label brake and undercar parts to mass market retailers  traditional warehouse distributors and specialty undercar distributors in north america 
many of our competitors specialize in only one category  such as friction parts or drums and rotors 
by offering a full line of products in several categories  we believe we have an advantage over those competitors offering products in fewer categories  in light of the industry trend toward consolidation of the number of suppliers of products 
wholesale product operation we conduct a wholesale product operation from our headquarters facility in alsip  illinois  purchasing automotive items such as spark plugs  motor oil and freon  in large volume  at below market prices  and reselling these products at slightly higher prices 
we make large volume purchases of products on the open market  generally buying from domestic and foreign manufacturers and other warehouse distributors  and reselling these products to other warehouse distributors  mass market retailers and jobbers 
these operations  while historically profitable  result in gross margins that are significantly lower than gross margins from our brake part operation 
for the years ended december   and  excluding sales from our former hungarian foundry  net sales from our wholesale product operations accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales  and  and  respectively  of our total gross profits 
marketing and distribution marketing we organize our marketing operations around two principal customer groups traditional aftermarket warehouse distributors and mass market retailers 
private label brake parts customers 
we are one of the industry s leading providers of private label brake and undercar products  approximately  are sold under our customers private brand labels 
most aftermarket distributors are members of national buying marketing groups and have developed their own private brand labels 
we supply one or more brake product lines to the following marketing groups under the group s private label national pronto association  iapa  apa  and parts plus  inc we also supply national retailers such as advance auto parts under their private brand labels 
branded product customers 
branded products are primarily targeted at the professional installer customer 
we are building brand awareness through trade magazine promotions  training clinics and world class products 
sales marketing 
our vice president of sales manages our independent sales representative network through nine full time sales personnel 
a vice president marketing manages our marketing and product branding efforts 
we believe we have retained some of the best independent sales representatives across the country 
these representatives assist us with direct sales efforts  customer field work  trade shows and other marketing and sales activities 
these independent sales representatives are compensated on a commission basis 
agreements with our independent sales representatives may be terminated at any time by either party  upon varying periods of notice dependent on the contract 
distribution we believe we offer the quickest delivery service of any full line national brake and undercar supplier in the us aftermarket through three strategically located distribution centers 
we service our midwest customers from a  square foot distribution center at our headquarters facility located in alsip  illinois 
our east coast customers are serviced from the former kelsey hayes  square foot parsippany  nj warehouse 
we service our west coast customers from the former kelsey hayes  square foot distribution facility in carson  california 
we consolidated our former  square foot southern california warehouse into the kelsey hayes facility in march of we generally are able to fulfill customer orders quickly  as the industry demands  and  therefore  typically do not have a large order backlog 
we generally ship orders to our brake parts customers within hours days from the time the order is placed 
in addition  we seek to maintain high fill rates for orders  and  accordingly  do not generally have a large number of back orders 
customers may place their stock orders by telephone  electronically or by facsimile 
deliveries are made from all warehouses  almost exclusively by common carrier 
manufacturing in the first quarter of  in order to reduce costs  we relocated the former kelsey hayes rotor machining facility from carson  california to our alsip  illinois facility  which was closer to our castings supplier 
at present we have a capacity to machine approximately  rotors annually on a one shift basis 
in  we acquired north american friction  which at the time occupied a  square foot facility near toronto  ontario 
today  as a result of significant growth in the sales of friction products since we entered that market segment this operation currently occupies a  square foot facility in suburban toronto  ontario 
we now offer a full line of friction grades in both riveted and integrally molded disc brake pads 
we were awarded iso certification in july and beep brake effectiveness evaluation procedure certification in beep is becoming the industry benchmark to assess friction material performance 
we acquired the total brake industries assets in november and operate these assets from a  square foot leased facility in walkerton  virginia 
this facility remanufactures brake shoes and brake shoe lining for use in this remanufacturing process 
in addition  we sell drum brake shoe lining to third party customers 
we acquired the brake caliper manufacturing business from kelsey hayes in january the brake caliper manufacturing plant is operated out of our carson  california distribution center formerly operated by kelsey hayes 
this plant remanufactures brake calipers 
calipers are used in the disc braking system 
we offer semi loaded and loaded calipers  loaded calipers are calipers that include the disc pads and associated hardware 
suppliers and raw materials suppliers we centralize product selection and purchasing functions for our warehouse distribution business at our headquarters located in alsip  illinois 
most of the drums  rotors and hydraulic parts we sell are purchased from a variety of suppliers 
we manufacture the vast majority of the friction parts that we sell 
currently  of the drums and rotors we purchase  approximately are manufactured in the peoples republic of china and the remainder in taiwan  italy  canada and the united states 
in connection with a transaction under which we issued  shares of series a preferred stock to venture equities management  inc  an affiliate of wanxiang america corporation and wanxiang group corporation  one of the leading manufacturers of automotive parts in the peoples republic of china  we entered into a supply agreement with wanxiang america corporation 
under the supply agreement  we agreed to make annual purchases of parts from wanxiang america corporation totaling  provided the prices of the products we purchase from wanxiang america are substantially comparable to the prices charged by other suppliers in the peoples republic of china for similar products 
in the event we do not purchase  in products from wanxiang america in a year  we are obligated under the agreement to pay wanxiang america of the difference between  and the amount we have purchased from wanxiang america for products during the year 
the agreement provides wanxiang america with a right of refusal with respect to products we seek to purchase from other suppliers located in the peoples republic of china 
the supply agreement has an indefinite term  but can be terminated by wanxiang america at any time and by us if wanxiang america materially fails to perform its obligations under the agreement  or if the number of shares of our common stock underlying the shares of series a preferred stock owned by venture equities management falls below a specified level 
during we fulfilled our purchase requirements with wanxiang 
none of our suppliers provide a majority or all of our requirements for a particular product or product subcategory 
the international trade commission has ruled that rotor sales from china materially injured us rotor manufacturers 
as a result of this determination  the us customs service has imposed anti dumping duties on some chinese suppliers 
these duties can be reviewed annually if requested by a chinese manufacturer or by a us brake rotor manufacturer and depending on the results of the review  the tariff may be decreased or increased 
the dumping duties are plant specific and are retroactive to the importer of record 
however  we are not the importer of record for this purpose and  therefore  to date  have not been affected by dumping duties 
raw materials the main components used in our brake rotor manufacturing operations are iron castings 
we primarily purchase castings from waupaca foundry  inc  based in wisconsin 
the prices of castings fluctuate based on the scrap metal and energy costs 
in the most recent three year period  these prices have generally stayed within a range of below to above the price at the beginning of the period 
in addition to waupaca foundry  we purchase castings from a foundry in canada 
although we believe that we have developed good relationships with the foundries that supply our iron castings  any of these foundries could discontinue producing these castings for us at any time 
we believe that the number of foundries equipped to produce iron castings such as the ones used by us in our manufacturing operations is limited 
the loss of any major foundry as a supplier of iron castings and our inability to identify new foundries for the production of iron castings in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we cannot provide assurances that the foundries currently producing our iron castings will be able to accommodate the anticipated expansion of our manufacturing capabilities 
we are continuously seeking to locate additional foundries that would be suitable for the production of our iron castings 
corporate history our wholly owned subsidiary  universal automotive  inc  an illinois corporation  began operations in as a warehouse distributor of a wide variety of automotive aftermarket replacement parts servicing the chicago area market 
we were incorporated in delaware in january to act as the holding company for several subsidiaries 
in the early s  we started shifting our focus to the brake parts segment of the business  and in we elected to discontinue our non brake parts warehouse distributor operations due to the lower margins and declining growth prospects of this segment of the business 
in january  we began to operate the wholesale products operation under a new wholly owned subsidiary  the automotive commodity connection  inc we currently conduct our business through the following subsidiaries o universal automotive  inc  o universal brake parts  inc  an ontario  canada corporation  o universal automotive of virginia  inc  a virginia corporation  and o the automotive commodity connection  inc  an illinois corporation 
our principal executive offices are located at south central  alsip  il  and our telephone number is discontinued operations we have discontinued the operations of two other subsidiaries 
the first is eparts exchange  inc  which was discontinued in and which was unsuccessful in developing a business to business online exchange for automotive aftermarket parts 
we have consolidated the telemarketing and outbound e mail operations of eparts exchange into our core business 
the second subsidiary is ubp hungary  inc  a delaware corporation  which we own and which owned ubp csepel iron foundry  kft  a hungarian corporation  which operates a foundry in budapest  hungary 
we sold our ownership interest in ubp csepel as of december  we decided to exit the foundry business in due to continuing losses at the foundry and our belief that our stable relationship with waupaca foundry eliminated the need to develop an in house capacity for manufacturing rotor castings 
in our financial statements  we wrote down the carrying value of the foundry property to its estimated net realizable value 
we also provided a reserve for costs of disposal and losses of the foundry before its disposal or liquidation 
we wrote off the balance of this investment in see business discontinued operations 
competition our markets are highly competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of service  price  inventory availability  delivery time and responsiveness 
we offer a full line of brake and undercar parts 
we compete directly with other companies that offer full or multiple product offerings as well as single category value line distributors 
we believe our complete product offering gives us an advantage over single line competitors and  thus provides an attractive alternative to the full line big three competitors 
according to frost sullivan  a leading industry analyst  the big three brake companies  dana corporation raybestos  federal mogul wagner brake products and honeywell bendix comprised an estimated of the brake parts aftermarket in we believe the high concentration of business among the big three favors us for the following reasons dana corporation has publicly stated its desire to divest itself of its aftermarket business which includes its raybestos brake product line  which accounts for the largest share of the aftermarket brake business  a market share 
the president of the raybestos brake business resigned earlier in he joined an aftermarket remanufacturer and subsequently has been joined by other key executives of the raybestos brake business 
federal mogul accounts for the second largest share of the aftermarket brake business  a market share  and voluntarily filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in october honeywell  with a market share  has had their original equipment and aftermarket brake business for sale for the last three years  has now stated the business is not for sale 
it appears that among the leading full line aftermarket brake suppliers  this is a time of uncertainty 
we also compete with single category value line friction suppliers such as morse automotive and satisfied brake 
both companies are highly respected competitors that account for to  respectively  of the friction aftermarket according to frost sullivan report 
we believe our full line offering offers an advantage for many customers who utilize these single line competitors through our full product line offering while effectively competing with products we believe are of comparable quality  price and value 
intellectual property we believe that our historic labels  ubp and ultimate  are important to our marketing efforts 
the ubp and ultimate braking power trademarks have been registered with the united states patent and trademark office and canadian trademarks office 
the powerstop  valumaxx and autospeciality brands  acquired from kelsey hayes  and our license of the trw brand in certain applications  also represent trademarks that have been federally registered 
we cannot provide assurance that prior registrations or uses of these trademarks  or confusingly similar marks  do not exist in the united states 
if prior registrations or uses exist  we might be precluded from using these trademarks in the united states 
we cannot provide assurance that our trademarks would be upheld if challenged or that we would not be prevented from using the trademarks  either of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the formulations for our integrally molded brake pads  pucks and drum brake lining are trade secrets  which we maintain as confidential information 
we believe these trade secrets to be valuable 
we could be subject to claims by others that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
any litigation regarding our proprietary rights could be costly and divert our management s attention from our operations  result in the loss of certain of our proprietary rights or the payment of substantial monetary damages  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from selling our products

o on october  as an inducement for finova to approve the additional financing from laurus master funds  we amended the subordinated debenture

risk factors in evaluating us and our business  you should carefully consider the following risk factors 
this report contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
the order in which the following risks are presented is not intended to represent the magnitude of the risks described 
we have not earned profits and cannot assure you that we will become profitable 
from through  we lost a total of approximately  including losses from our hungarian foundry and eparts exchange operations  which were sold as of the end of although was a profitable year  we incurred losses in excess of  in we have a plan for achieving profitability which involves improving our balance sheet  gaining market share in the market for friction brake products  enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  improving brand awareness for our products and developing new  higher margin friction products 
see business our strategy 
however  we cannot assure you that this plan will succeed and  if it does not  we may not achieve or sustain profitability 
we have a substantial amount of debt  which could reduce our ability to expand our business and limit our financial flexibility 
we have now  and will continue to have a significant amount of debt 
as of december   giving effect to the restructuring of a subordinated debenture held by finova mezzanine capital inc and the new debt issued to laurus and global  we had approximately million in debt  and stockholders equity of approximately million 
our debt to equity ratio was therefore approximately seven times 
in connection with the kelsey hayes acquisition we acquired significant assets by increasing our borrowings through a combination of a significantly larger line of credit with congress financial and a series of convertible debt financings with two separate lenders  which significantly increased our leverage and debt to equity ratio 
the amount of our debt could have important consequences to you 
for example  it could o increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures  product development efforts and other general corporate requirements  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  o place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors who have less debt  o limit our ability to pay dividends  o limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to our debt  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  and o make it more difficult for us to complete acquisitions 
if we are unable to maintain our line of credit or service our convertible debt  or if interest rates should rise significantly  this could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition 
we have a line of credit under a credit agreement we entered into with congress financial corporation 
we depend significantly on the line of credit to fund our purchases of inventory  payroll  freight charges  commission expenses and other expenses 
the line of credit is scheduled to expire on january  we may not be able to renew this line of credit  or obtain another line of credit  on similar terms  if at all 
if we cannot renew this line of credit or obtain a replacement line of credit  this will significantly impair our ability to fund our operations 
if we are able to renew this line of credit or obtain a replacement line of credit only on less favorable terms  the increased interest expense or other costs of the new line of credit will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability 
additionally  our line of credit contains several covenants which are tied to our operations and certain financial ratios 
should we breach any of these covenants  there is a potential that the lender will seek to terminate the line of credit 
our line of credit with congress financial corporation and our loan agreements with our three convertible debt lenders and with finova all have cross default provisions  as well as affirmative and negative covenants  which require consent for certain actions and prohibit certain other actions without their consent 
we must use great caution to ensure that none of these negative or affirmative covenants are triggered  to avoid default under all the loans 
this may in certain instances restrict the scope of our activities  to the extent we are unable to obtain the lenders consent 
our ability to grow and improve our financial performance depends on factors such as our ability to gain additional market share  expansion of our manufacturing capabilities  possible acquisitions of other manufacturers or distributors and increasing sales to existing customers 
our ability to grow and improve our financial performance will depend in part on the following factors o our ability to gain additional market share for friction brake products  o the purchase of additional manufacturing machinery and brake rotor molds to increase the different types of brake rotors we manufacture  o the possible acquisition of other brake parts manufacturers or distributors on favorable terms  and o our ability to increase sales to current customers and maintain or increase our profit margins with them 
while we regularly evaluate and discuss possible acquisitions  we have not entered into any commitment  agreement or understanding with any potential acquisition candidates  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating suitable acquisition candidates or that any additional acquisitions will be completed in the future 
see item  business our strategy 
in addition  we cannot assure that any operations that we may acquire can be effectively and profitably integrated into our business  or that any future expansion of our operations or acquisitions will not have a negative effect on our operating results  particularly during the periods immediately following any expansion or acquisition 
trading in our common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market may be terminated on january   nasdaq notified us that our stock price had dropped below per share and that if the trading price did not increase to over per share for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days by july   nasdaq would initiate proceedings to cause our common stock to be delisted from trading on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we were able to maintain our nasdaq listing due to a subsequent rise in our stock price  however  there is an ongoing risk of delisting should our stock price decline in the future 
we may also be subject to a risk of nasdaq delisting if we fail to maintain a minimum net worth of at least  and the value of the public float on our common stock is less than  in the event of a delisting  our shares could only be traded on over the counter bulletin board system 
this method of trading could significantly impair our ability to raise new capital and adversely impede future trading of our stock 
in addition  it could result in increased dilution to shareholders  due to the rights of our convertible note lenders to convert their loans into an increasing number of shares linked to declines in share price 
in the event that our common stock was delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  we likely would become subject to special rules  called penny stock rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell our common stock 
the rules require  among other things  the delivery  prior to the transaction  of a disclosure schedule required by the securities and exchange commission relating to the market for penny stocks 
the broker dealer also must disclose the commissions payable both to the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities  and monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information 
in the event that our common stock becomes characterized as a penny stock  our market liquidity could be severely affected 
the regulations relating to penny stocks could limit the ability of broker dealers to sell our common stock and the ability of owners of our common stock to sell shares in the secondary market 
our ability to expand our business depends on our obtaining additional financing  and there is no guarantee we will be able to obtain this financing 
we will be required to seek additional financing to fund any expansion we undertake through acquisitions or the upgrade of existing facilities 
we have no current commitments or arrangements for additional financing and we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may also issue common stock or other securities in connection with future acquisitions  resulting in additional dilution to existing stockholders 
the automotive industry is cyclical  and a downturn in the industry could have a substantial negative effect on our business 
our business is dependent upon sales of the automotive industry  which creates the total number of vehicles available for repair 
this industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
these downturns are difficult to predict and in the past have not had an immediate impact on the aftermarket 
the primary market for replacement parts is vehicles that have been on the road for at least five years 
although we believe that downturns in the industry generally benefit us because they result in longer holding periods for cars and further wear and tear on brakes  a protracted downturn in the automotive industry could have a negative effect on the performance of the aftermarket parts industry in general and our performance in particular 
our future performance may be harmed by automotive industry downturns 
our business will suffer if we cannot successfully compete with other companies in our industry  many of whom have far greater resources than us 
our markets are highly competitive 
as a brake parts manufacturer and distributor  we compete directly with other brake parts manufacturers and distributors  including aimco and raybestos brake products  which are divisions of dana corporation  wagner brake products  a division of federal mogul  and bendix  a division of honeywell 
we also compete with numerous value line distributors specializing in one or more specific brake categories  including morse automotive and satisfied brake 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater capital  management and other resources than we have  and we cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully with these businesses 
our success depends on the continued services of key personnel 
our continued success will depend to a significant degree upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management  particularly yehuda tzur  our chairman of the board  and arvin scott  our president and chief executive officer 
if we were to lose the services of mr 
tzur or mr 
scott  this could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have employment agreements with mr 
tzur and mr 
scott 
our supplies of raw materials and finished goods could be disrupted for a variety of reasons  and any disruption would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the primary components used in our brake rotor manufacturing operations are raw iron castings 
most of the finished rotor castings are purchased from china and most of our raw iron castings are produced by  and purchased from  one foundry located in wisconsin 
we duplicate raw iron casting molds used for the production of our better selling brake rotors  and place these molds primarily at this foundry 
although we believe that we have developed a good relationship with this foundry  it could discontinue producing these castings for us at any time 
the number of foundries equipped to produce raw iron castings such as the one used by us in our manufacturing operations is limited 
our inability to identify new foundries for the production of raw iron castings in a timely manner could have a substantial negative effect on our business 
we have historically sourced most of our finished product imports of drums and rotors from china 
in  our largest supplier of drums and rotors experienced a fire  which resulted in a disruption of supply of product  and our second largest supplier also experienced problems in timely delivery of product to us  which adversely impacted our ability to fill orders and resulted in the loss of certain customers 
since that time  we have resumed purchases from these suppliers and taken steps to ensure that similar supply chain interruption will not occur in the future  however  there can be no absolute assurances that this will be the case 
we have regained certain of the lost customers and have also developed new customers  however  this supply chain interruption had a significant impact on operations 
the imposition of anti dumping duties on products we import from china could substantially increase our costs and hamper our efforts to achieve profitability 
on march   a petition was filed before the united states department of commerce and international trade commission seeking the imposition of anti dumping duties on some brake drums and rotors imported from the people s republic of china 
the international trade commission later ruled that rotor sales from china materially injured united states manufacturers of rotors 
as a result of the decision by the international trade commission  the united states customs service has imposed anti dumping duties on several chinese suppliers 
see item  business suppliers and raw materials 
these duties are specific to particular plants at which rotors are manufactured  and  to date  none of the plants from which we purchase rotors has been subject to a duty 
however  if any of the plants from which we purchase rotors become subject to duties  this could increase our costs of purchasing these rotors and make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability 
we are obligated to purchase a substantial portion of our supplies from wanxiang america corporation  which could limit our ability to negotiate favorable terms with other suppliers 
in connection with the issuance of our series a preferred stock  we entered into a supply agreement with wanxiang america corporation  an affiliate of the purchaser of the series a preferred stock  which obligates us  with certain exceptions  to purchase at least  worth of products each year from wanxiang america  provided it is able to supply the products on substantially competitive terms 
see item  business suppliers and raw materials 
our obligations under this contract could have the effect of limiting our ability to negotiate favorable terms with other suppliers 
our executive officers and directors control a substantial minority block of our voting power and their interests may be different from yours and  as a result  you may have no effective voice in our management 
our executive officers and members of our board of directors  as a result of their ownership of common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock  beneficially own a significant minority percentage of our voting stock 
see item  security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
by virtue of this ownership  these individuals can exercise control over our business  policies and affairs and exert substantial influence over the election of our directors  and the approval or disapproval of actions requiring a shareholder vote 
accordingly  you may have no effective voice in our management 
this concentration of stock ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing  and may discourage attempts to bring about  a change in control or the removal of our existing management 
these negative effects would become even more likely if these members of our management and board of directors agreed to vote their shares in a similar manner as venture equities management  inc which  as discussed below  owns a substantial percentage of our voting stock 
venture equities management  inc  or vemi  by virtue of its holding  shares of series a preferred stock  currently convertible into  shares of our common stock subject to anti dilution adjustment rights  beneficially owns approximately of our voting stock assuming conversion of all preferred stock to common 
in connection with the issuance of the series a preferred stock  vemi and its affiliates were granted numerous rights  including vemi s right to designate two members of our board of directors 
as a result  vemi has significant influence over decisions on matters such as a change of control  the removal of our management or similar matters 
if vemi agreed to vote its shares in the same manner as the members of our management and board of directors  these shareholders would have the ability to ensure the approval of any of these types of decisions 
vemi also owns a default warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock which would become exercisable if any of several events of default  as defined in the default warrant  occur 
there are numerous events which would constitute an event of default under the default warrant  and if our financial condition deteriorates or should we fail to make timely payments on our accounts payable to wanxiang america corporation  an affiliate of vemi  or otherwise default in our supply agreement with wanxiang america corporation and fail to cure the same 
vemi could be entitled to purchase the shares underlying this warrant at a substantial discount to the current price of our common stock 
in addition  mr 
tzur and mr 
scott  our two largest individual shareholders  have granted a proxy to vemi or its designees which will give it power to vote their shares if specified events of default of occur  in some cases without exercising the default warrant 
if any of these events of default occurred  and vemi exercised all of the warrants held by it  it could acquire a significant minority percentage of our voting power  assuming exercise of the default and common stock warrants 
if vemi held this percentage of our voting power  it could control the outcome of votes on matters such as a change of control  the removal of our management  or similar matters  regardless of whether it voted its shares in the same manner as our executive officers and directors 
we could be subject to claims based on the use of asbestos brake parts have continued to evolve over the years  with substantial improvements in product formulations over time 
for example  new materials such as ceramics have been introduced into the marketplace 
in  we acquired from total brake industries a factory in walkerton  virginia  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement 
prior to the acquisition  products manufactured at the facility contained asbestos 
shortly following the acquisition  we converted our product formulation to a non asbestos formulation and since that time no products manufactured at the factory contain asbestos 
we are not aware of any claims having been made at any of our facilities related to asbestos exposure  but a risk exists that persons may seek to assert that this exposure was related to our operations  which could subject us to liability 
additionally  persons may seek to assert that our operation as a warehouse distributor prior to may have resulted in the sale of products that contained asbestos 
we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future 
we do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and anticipate that earnings  if any  will be used to finance the development and expansion of our business 
moreover  agreements with our primary and mezzanine lenders and the certificate of designations for our series a preferred stock prohibit us from paying dividends without the consent of these lenders and the holders of a majority of the series a preferred stock 
you should not expect us to pay dividends on our common stock until such time  if any  that we are able to obtain a release of these prohibitions on the payments of dividends imposed by the terms of these documents 
we do not anticipate obtaining a release on these prohibitions in the foreseeable future 
any payment of future dividends and the amounts thereof will depend upon our earnings  financial requirements  and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors  including our contractual obligations 
there are numerous outstanding warrants and conversion rights to purchase shares of our common stock  which could impair our ability to obtain additional capital on favorable terms 
venture equities management  inc s warrant to purchase  shares would become exercisable if any of several events of default specified in the warrant occur 
we have also issued warrants for various other purposes which are still outstanding 
as december   there were other warrants to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock outstanding  in addition to the other warrants referred to above 
in connection with the financing of the kelsey hayes asset acquisition we have issued significant sums of convertible debt with conversion prices tied in certain instances to our common stock market price  and with significant additional dilution possible in the event of decline in such price  such lenders also received certain warrants to purchase our common stock 
in addition  placement agents involved in the placement of such debt  as well as other investment advisors to us have been issued significant additional warrants  which if exercised could result in substantial dilution 
our ability to issue blank check preferred stock could discourage takeover attempts and  therefore  cause the price of our stock to decline 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of blank check preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors has the ability  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights which could diminish the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
we have already issued a substantial number of shares of series a and series b preferred stock 
the existing preferred stock  together with any shares of preferred stock we may issue in the future  could be utilized  under certain circumstances  as a method of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change in control 
this possible impact on takeover attempts could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
future sales of securities held by our officers  directors or the holders of our preferred stock could cause the price of our stock to decline 
the shares beneficially owned by officers and directors   shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock subject to possible increased due to anti dilution adjustment and shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants except to the extent the shares underlying the same are already registered by us are restricted securities under rule promulgated under the securities act and may not be resold except pursuant to a registration statement effective under the securities act or pursuant to an exemption from registration  including the exemption provided by rule in general  under rule as currently in effect  subject to the satisfaction of other conditions  a person who has owned restricted shares of common stock for at least one year is entitled to sell these shares subject to the volume limitations prescribed by rule shares issuable upon conversion of our series a and series b preferred stock are presently eligible for sale under rule and we have also registered the shares into which they are convertible pursuant to registration statements filed in and  therefore  may become freely tradeable  at an earlier date 
in addition  the shares issuable to the holders of our convertible debt have the right to convert the principal and interest owing under their loans into registered common stock  and the holders of warrants associated with the placement of such debt also have conversion rights into equity 
the shares held by our officers  directors and affiliates are presently eligible for sale under rule future sales of shares of common stock by our officers and directors under rule  or by the holders of the series a and b preferred stock to the extent these shares are converted into the common stock  could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the market for our stock is less active than that of many other stocks included in the nasdaq stock market  which could make it difficult to sell shares when desired 
although our stock is included in the nasdaq smallcap market  it is less actively traded than the shares of many of the other companies included in nasdaq 
the volume of trading in our stock on the nasdaq smallcap market is frequently low  which means that you may have difficulty selling the shares at a time when you desire 
we provide extensive indemnification to our officers and directors  which limits our ability to recover damages from our officers and directors and could greatly increase the costs to us in the event of shareholder litigation 
we intend to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permissible under the law 
under most circumstances  our officers and directors may not be held liable to us or our shareholders for errors in judgment or other acts or omissions in the conduct of our business unless these errors in judgment  acts or omissions constitute fraud  gross negligence or malfeasance 
this indemnification limits our ability to recover damages from our officers and directors in the event they cause us to suffer losses 
in addition  it could substantially increase our costs in the event of shareholder litigation

during  we were named  along with numerous other defendants typically  or more  in a total of lawsuits in madison county  illinois  and one lawsuit in outagamie county  wisconsin 
the lawsuits named most of the major domestic manufacturers and distributors of brake parts  among others 
the counts against us alleged negligence count i and willful and wanton conduct count ii regarding asbestos exposure over extended periods of time 
we referred these cases to experienced asbestos toxic tort counsel 
we received notice from the courts that all of these lawsuits  naming us a defendant and claiming alleged liability in connection with the sale and distribution of brake parts containing asbestos  were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiffs 
on february   we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in st 
louis county  missouri  making allegations similar to those made in the lawsuits which were dismissed 
we received notice from the court that this lawsuit  naming us as a defendant and claiming alleged liability in connection with the sale and distribution of brake parts containing asbestos  was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiff

on august   nasdaq conducted a hearing before its listing qualifications panel at which we presented information regarding of the then proposed issuance of the series a preferred stock 
the issuance of the series a preferred stock was completed on august  and nasdaq advised us that the transaction brought us back in compliance with its net tangible assets requirement 
see supplemental financial information line of credit and recent financings 
on october   nasdaq notified us that the listing qualifications panel had ruled in favor of our continued inclusion in the nasdaq stock market

diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if warrants and options or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and resulted in the issuance of additional common shares 
all options and warrants are omitted from the computation of diluted earnings per share when net losses are reported because the options and warrants are antidilutive

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our primary business is the manufacturing and marketing of brake and undercar parts  including brake rotors  brake drums  disc brake pads  brake shoes  remanufactured calipers  new clutch kits  suspension and hydraulic parts for the north american automotive aftermarket 
since the recent acquisition of certain north american assets of trw automotive s kelsey hayes company subsidiary in january  which approximately doubled our size  we have expanded our breadth of brake and undercar parts and most importantly added such well established brands such as powerstop  valumaxx and autospeciality to our recognized ultimate  evolution and ubp brands

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we believe that we do not have significant exposure to market risk associated with derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we had previously utilized only limited derivative financial instruments and did not use them for trading purposes and have never used derivative commodity instruments 
at december   there were no such derivative instruments 
the fair value of financial instruments  other then debt instruments  closely approximates their carrying value 
because the interest rate of the revolving loan and the term loan with lasalle bank national association adjusts with the changes in the market rate of interest  we believe that the fair value is equivalent to the carrying value 
we believe that the interest rate of on the subordinated debenture is approximately equal to the current rate available for similar debt 
accordingly  the fair value of this debenture approximates its carrying value
