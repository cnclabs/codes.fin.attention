table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of sunoco logistics predecessor and the financial statements of sunoco logistics partners lp among other things  those financial statements include more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following information 
introduction the partnership is a delaware limited partnership formed on october  to acquire  own  and operate  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  refined product pipelines  terminalling and storage assets  crude oil pipelines  and crude oil acquisition and marketing assets located in the northeast  midwest and south central united states 
most of these assets support sunoco r m  a wholly owned refining and marketing subsidiary of sunoco  inc general the partnership conducts its business through three segments the eastern pipeline system  the terminal facilities  and the western pipeline system 
the eastern pipeline system primarily transports refined products in the northeast and midwest united states largely for three of sunoco r m s refineries and transports crude oil in ohio and michigan 
this system also includes the interrefinery pipeline between sunoco r m s marcus hook and philadelphia refineries and ownership interests in four refined product pipeline joint ventures located in the west and midwest united states percent in explorer pipeline company explorer  percent in wolverine pipe line company wolverine  percent in west shore pipe line company west shore  and percent in yellowstone pipe line company yellowstone 
the interests in wolverine and yellowstone and a percent interest in west shore were acquired on november  for a purchase price of million 
on september   an additional percent interest in west shore was acquired for million  increasing the partnership s overall ownership interest to percent 
the terminal facilities business includes a network of refined product terminals in the northeast and midwest united states that distribute products primarily to sunoco r m s retail outlets  the nederland marine crude oil terminal on the texas gulf coast  and a liquefied petroleum gas lpg storage facility in the midwest 
the terminal facilities business also owns and operates refinery related assets  including one inland and two marine crude oil terminals and related pipelines that supply all of the crude oil processed by sunoco r m s philadelphia refinery and a refined product storage terminal used by sunoco r m s marcus hook refinery 
the western pipeline system owns and operates crude oil trunk and gathering pipelines and purchases and markets crude oil primarily in oklahoma and texas for sunoco r m s tulsa  oklahoma and toledo  ohio refineries and for other customers 
the western pipeline system also has a percent equity ownership interest in west texas gulf pipe line company west texas gulf  a joint venture that owns a crude oil pipeline in texas 
the interest in west texas gulf was acquired on november  for million 
eastern pipeline system revenues from the eastern pipeline system are generated by charging shippers tariffs for transporting refined products and crude oil through the partnership s pipelines 
the amount of revenue generated depends on the level of these tariffs and the throughput in the pipelines 
when transporting barrels  a tariff is charged based on the point of origin and the ultimate destination  even if the barrel moves through more than one pipeline segment to reach its destination 
for example  on the philadelphia  pennsylvania to buffalo  new york pipeline segment  there are separate tariffs depending on whether the ultimate destination from philadelphia is rochester  new york or buffalo  new york 
the tariffs for the partnership s interstate common carrier pipelines are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
the rate making methodology for these pipelines is price indexing 
this 
table of contents methodology provides for increases in tariff rates based upon changes in the producer price index 
competition  however  may constrain the tariffs charged 
the partnership also leases to sunoco r m  for a fixed amount escalating annually at percent  three pipelines between sunoco r m s marcus hook and philadelphia refineries  as well as a pipeline from the partnership s paulsboro terminal to the philadelphia international airport for the delivery of jet fuel 
the crude oil and refined product throughput in the eastern pipeline system s pipelines is directly affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by the pipelines 
demand for gasoline in most markets peaks during the summer driving season  which extends from april to september  and declines during the fall and winter months 
demand for heating oil and other distillate fuels tends to peak during the winter heating season  and declines during the spring and summer months 
the supply of crude oil to the eastern pipeline system depends upon the level of crude oil production in canada  which has increased in recent years 
demand for crude oil transported to refineries for processing is driven by refining margins the price of refined products compared to the price of crude oil and refining costs  unscheduled downtime at refineries and the amount of turnaround activity  which is when refiners shut down selected portions of the refinery for scheduled maintenance 
the operating income generated by the eastern pipeline system depends not only on the volume transported on its pipelines and the level of the tariff charged  but also on the fixed costs and  to a much lesser extent  the variable costs of operating the pipelines 
fixed costs are typically related to maintenance  insurance  control rooms  telecommunications  pipeline field and support personnel and depreciation 
variable costs  such as fuel and power costs to run pump stations along the pipelines  fluctuate with throughput 
terminal facilities prior to january   most of the terminalling and throughput services provided to sunoco r m were at fees that enabled the partnership to recover its costs but not generate operating income 
the partnership is now charging sunoco r m fees for these services  generally effective january   comparable to those charged in arm s length  third party transactions using the terms included in a pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement with sunoco r m entered into at the closing of the february initial public offering ipo 
under this agreement  sunoco r m pays the partnership a minimum level of revenues for terminalling refined products and crude oil and agrees to certain minimum throughputs at the inkster terminal  fort mifflin terminal complex  and marcus hook tank farm 
see agreements with sunoco r m and sunoco  inc and item certain relationships and related transactions 
under this agreement  operating income from terminalling and storage activities depends on throughput and storage volume and the level of fees charged for terminalling and storage services  as well as the fixed and variable costs of operating these facilities 
the partnership generates revenue at the nederland terminal by charging storage and throughput fees for crude oil and other petroleum products 
the operating income generated at this facility depends on storage and throughput volume and the level of fees charged for these services  as well as the fixed and variable costs of operating the terminal 
the absolute price level of crude oil and refined products does not directly affect terminalling and storage fees  although they are affected by the absolute levels of supply and demand for these products 
western pipeline system the western pipeline system consists of crude oil pipelines and gathering systems as well as the crude oil acquisition and marketing operations 
the factors affecting the operating results of the crude oil pipelines and gathering systems are substantially similar to the factors affecting the operating results of the pipelines in the eastern pipeline system described above 
the operating results of the crude oil acquisition and marketing operations are dependent on its ability to 
table of contents sell crude oil at a price in excess of the aggregate cost 
management of the partnership believes gross margin  which is equal to sales and other operating revenue less cost of products sold and operating expenses and depreciation and amortization  is a key measure of financial performance for the western pipeline system 
the crude oil acquisition and marketing operations generate substantial revenue and cost of products sold because they reflect the sales price and cost of the significant volume of crude oil bought and sold 
however  the absolute price levels for crude oil normally do not bear a relationship to gross margin  although these price levels significantly impact revenue and cost of products sold 
as a result  period to period variations in revenue and cost of products sold are not generally meaningful in analyzing the variation in gross margin for the crude oil acquisition and marketing operations 
in general  crude oil is purchased at the wellhead from local producers and in bulk at major pipeline connection and marketing points 
the partnership also enters into transactions with third parties in which one grade of crude oil is exchanged for another grade that more nearly matches the delivery requirement or the preferences of customers 
bulk purchases and sales and exchange transactions are characterized by large volume and much smaller margins than are sales of crude oil purchased at the wellhead 
as crude oil is purchased  the partnership establishes a margin by selling or exchanging the crude oil for physical delivery of other crude oil to sunoco r m and third party customers  such as independent refiners or major oil companies  thereby reducing exposure to price fluctuations 
this margin is determined by the difference between the price of crude oil at the point of purchase and the price of crude oil at the point of sale  minus the associated costs related to acquisition and transportation 
changes in the absolute price level for crude oil do not materially impact the margin  as attempts are made to maintain positions that are substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and sales 
because attempts are made to maintain balanced positions  the partnership is able to minimize basis risk  which occurs when crude oil is purchased based on a crude oil specification that is different from the countervailing sales arrangement 
specification differences include grades or types of crude oil  variability in lease crude oil barrels produced  individual refinery demand for specific grades of crude oil  relative market prices for the different grades of crude oil  customer location  availability of transportation facilities  timing  and costs including storage involved in delivering crude oil to the customer 
the partnership s policy is only to purchase crude oil for which there is a market and to structure the sales contracts so that crude oil price fluctuations do not materially affect the margin received 
the partnership does not acquire and hold any futures contracts or other derivative products for any purpose 
the partnership operates the crude oil acquisition and marketing activities differently as market conditions change 
during periods when there is a higher demand than supply of crude oil in the near term  the market is in backwardation  meaning that the price of crude oil in a given month exceeds the price of crude oil for delivery in subsequent months 
a backwardated market has a positive impact on marketing margins because crude oil marketers can continue to purchase crude oil from producers at a fixed premium to posted prices while selling crude oil at a higher premium to such prices 
in backwardated markets  crude oil is purchased and contracted for its sale as soon as possible 
when the demand for crude oil is weak  the market for crude oil is often in contango  meaning that the price of crude oil in a given month is less than the price of crude oil for delivery in subsequent months 
in a contango market  marketing margins are adversely impacted  as crude oil marketers are unable to capture the premium to posted prices described above 
however  this unfavorable market condition can be mitigated by storing crude oil because storage owners at major trading locations can simultaneously purchase production at current prices for storage and sell at higher prices for future delivery 
as a result  in a contango market  crude oil will be purchased and contracted for its delivery in future months to capture the price difference 

table of contents agreements with sunoco r m and sunoco  inc upon the closing of the february ipo  the partnership entered into the following agreements pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement under this agreement  sunoco r m is paying the partnership fees generally comparable to those charged by third parties to transport on the refined product pipelines or throughput in the inland refined product terminals an amount of refined products that will produce at least million of revenue for the contract year from march  to february   escalating at percent each march for the next three contract years 
in addition  sunoco r m will pay the partnership to transport on the refined product pipelines or throughput in the refined product terminals an amount of refined products that will produce at least million of revenue in the contract year commencing march   and at least million of revenue in the contract year commencing march  sunoco r m will pay the published tariffs on the pipelines and contractually agreed upon fees at the terminals 
based upon the prorated minimum amount noted  sunoco r m has exceeded the minimum revenue amount through december  and management of the partnership expects sunoco r m to exceed the minimum amount under the agreement for the contract year from march  through february   receive and deliver at least  bpd of refined products per year at the marcus hook tank farm for five years 
this throughput is an annual amount for the contract period from march to february for the term of the agreement 
for the calendar year ended december   the partnership received a fee of per barrel for the first  bpd and per barrel for volume in excess of  bpd 
these fees escalate at the rate of percent each january for the term of the agreement 
based upon the prorated minimum throughput amount noted  sunoco r m has exceeded the minimum throughput amount through december  and management of the partnership expects sunoco r m to exceed the minimum throughput amount under the agreement for the contract year from march  through february   store  barrels of lpg per contract year at the inkster terminal  which represents all of the lpg storage capacity at this facility 
this storage is an annual amount for the contract period from april to march for the seven year term of the agreement 
for the calendar year ended december   the partnership received a fee of per barrel of committed storage  a fee of per barrel for receipts greater than  barrels per contract year and a fee of per barrel for deliveries greater than  barrels per contract year 
these fees will escalate at the rate of percent each january for the term of the agreement 
based upon the prorated minimum storage amount noted  sunoco r m has exceeded the minimum storage amount through december  and management of the partnership expects sunoco r m to exceed the minimum storage amount under the agreement for the contract year from april  through march   receive and deliver at least  bpd of crude oil or refined products per contract year at the fort mifflin terminal complex for seven years 
this throughput is an annual amount for the contract period from march to february for the term of the agreement 
for the year ended december   the partnership received a fee of per barrel for the first  bpd and per barrel for volume in excess of  bpd 
these fees will escalate at the rate of percent each january for the term of the agreement 
based upon the prorated minimum throughput amount noted  sunoco r m has exceeded the minimum throughput amount through december  and management of the partnership expects sunoco r m to exceed the minimum throughput amount under the agreement for the contract year from march  through february   and transport or cause to be transported an aggregate of at least  bpd of crude oil per contract year on the marysville to toledo  nederland to longview  cushing to tulsa  barnsdall to tulsa  and bad creek to tulsa crude oil pipelines at the published tariffs for a term of seven years 
this throughput is an 
table of contents annual amount for the contract period from march to february for the term of the agreement 
based upon the prorated minimum throughput amount noted  sunoco r m has exceeded the minimum throughput amount through december  and management of the partnership expects sunoco r m to exceed the minimum throughput amount under the agreement for the contract year from march  through february  if sunoco r m fails to meet its minimum obligations pursuant to the contract terms set forth above  it will be required to pay in cash the amount of any shortfall  which may be applied as a credit in the following year after sunoco r m s minimum obligations for that year are met 
sunoco r m s obligations under this agreement may be permanently reduced or suspended if sunoco r m shuts down or reconfigures one of its refineries other than planned maintenance turnarounds  or is prohibited from using mtbe in the gasoline it produces  and reasonably believes in good faith that such event will jeopardize its ability to satisfy these obligations 
although new york and connecticut began enforcing state imposed mtbe bans on january   this has not currently affected sunoco r m s obligations under the agreement 
from time to time  sunoco  inc may be presented with opportunities by third parties with respect to its refinery assets 
these opportunities may include offers to purchase and joint venture propositions 
sunoco  inc is also continually considering changes to its refineries 
those changes may involve new facilities  reduction in certain operations or modifications of facilities or operations 
changes may be considered to meet market demands  to satisfy regulatory requirements or environmental and safety objectives  to improve operational efficiency or for other reasons 
sunoco  inc has advised the partnership that although it continually considers the types of matters referred to above  it is not currently proceeding with any transaction or plan that it believes will likely result in any reconfigurations or other operational changes in any of its refineries served by the partnership s assets that would have a material effect on sunoco r m s business relationship with the partnership 
further  sunoco  inc has also advised the management of the partnership that it is not considering a shutdown of any of its refineries served by the partnership s assets 
sunoco  inc is  however  actively managing its assets and operations and  therefore  changes of some nature  possibly material to its business relationship with the partnership  are likely to occur at some point in the future 
to the extent sunoco r m does not extend or renew the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement  the partnership s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the partnership s assets were constructed or purchased to service sunoco r m s refining and marketing supply chain and are well situated to suit sunoco r m s needs 
as a result  management of the partnership would expect that even if this agreement is not renewed  sunoco r m would continue to use the pipelines and terminals 
however  management cannot assure investors and other interested parties that sunoco r m will continue to use the partnership s facilities or that additional revenues can be generated from third parties 
omnibus agreement historically  sunoco has allocated a portion of its general and administrative expenses to its pipeline  terminalling  and storage operations to cover costs of centralized corporate functions such as legal  accounting  treasury  engineering  information technology  insurance and other corporate services 
prior to the ipo  such expenses were based on amounts negotiated between the parties  which approximated sunoco s cost of providing such services 
under the omnibus agreement entered into with sunoco concurrent with the ipo  sunoco provides these centralized corporate functions for three years for an annual administrative fee  which may be increased annually by the lesser of percent or the consumer price index for the applicable year 
the fee for the annual period ended december  was million 
these costs may also increase if the partnership consummates an acquisition or constructs additional assets that require an increase in the level of general and administrative services received by the partnership from the general partner or sunoco 
the annual fee includes costs incurred by sunoco to perform the centralized corporate functions described above 
this fee does not 
table of contents include the costs of shared insurance programs  which are allocated to the partnership based upon its share of the premiums incurred 
this fee also does not include salaries of pipeline and terminal personnel or other employees of the general partner  including senior executives  or the cost of their employee benefits

the partnership also began incurring additional general and administrative costs from the date of the ipo  including costs for tax return preparation  annual and quarterly reports to unitholders  investor relations  registrar and transfer agent fees  and other costs related to operating as a separate publicly held entity 
the omnibus agreement also requires sunoco r m to reimburse the partnership for any operating expenses and capital expenditures in excess of million per year in each calendar year from to that are made to comply with the dot s pipeline integrity management rule  subject to a maximum aggregate reimbursement of million over the five year period ending december   complete  at its expense  certain tank maintenance and inspection projects at the darby creek tank farm  and reimburse the partnership for up to million of expenditures required at the marcus hook tank farm and the darby creek tank farm to maintain compliance with existing industry standards and regulatory requirements 
for the years ended december  and  the partnership was reimbursed million and million  respectively  by sunoco r m for maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses incurred in excess of million to comply with the dot s pipeline integrity management rule 
at december   the partnership has received a cumulative reimbursement of million in regard to the million maximum reimbursement over the five year period for compliance expenditures related to the dot s pipeline integrity management rule 
for the year ended december   the partnership was also reimbursed million by sunoco r m for certain tank maintenance and inspection capital expenditures at the darby creek tank farm 
there were no amounts expended for these tank maintenance and inspection projects at the darby creek tank farm during for the years ended december  and  the partnership was reimbursed by sunoco r m for expenditures at the marcus hook tank farm and the darby creek tank farm to maintain compliance with existing industry standards and regulatory requirements

year ended december  versus year ended december  analysis of statements of income net income was million for the year ended december  as compared with million for the prior year  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in operating income and a million decrease in income tax expense  partially offset by a million increase in net interest expense 
the increase in operating income was principally due to the effect of special items such as the absence in the current year of a million write down of an idled refined product pipeline at the eastern pipeline system and a related terminal and a million gain in the current year relating to the settlement of a claim at the nederland terminal resulting from assets damaged by the may third party natural gas pipeline release 
the cash received relating to this claim was primarily used to replace or repair damaged assets 
the increase in operating income also includes equity income for a full year from the corporate joint ventures acquired in november  higher trunk and gathering pipeline volumes and an increase in gross margins at the western pipeline system  and a decline in operating expenses at the eastern pipeline system 
partially offsetting these items were increases in selling  general and administrative expenses and operating expenses at the western pipeline system and terminal facilities 
sales and other operating revenue totaled  million for the year ended december  as compared with  million for the prior year  an increase of million 
this increase was largely attributable to an increase in crude oil prices and higher lease acquisition and bulk volumes
