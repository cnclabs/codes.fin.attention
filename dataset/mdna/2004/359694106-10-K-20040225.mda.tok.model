item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the operating environment was characterized by increases in raw material costs  an elusive economic recovery  and heavy competition for volume  resulting in average selling price decreases and gross margin erosion as compared to sales volume decreased in as compared to mainly due to the sluggish economic conditions 
imbedded in the sales volume reduction however  was growth in our asia pacific and latin american regions 
although on a sales volume basis  these regions are a small percentage of total net revenue  they do represent excellent growth opportunities over the longer term 
during the company did complete the restructuring initiative that began in the first quarter of net pretax charges of million related to the restructuring initiative were recorded in as compared to million recorded in when reviewing the company s operating results it is important to understand how key external factors impact the company s financial results 
these factors include  
economic growth rates  especially in north america and europe  
the price changes of crude oil and natural gas  and 
currency exchange rates in  the company generated percent of its revenue in north america and percent in europe 
the pace of economic growth in these regions has a direct impact on the revenues of certain business units in the company 
within the global adhesives operating segment  the revenues of the assembly  converting and automotive business units are especially sensitive to the economic growth rates 
customers of the assembly business include manufacturers of furniture  appliances and other durable goods that are sensitive to the fluctuations in economic activity 
the converting business unit generates its revenue from companies that produce packaging materials such as corrugated boxes  which are in lower demand as economic activity slows down 
other business units within global adhesives that are not as susceptible to fluctuations in economic growth are the nonwoven and packaging business units 
nonwoven customers are primarily manufacturers of personal hygiene products and the packaging business unit generates a high percentage of its revenue from the food industry 
in the full valu specialty operating segment the powder coatings business  which sells to manufacturers of appliances  office equipment  lawn and garden equipment and other products made with metals is the most sensitive to overall economic growth rates 
the windows business unit and ceramic tile installation product line  both within the full valu specialty segment  are sensitive to more specific economic indicators such as housing starts in the us price changes of crude oil and natural gas have a direct impact on the raw material costs of the company 
many of our raw materials are petroleum based derivatives and are therefore subject to the fluctuations in the commodity prices 
although the company made progress in lowering raw material costs in as compared to through its strategic sourcing teams  increases in energy prices during offset the benefits achieved 
the movement of foreign currency exchange rates impacts the translation of the foreign entities financial statements into us dollars 
in  due primarily to the significant strengthening of the euro against the us dollar  currency rate changes increased the company s net revenue by percent  or nearly million as compared to the strengthening of other currencies against the us dollar such as the japanese yen  australian dollar  british pound and canadian dollar also contributed to the net revenue increase in as an example of the foreign currency movement  at november   the euro was equal to and at november  the euro was equal to 
the stronger foreign currencies also caused us dollar increases in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million 
the resulting increase in net income before income taxes of million translates into an estimated increase in earnings per share of 
in contrast  the strengthening euro was also one of the reasons for the slow economy in europe 
the strong euro makes it more expensive for companies outside europe to purchase european products  resulting in decreases in european exports 
in looking forward to we will again be faced with raw material pressures  at least in the early stages of the year  due to the price increases in crude oil and natural gas 
during the fourth quarter of there were signs of economic recovery  especially in the us the restructuring initiative has left the company s cost structures in a relatively improved position to leverage the sales growth that will come with economic recovery 
new initiatives  such as lean six sigma sm  are being deployed to generate growth opportunities and to further improve the company s operating processes 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates management s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us the company sponsors other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on management s assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets  projected salary increases and healthcare cost trend rates 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is august note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these assumptions for both the non us and non us plans 
the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate in the us was percent at august  as compared to percent at august  and percent at august  a discount rate reduction of percentage points increases pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately million 
discount rates for the company s non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the non us plan 
the expected return on assets assumption on the investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change annually 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the future rate of return 
the current investment mix in the portfolios is nearly percent in us equities 
from through  the company used an expected return on asset assumption for the us portfolio of percent 
at august   given the poor performance of the us equity markets in and  management lowered the expected rate of return assumption to percent 
this rate was used in calculating the expenses for and will also be used for a change of percentage points for the expected return assumption will impact net pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately million 
expected return on asset assumptions for the company s non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  management has used the rate of percent for the past three years 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
as of november   the company s balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill 
the goodwill is primarily included in the global adhesives operating segment 
on december   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the new accounting standard for goodwill 
this standard requires that goodwill is no longer amortized on a recurring basis 
instead  the goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
sfas no 
requires that the company  on an annual basis  calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
the standard also required that  upon adoption  the company make an initial impairment calculation 
both the initial calculation and the subsequent calculations confirmed that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values by significant margins 
management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
the calculation uses a discounted cash flow analysis that requires management to project financial performance and related cash flows 
the projections are based on management s best estimate given recent financial performance  market trends  strategic plans and other available information 
future results will most likely differ from the projected results 
however  based on the margin that fair value exceeded carrying value of the various reporting units  management does not anticipate a material impact on the company s financial results from differences in these assumptions 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as disclosed in item and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various claims  lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these matters are made when it is determined that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential amount exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted  as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the gross amount of the estimated liabilities  is accrued and a receivable is recorded for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
in the eifs litigation involving single family homes referred to in note  million for the potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries were accrued 
as of november   the company had reserved an additional million for all other pending matters 
also as of november  the company has recorded million for insurance receivables on all other pending litigation and previously settled matters 
this amount of insurance recoveries includes million due from insurers for settlement of asbestos related claims settled during the gross amount of all such settlements was expensed during the fiscal year 
based upon currently available facts  management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of any pending legal proceeding  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  adverse developments could negatively impact earnings or cash flows in a particular future period 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at november   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million 
results of operations compared to and net revenue net revenue in of  million was million or percent more than the net revenue recorded in the net revenue in of  million was percent less than the  million recorded in the percent increase in consisted of a decrease in volume of percent  a decrease in selling prices of percent and a percent increase due to the currency exchange effects of a weaker us dollar 
the exchange effects were caused primarily by the weakness of the us dollar as compared to the euro 
the company s european net revenue included a percent increase from currency effects 
a contributing factor in the percent revenue volume decrease in as compared to was the relatively low economic growth realized in europe and north america in the slow economies also contributed to the decrease in average selling prices of percent by causing many adhesive manufacturers to bid for volume at significantly lower prices 
by operating segment  global adhesives net revenue increased percent as compared to  driven by a positive percent currency impact 
the full valu specialty segment realized a net revenue increase of percent in as compared to the percent decrease in net revenue in as compared to consisted of a decrease in volume of percent  a decrease in selling prices of percent and an increase due to currency effects of percent 
the decrease as compared to was consistent across the company s operating segments as both the global adhesives segment and the full valu specialty segment reported net revenue decreases of percent 
there were no significant net revenue increases or decreases attributed to acquisitions or divestitures in as compared to  or in as compared to cost of sales the cost of sales in of million was million or percent more than the cost of sales of million in the cost of sales was million 
as a percent of net revenue the cost of sales was percent as compared to percent in and percent in the cost of sales included approximately million of increased costs  as compared to  due to the currency exchange effects of the weakened us dollar  primarily as compared to the euro 
the cost of sales also included million  or percent of net revenue  of costs related to the company s restructuring initiative and the cost of sales included million  or percent of net revenue  of costs related to the same restructuring initiative 
cost of sales savings resulting from the restructuring initiative were an estimated million in as compared to raw material costs increased in as compared to primarily due to increases in energy prices 
major raw materials used in the company s production processes include vinyl acetate monomer  vinyl acetate emulsions and other petroleum based derivatives whose prices fluctuate with the price changes in energy commodities such as crude oil and natural gas 
raw material costs decreased in as compared to selling  general and administrative sg a expenses sg a expenses were million in  million in and million in sg a expenses related to the company s restructuring initiative were million in and million in sg a expense savings realized in as compared to resulting from the restructuring initiative were an estimated million 
the currency effects of the weaker us dollar added approximately million to the sg a expenses as compared to costs related to the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans added million to the expenses in as compared to this followed an increase in as compared to of million 
this increase of nearly million in two years resulted primarily from the us benefit plans 
these cost increases were caused mainly by the poor performance of the benefit plan asset portfolios in  and lower interest rates also contributed to the higher expenses of the benefit plans because the benefit plan obligations increase when there is a decrease in the interest rates used to discount the plan liabilities 
management incentive compensation expenses in were million less than approximately million of that decrease was included in sg a expenses with the remaining million included in cost of sales 
management incentives depend substantially upon the company s financial performance compared to targets set at the beginning of the year 
in  the financial results achieved compared to the targets were worse than the comparable performance of  resulting in the significant reduction in management incentive expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses of million in as compared to was driven by the restructuring related costs of million  the increase in pension and other postretirement costs of million and an increase in the management incentive compensation of approximately million 
these expense increases in were mitigated by expense reductions resulting from spending controls and reduced employee census 
interest expense interest expense was million in as compared to million in and million in lower average outstanding debt levels were the main reason for the reduced interest expense in as compared to and relatively lower interest rates also contributed to the reduced interest expense but not to the magnitude of the reduced average debt levels 
positive operating cash flow allowed the company to pay down debt levels in  and gains from sales of assets gains from sales of assets were million in as compared to million in and million in of the million in gains recorded in  million was related to the sale of a facility in north america that was closed as part of the restructuring initiative 
in  million of the million in gains related to facilities that were closed as part of the restructuring 
the gains also included a gain of million from the sale of an office building in latin america 
other expense  net other expense  net was million in  million in and million in the increase of million in as compared to was primarily the result of foreign currency transaction losses 
these foreign currency losses were million in as compared to million in of the million of foreign currency losses incurred in  million was incurred in the first quarter 
the first quarter losses were mainly due to the british pound sterling weakening against the euro 
in the united kingdom  although we designated the euro as our functional currency  many transactions are still denominated in pound sterling 
this exposure to the rate of exchange between the pound sterling and the euro combined with a significant weakening of the pound sterling against the euro during the first quarter resulted in the first quarter losses in appropriate hedging strategies were implemented late in the first quarter in an effort to mitigate the impact of future fluctuations 
the remaining million of foreign currency losses in and the million in were primarily due to the devaluation of currencies in latin america  which operate on a us dollar functional currency 
the adoption of sfas no 
in  which resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization expense was the main reason for the lower other expense in as compared to the other expense in included million of goodwill amortization expense 
the significant components of other expense  net are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in in  a million per share tax credit associated with the liquidation of an inactive european legal entity  reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points 
also included in the income tax expense was million of tax savings associated with the net pretax restructuring charges of million  which increased the effective income tax rates percentage points 
in  the impact of the restructuring initiative lowered the effective income tax rate percentage points 
the income tax expense included a one time tax benefit of million per share related to changes in the company s business structure in europe 
minority interests expense income minority interests was income of million in as compared to expense of million in and million in the income in as compared to expense in was a direct result of reduced pretax earnings in our north american automotive business  of which we own percent 
included in the minority interest expense was a million credit related to million of restructuring charges included in the pretax earnings of the automotive joint venture 
income from equity investments income from equity investments was million in  million in and million in this income is related to our percent ownership in an automotive joint venture with a european company 
pretax earnings of the european company increased in as compared to  resulting in the increased income from equity investments 
net income net income in was million as compared to million in and million in net charges related to the restructuring plan reduced net income by million in  million in and million in the net income included an after tax charge of million per share related to the company s adoption of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition 
the charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the income per diluted share was  and in  and  respectively 
operating segment results compared to and note management evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income which is defined as gross profit less sg a expenses and excluding the gains on the sales of assets 
charges  net of gains on the sales of assets in connection with the company s restructuring initiatives are excluded from its operating segment results  consistent with internal management reporting 
corporate expenses are fully allocated to the operating segments 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
global adhesives net revenue of million in was percent more than net revenue of million in the currency effects from a weaker us dollar  primarily in comparison to the euro  resulted in a net revenue increase of percent in as compared to the european adhesives revenue alone was impacted by a positive percent in due to currency effects 
sales volume in global adhesives decreased percent in reflecting the slow economies of europe and north america 
volume growth however was realized in in both the latin america and asia pacific regions of global adhesives 
selling prices decreased percent in as compared to with the economies in north america and europe slow to recover  the adhesives market in was characterized by fierce competition for volume  resulting in lower average selling prices 
the net revenue in of million was percent less than the net revenue of million in the currency effects were positive percent on the net revenue as compared to the weakening of the us dollar began in the second half of and continued throughout sales volume decreased percent and average selling prices decreased percent in as compared to the market conditions in were similar to with slow economic activity in our largest geographic markets  ie north america and europe  resulting in a highly competitive marketplace focused mainly on reduced selling prices 
operating income in the global adhesives segment was million in as compared to million in and million in as a percentage of net revenue the operating income was percent in as compared to percent in and percent in a significant reason for the reduced operating income in as compared to was the results of our north american automotive business 
operating income in this market decreased nearly million in as compared to primarily due to the increase in raw material costs  especially plasticizers and resins  combined with not being able to increase our selling prices to the automotive customers 
the overall gross profit margin in the global adhesives segment decreased percentage points in as compared to each of the reporting units within global adhesives recorded gross profit margin decreases in mainly due to the increase in raw material costs 
sg a expenses in global adhesives increased million or percent in as compared to currency effects accounted for nearly million of the increase 
sg a expenses also increased due to the increase in pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs 
the reduction in management incentive plan costs was the most significant decrease realized in the sg a expenses as compared to the increase in operating income of million in as compared to was primarily the result of a percentage point increase in the gross profit margin 
in  raw material prices decreased in comparison to sg a expenses increased approximately million or percent in as compared to due mainly to the expense increases associated with the pension and other postretirement plans 
full valu specialty net revenue of million in was percent more than the million of net revenue in currency effects were a positive percent in as compared to in the full valu specialty segment  the currency effects resulted primarily from the weakening us dollar against the australian dollar and british pound sterling 
this segment has very little euro denominated revenue 
average selling prices decreased percent in as compared to while sales volume increased percent 
sales to the consumer market in australia grew in as did the sales to the window market in north america 
the window market continued to benefit from the strong us housing industry 
another area of revenue growth in the full valu specialty segment was in the adalis product line  which consists of specialty hot melt products used in packaging applications 
net revenue from the powder coatings products decreased in as compared to contributing to the powder coatings revenue decrease was the overall slow economy in north america as well as a shift of powder coatings applicators moving their existing production facilities to lower cost countries  such as china 
we currently do not have a presence in china in the powder coatings market 
the net revenue in of million was percent less than the net revenue in of million 
revenue decreases in the powder coatings market were partially offset by increases in the ceramic tile setting materials and windows markets 
operating income in the full valu specialty segment was million in  million in and million in as a percent of net revenue  operating income was percent in  percent in and percent in the gross profit margin in the full valu specialty segment has been steady over the three year reporting period with percent in  percent in and percent in similar to the global adhesives segment  sg a expense increases due to pension and other postretirement plan cost increases were partially offset by reduced management incentive compensation costs 
also impacting sg a expenses in as compared to were increased product liability costs of million related to the exterior insulated finish systems product line 
the decrease in operating income from million in to million in was driven primarily by reductions in the profitability of the powder coatings market in north america and the liquid paints market in latin america 
the ceramic tile installation and hvac insulation product lines both had increases in profitability in as compared to restructuring and other related costs during  net pretax charges of million million after tax and minority interests were recorded in connection with the restructuring plan announced on january  the plan  which was contemplated in  approved and implemented throughout  was completed in as a result approximately percent of the company s global manufacturing capacity was eliminated 
twelve manufacturing facilities were closed in the global adhesives operating segment eight in north america  three in latin america and one in europe 
in the full valu specialty operating segment  two manufacturing facilities were closed one in the united states and one in latin america and one production line was shut down in another facility in the united states 
in connection with the restructuring plan  the company also upgraded and realigned its global adhesives sales force 
by reducing capacity and eliminating other cost structures  consisting primarily of reduced employee related costs and reduced depreciation expenses  operating costs were reduced at least million in the savings increased from the million previously estimated primarily due to sg a expense savings exceeding the original estimates 
the plan resulted in the elimination of positions 
of the total reductions  occurred in the global adhesives operating segment  in the full valu specialty operating segment and in corporate 
offsetting the reduction was newly hired employees  primarily in manufacturing facilities that assumed additional volume previously produced by facilities that were closed as part of the restructuring plan and sales related positions as part of the upgrading and realignment of the sales force 
since inception of the plan  the company has recorded total pretax charges of million 
these charges were offset by million of gains on sales of assets impacted by the restructuring plan 
additional sales of assets subject to the plan are expected to yield gains that will bring the total net pretax charges down to approximately million 
these assets  currently recorded as assets held for sale  consist of three facilities with a combined net book value of million 
the charges related to the plan included employee separation costs  accelerated depreciation on assets held and used until disposal  lease contract termination costs and other costs directly related to the restructuring plan 
cash costs of the plan  net of proceeds from sales of assets subject to the plan are expected to be approximately million 
as of november  cash costs incurred were million offset by million of proceeds from sales of assets subject to the plan 
the remaining restructuring liability as of november  was million

the million in cost of sales consisted of million of employee severance and benefits  million of accelerated depreciation and million of other costs directly attributed to the restructuring plan 
the other costs are primarily period costs associated with the closure of manufacturing facilities such as equipment tear down and decommissioning expenses  facility maintenance and clean up costs  equipment and inventory relocation and employee relocation expenditures 
the million in sg a expenses consisted of million of employee severance and benefits  million of accelerated depreciation  million reduction to adverse lease accruals and million of other costs directly attributed to the restructuring plan 
the million gain on sales of assets relates to the sale of an adhesives manufacturing facility that was closed as part of the restructuring initiative 
of the total net pretax charges of million incurred in  million was attributed to the global adhesives operating segment and million to the full valu specialty operating segment 
the gains on sales of assets were attributed to the global adhesives operating segment 
non cash charges attributed to employee severance and benefits are related to granting of accelerated vesting on restricted stock held by certain employees subject to the restructuring and to net losses resulting from curtailment and other special termination benefits associated with the u 
s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the long term portion of the restructuring liability relates to adverse lease commitments that are expected to be paid beyond one year 
the beginning balance of million in the restructuring liability relates to a prior restructuring plan 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities net cash provided from operating activities was million in  million in and million in a significant factor in the decrease of million in cash provided from operating activities in as compared to was management s decision in the third quarter of to contribute million to the us pension plan 
this funding increased the us pension plan assets to a level that exceeded the plan s accumulated benefit obligation at the annual measurement date of august  partially offsetting this contribution was the liquidation of an investment held in us treasury bills of approximately million 
it is not expected that the company will make additional contributions to the us pension plan in cash required in related to the company s restructuring initiative was million as compared to million in management incentive compensation payments in  related to the company s financial results of  were million more than the payments related to the financial results of operating working capital  defined as current assets less cash minus current liabilities less short term debt  was million at november   as compared to million at november  and million at december  the increase in operating working capital of million in as compared to was driven by increases in accounts receivable  decreases in accrued compensation liabilities associated with management incentives and decreases in the restructuring liabilities 
the weakened us dollar against major foreign currencies in resulted in an increase in operating working capital of approximately million 
as a percentage of annualized net revenue fourth quarter net revenue multiplied by  operating working capital was percent  percent and percent at the end of fiscal years  and  respectively 
trade accounts receivable days sales outstanding was days at november  as compared to days at november  and days at december  inventory days on hand  which is calculated using a rolling five quarter average of inventory dollars  was days at the end of each of the fiscal years  and cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures were million in as compared to million in and million in nearly percent of the capital expenditures in were related to information technology projects 
of the remaining percent  the largest percentage was spent on process improvement projects in our manufacturing facilities 
capital expenditures in are again expected to be in the range of million 
two other items included in the investing activities in were the purchase of certain assets of an adhesive company in the us for million and a million investment for a minimal ownership percentage of a technology company 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to million in and million in the million in was used primarily for a net reduction of notes payable of million and common stock dividend payments of million 
the cash used in financing activities was less in by approximately million as compared to both and one reason for this was that cash provided from operating activities was used to reduce long term debt in and in we did not reduce long term debt significantly because the remaining outstanding long term debt has prohibitive prepayment penalties associated with it 
this was also a factor in management s decision to contribute million to the us pension plan in the company s debt to equity ratio  defined as long term debt divided by long term debt plus stockholders equity  was percent at november   percent at november  and percent at december  there are no contractual or regulatory restrictions on the ability of consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends  loans or advances to the company  except for typical statutory restrictions  which prohibit distributions in excess of net capital or similar tests 
currently the company does not believe these restrictions will impact its ability to meet its obligations 
in december   the company registered with the securities and exchange commission to issue  at an indeterminate date  debt and equity securities with an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed million

competition a wide variety of products are sold in numerous markets  each of which is highly competitive 
the company s competitive position in the markets in which it participates is  in part  subject to external factors

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk exposure to changes in interest rates result primarily from borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
management believes that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on the results of operations of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of its variable rate debt as of november  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial position 
approximately percent of net revenue is generated outside of the united states 
principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  argentine peso and brazilian real 
management s objective is to balance  where possible  local currency denominated assets to local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
management takes steps to minimize risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
during  additional processes were implemented in an effort to further minimize foreign exchange exposure 
management does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
note and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional details regarding the management of foreign exchange risk 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results  a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change of approximately per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  synthetic rubbers  vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers 
the company generally avoids sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate sources for most key raw materials are available  if worldwide supplies were disrupted due to unforeseen events  or if unusual demand causes products to be subject to allocation  shortages could occur 
in  the single largest expenditure was the purchase of raw materials 
management acknowledges that in the long term  prices of most raw materials will probably increase 
management s objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both its quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts that limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible is used to minimize the impact of possible price increases
