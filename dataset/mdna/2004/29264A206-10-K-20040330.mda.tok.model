table of contents part i item business we design  manufacture and market rf radio frequency subsystems that enable the transmission  reception and processing of high speed electromagnetic signals in broadband wireless telecommunications systems  cellular telephone infrastructure networks  defense electronics systems and other similar systems requiring rf  microwave and millimeter wave technology 
we were originally incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in in march  we merged with trw milliwave inc trw milliwave  a rf subsystem supplier that was a wholly owned subsidiary of trw inc  now owned by northrop grumman space mission systems corp 
northrop grumman 
in connection with the merger  we changed our name from endgate corporation to endwave corporation 
as a result of the merger  we became one of our industry s largest commercial suppliers of microwave and millimeter wave rf subsystems with a substantially increased customer base and design and manufacturing capacity 
on october   we successfully completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
the largest use of our products is in current and next generation cellular backhaul networks  carrier class trunking networks  point to point transmission networks  and point to multipoint access networks 
our target customers for these applications are microwave radio manufacturers and wireless systems integrators collectively referred to as oems that provide the wireless equipment used by communications service providers to deliver voice  data and video services to businesses and consumers 
we also supply products to cellular base station subsystem manufacturers 
original equipment manufacturers oems that use or have used our products include allgon microwave  ceragon  ericsson  harris corporation  hughes network systems  nera networks  nokia  nortel networks  p com  powerwave  siemens ag  spectrian  stratex networks and witcom wireless 
in addition to these telecommunications applications  our products are also used in various other adjacent market applications 
our target customers in these markets are defense contractors and sub contractors that design aerospace  defense weapons  and electronics platforms for various domestic and foreign defense customers 
we also supply manufacturers of test and measurement equipment  surveillance equipment and of various other electronic products for commercial and government applications 
adjacent market customers that use or have used our products include anritsu  boeing corporation  filtronic  harris corporation  idt  l communications  lockheed martin  m a com tyco  raytheon  safeview and various business units of northrop grumman 
we design our products to best satisfy our customers technical  inventory  logistical  and cost requirements by using our proprietary technologies  rf design  and manufacturing expertise 
we offer a broad range of products at multiple levels of integration that are optimized for a customer s specific product and performance needs 
our products include rf modules such as power amplifiers  low noise amplifiers  up and down converters  frequency multipliers  oscillators  synthesizers  integrated transceivers  and power amplifier switch combiners used in cellular base stations 
our proprietary circuit and manufacturing technologies enable us to design and manufacture rf subsystems that minimize the use of expensive gallium arsenide and reduce manual labor 
we use third party semiconductor fabrication facilities for the manufacturing of the gallium arsenide and other semiconductor devices  which we design 
designing our own semiconductor devices gives us the flexibility to use technologies best suited for specific applications and eliminates dependence on and limitations of standard  commercially available gallium arsenide devices 
we believe our proprietary technologies and processes give us a significant competitive advantage in manufacturing our products in high volume with a path to low per unit cost 
we also offer build to print btp manufacturing services for customer designed products such as multi function modules  transceivers and other key components of outdoor units odus 
btp services enable us to capture new manufacturing volume for customer programs that require no design efforts on the part of endwave 
although btp business does not fully utilize all of endwave s expertise  particularly rf design  it does allow us to serve the needs of larger customers that have exceeded their internal manufacturing capacities  want to move to an outsourced manufacturing model  or have the need to 
table of contents change suppliers due to product sourcing difficulties or other business reasons  including the departure of other merchant suppliers 
btp manufacturing opportunities also allow endwave to capture manufacturing volume and associated revenues without expending the substantial engineering investments typically associated with rf product design effort 
further  it builds our relationship with the customer enhancing our opportunities for additional business 
during the telecommunications market downturn that began in late  endwave initiated a mergers and acquisitions strategy designed to achieve revenue growth and gain market share 
as part of our strategy  endwave has made selected acquisitions of businesses in related or competitive markets 
endwave has completed the following asset acquisitions during the past months acquired assets acquired from timeframe stellex broadband wireless business m a com tyco april signal technology s wireless group signal technology september arcom wireless dover corporation february verticom wireless verticom may in april we completed the acquisition of certain assets from tyco electronics related to their m a com broadband wireless business 
the assets acquired included product designs and intellectual property  inventory  equipment and customer contracts for yig oscillators  frequency synthesizers and microwave radio transceivers 
in september we acquired the broadband assets of the fixed wireless division of signal technology corporation 
the acquisition included assets such as customer contracts  equipment  inventory  product designs and other intellectual property  and key personnel needed for the ongoing operation of the business unit 
the acquisition added a broad product offering and capability to the endwave product and technology portfolio 
the acquisition both expanded relationships with existing customers such as stratex networks  nera networks and other major oems  and added several significant new customers to endwave s customer list 
in february  we acquired certain assets from the broadband business of arcom wireless  inc  a subsidiary of dover corporation 
this acquisition was structured as an asset purchase  and included transceiver designs and intellectual property required to manufacture and supply a ghz integrated transceiver product to an existing endwave customer 
no employees from arcom were retained in connection with this acquisition 
in may  we acquired certain assets of verticom inc  an independent corporation that produced yig based oscillators and frequency synthesizers 
at the time  verticom was anticipating liquidation which subsequently did occur 
this acquisition was structured as an asset purchase  and included product designs and intellectual property  inventory  equipment and a contract to supply a customer not previously doing business with endwave 
no employees from verticom were retained in connection with this acquisition  however some employees were employed on a temporary basis in order to effect a transfer of the production process 
telecommunications market overview the telecommunications industry has seen many significant changes and developments over the last few years 
the rapid acceptance and broad use of the internet has created the need for communications networks that are capable of handling large amounts of digital traffic 
the widespread use of wireless communications and the desire for mobile  high speed internet access by consumers and businesses has created needs for communication solutions that have not been met by traditional wire line systems 
the continued growth in the use of cellular phones and other wireless communications devices  such as pc and personal digital assistants pdas  has created a large market opportunity for broadband wireless infrastructure 

table of contents developing countries realize that a key requirement for their economic growth is the availability of modern communications systems to provide widely available and reliable phone and data services 
rather than installing the traditional wired networks  they often choose cellular networks as the best solution since they are the easiest and fastest to deploy and provide the mobility that so many desire 
in such countries where wired infrastructure is unavailable or expensive  the interconnection of the various cell sites is accomplished by the use of microwave radio links 
developing nations such as china and india have created a significant demand for such microwave radio links 
in europe and other developed countries  as new networks are deployed or additional cell sites are installed to handle increased traffic density  these new cell sites are also often connected to the existing networks through the use of microwave radio links 
this application  commonly referred to as cellular backhaul  has resulted in the installation of hundreds of thousands of radio links over the last decade 
as users desire messaging services and internet access from their cellular phones and pdas  network integrators and service providers are moving to new generations of cellular systems known as g and g or rd generation systems 
it has been predicted that these new systems will require as much as three times the number of base stations as first generation systems and that each base station will require higher capacity backhaul to the network 
further  because of the high volume of the backhaul traffic and the importance of maintaining a robust backhaul network  it is anticipated that future networks will use a mesh or token ring structure rather than the star architectures employed today 
when these next generation systems are deployed  we believe that they will create a demand for a large number of new microwave radios 
in addition  as spectrums become crowded and the cost of bandwidth increases  network operators are expected to require higher performance radios that provide higher capacities and greater spectral efficiency 
businesses and consumers continue to fuel the need for additional bandwidth in the internet infrastructure with the growing use of e mail  audio  and video streaming  corporate data networks  corporate websites  e commerce  electronic data exchange  customer support  supply chain management and telecommuting 
to adequately satisfy these needs  service providers must be able to transport large quantities of data  at high speed  to almost any location  often worldwide 
since not all locations are served by high speed copper wire or fiber optic cable  there is a growing need for broadband wireless access 
while over the long term we believe these fundamental forces are creating needs for greater capacity in the telecommunications infrastructure and for wireless access to that network  the last three years have been very challenging for the entire telecommunications industry including service providers  system integrators  oems and their suppliers 
service providers have struggled with servicing large debt loads incurred to build out their networks  lower than projected subscription rates for some new services  industry wide overcapacity and fierce price competition 
this situation has been further exacerbated by a major slowdown in the us and world economies 
this has resulted in several of the clecs competitive local exchange carrier  declaring bankruptcy  delays in the introduction of new and g networks  and plummeting capital expenditures by the service providers 
the drop in capital expenditures has consequently impacted all those who produce telecommunications equipment including system integrators  oems and subsystem suppliers such as endwave 
the difficulties of the recent past notwithstanding  current developments suggest that the situation is improving and that a level of stability has returned to the industry 
service providers have significantly improved their cash flow and repaired their balance sheets 
spending for equipment and network systems cannot be expected to return to the inordinately high levels of the late s  however there are signs that a more sustainable growth rate is emerging 
further  new applications for wireless access technologies are developing at both ends of the rf spectrum 
on the lower end of the frequency range at ghz and ghz  the specifications commonly referred to as wi fi are becoming a de facto standard for short range wireless computing 
business professionals  students  and mobile professionals are embracing the technology as the method of choice for connecting to the internet and corporate networks in a mobile setting and while moving about in office buildings and campuses 
sales of wi fi enabled devices nearly tripled in and continued growth is expected in and although endwave s core competencies lie at frequency ranges 
table of contents above ghz  we believe that the broad adoption of wi fi technology will create additional demand for high capacity data links which could generate opportunities for endwave products 
at the higher end of the spectrum  newly fcc approved ghz wide bands at ghz and ghz have commanded the interest of major networking companies such as cisco 
this spectrum is particularly well suited to deliver data rates of gbps over distances of approximately kilometers 
this distance and data rate capability make the technology an ideal candidate to provide high speed internet connectivity to the of the  business buildings that are within mile of the nearest fiber connection but cannot practically access the fiber 
a second application is to use the technology for high speed building to building lan bridging links 
this business opportunity is still nascent and its impact unknown  but endwave is one of a few companies that is capable of designing  developing  testing and manufacturing the rf subsystems for these high frequency wireless systems 
in the specific telecommunications market segment that endwave serves  digital microwave radios  current worldwide production volumes we estimate at  to  units per year  of which approximately are used for cellular backhaul applications 
more than of these were in the to ghz frequency range  where our design and manufacturing processes are focused 
the production of these microwave radios is concentrated in a relatively small number of oems 
of the approximately  to  radios produced last year  the top manufacturers produced more than of the total 
the largest oem producers include alcatel  ericsson  harris  nec  nera  nokia  siemens and stratex networks 
these oems are in turn supplied key components and sub assemblies either by captive internal sources  or by merchant suppliers such as endwave 
of these external merchant suppliers  endwave has a significant market share 
several of our competitors are financially weak and several have exited the business in the past three years 
some industry observers believe that the component and sub assembly supplier base will undergo further consolidation  and endwave in particular has a stated plan to take a leading role in this industry consolidation trend 
adjacent market overview many applications other than terrestrial microwave radios exist for rf subsystems of the type endwave produces 
these include satellite communications systems  defense systems  rf test instruments and various types of security devices 
endwave is actively pursuing all of these applications in an effort to increase our revenues and broaden our market base 
in fiscal  this market area represented million of our revenues or of our total revenues 
the outlook for these market segments is generally positive in the near future 
satellite communication systems are of increasing importance in many existing applications  new applications are being proposed and the current satellite infrastructure is aging 
the combination of these aging factors could generate significant business opportunities in the future 
several existing satellites will come to the end of their useful lives during the next several years and the replacement systems will utilize frequencies well matched to endwave capabilities 
both in the past and at present  endwave has produced equipment utilized in satellite ground terminals 
various defense systems utilize wireless communication channels to transmit and receive both voice and data communications 
a key driver in this application area is the so called intelligent battlefield scenario in which multiple sensors survey the battlefield situation and the data from these sensor systems is then aggregated and provided real time to the battlefield commanders 
such systems require high bandwidth communication capabilities similar to those found in high speed commercial telecommunications systems 
further  new weapons systems will utilize sophisticated radar systems to detect small insurgent force vehicles and personnel 
these applications utilize subsystem modules similar to those used in commercial telecommunications systems 
endwave intends to continue to pursue these applications aggressively 
target customers include the key defense prime contractors such as boeing  northrop grumman  raytheon and lockheed 
additionally  we will continue to market to major system contractors that supply products to these prime contractors 

table of contents the challenge forecasts for future demand of our products and the products of our customers are uncertain 
it is difficult to accurately predict how long the current economic conditions will continue in the united states and other parts of the world  or whether they will improve 
in our telecommunications markets  regulatory conditions affecting radio deployments around the world are changing  the impact of the expected consolidation of service providers is unknown  new spectrums are being allocated and new wireless applications are being created 
these uncertain and changing conditions make it very hard for our customers to predict their specific future product requirements with certainty 
in our adjacent market areas  we face similar uncertainty as to market demands and we are still building our position in these business areas 
however  we believe that in order to be successful in the future our customers will need higher performance products  lower product costs  scalable production with high volume capacity  short product design cycles  broad product portfolio  logistical flexibility  and high product quality 
our solution as a provider of rf subsystems  we design and manufacture a broad portfolio of products  from rf modules to fully integrated transceivers  outdoor units and major subsystem assemblies 
we strive to provide our customers with the products  resources and services that they need to be successful in this changing environment 
we provide superior performance through technological leadership 
technological leadership begins with the people  their capabilities and their experience 
we have a large technical team with broad expertise in device physics  semiconductor device design  circuit design  component and or subsystem design  test engineering and other critical disciplines 
our technical leadership enables us to optimize our products for critical performance factors that are important to our customers 
we provide the technology to optimize such key parameters as spectral efficiency  which is the rate at which data can be transmitted in a given segment of the radio frequency spectrum 
we have extensive experience in the design of rf devices based on gallium arsenide  the semiconductor material most widely used in broadband wireless access applications as well as other less commonly used rf semiconductor materials 
this design expertise gives us the flexibility to optimize our product designs because we are not limited to standard  commercially available semiconductor devices 
we use third party semiconductor fabrication facilities to manufacture the gallium arsenide and other semiconductor devices we design 
our use of third party semiconductor facilities gives us the flexibility to use the process technology that is best suited for each application and eliminates the need for us to invest in and maintain our own semiconductor fabrication facilities 
path to low cost through multiple circuit technologies 
with our proprietary circuit and process technologies  coupled with our advanced manufacturing processes  we believe we are able to provide better solutions related to our customers volume and cost requirements 
we currently employ three distinct circuit technologies as appropriate to meet the needs of our customers and their specific project  including traditional hybrid microwave integrated circuits hmics  monolithic microwave integrated circuits mmics  and flip chip integrated circuits fcics tm 
hmics have many bond wires that must be individually tested and adjusted  or tuned  during the manufacturing process 
our mmic circuits eliminate most of the bond wires used in hmics  allowing us to produce them using automated assembly techniques 
our internal mmic design capability allows us to design mmics that are optimized to the particular circuit application 
our patented fcic technology enables us to design and manufacture 
table of contents rf circuits more cost effectively by using less gallium arsenide material than a typical mmic circuit and significantly fewer wire bonds than hmics 
as a result  fcic circuits lend themselves to high volume  automated manufacturing processes for applications characterized by very high unit volumes and competitive pricing 
during the past year  we have further enhanced this capability by developing and verifying improved circuit substrates that allow more sophisticated circuit configurations and further reduce the cost of this circuit type 
we refer to this new technology as mlms tm or multilithic microsystem 
our circuit technologies have been supplemented by our development of the epsilon tm microwave packaging system to reduce costs even further 
these technical advantages  coupled with our advanced manufacturing process  we believe will allow us to significantly reduce product costs 
short product design cycle 
we have developed an extensive library of rf circuit and device designs that allow us to rapidly and economically combine standard circuits and devices into custom assemblies to quickly satisfy the various performance and frequency requirements of our customers and we have the expertise and facilities to rapidly prototype and test a new design 
we believe that this ability to migrate from prototype to volume production in a short period of time is an important competitive advantage 
broad product portfolio 
we offer a range of products at multiple levels of integration  from single function rf modules to integrated transceivers  to address most any customer need 
this allows our customers to select the products that best complement their internal capabilities and manufacturing requirements 
our product design capability supports a broad range of frequencies  from ghz to ghz  and addresses multiple market applications 
this enables us to rapidly design products for new frequencies or applications and facilitate our customers product introduction plans and schedules 
scalable manufacturing with high volume  low cost production capability 
we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of microwave rf subsystems and a market leading supplier in the commercial broadband wireless segment 
our traditional manufacturing approach allows our customers to develop new products in relatively small quantities during the early stages of development 
as their design becomes proven and is moved into production  these products can either be maintained with traditional assembly approaches  moved into an automated process where volumes justify this transition  or moved to our offshore manufacturing facility 
our advanced assembly and testing capabilities and multiple production lines allow us to rapidly achieve high volume production to meet our customers increasing volume demands 
we have a long term gallium arsenide device supply agreement with velocium  which is an operating unit of northrop grumman  which further enhances our manufacturing capabilities and ensures an adequate supply of gallium arsenide devices 
logistical flexibility 
we provide our customers with a high degree of logistical flexibility through the use of multi year frame agreements with logistical plans that are tailored to their individual needs 
these frame agreements usually cover a variety of products and frequencies  with varying degrees of flexibility on quantities and delivery rates 
additionally  for some customers we provide enhanced inventory management services by maintaining point of use inventories in their facilities 
this allows our customers to rapidly adjust to the changing demands of their market 
high quality 
our customers  whether focused in telecommunications  defense or other adjacent markets  expend considerable financial and human resources to develop and introduce new products 
understandably  they have high demands for quality and reliability once they ve completed their development and are preparing to take their product to market 
many customers find it necessary to design their systems so they will operate or even of the time 
our careful design  advanced manufacturing and iso certified facilities are intended to provide the high reliability required for today s commercial and defense systems 
our strategy our objective is to be a leading global supplier of rf subsystems for broadband wireless and other applications 
we intend to become the rf subsystem supplier of choice for microwave systems built by 
table of contents the leading companies in telecommunications and other markets 
the major elements of our strategy include maintain and expand our strong position in our core market 
the majority of our revenues is derived from production of low and medium data rate radios  in the to ghz frequency range  for use in cellular backhaul systems 
today this represents the largest and one of the most stable portions of the market 
we intend to maintain and expand our penetration in these areas  both in terms of current and new customers  customer programs  and frequency ranges 
extend our technological leadership 
we will continue to invest in next generation research and development  maintain our team of talented engineers and scientists  and build on our manufacturing technologies 
provide our customers with increased logistical flexibility 
in this uncertain market  it is difficult for our customers to predict exact products  frequencies and quantities 
by developing broader band circuits and by using multi product  multi year supply agreements  flexible logistics plans and short manufacturing cycles  we help our customers to quickly respond to market demands 
target new frequencies and emerging applications 
we currently offer a wide range of products that support the principal frequency bands currently used for broadband wireless backhaul and access  and defense applications 
we intend to offer products for higher data rate radios  new frequency bands and emerging market applications as opportunities arise 
provide best in class manufacturing capability 
our circuit design  manufacturing and testing processes and continuous improvement programs have helped to bring manufacturing innovations to an industry that has historically utilized labor intensive manufacturing techniques 
we will continue to improve our lean manufacturing methods that have produced significant cost reductions and significantly higher outputs with fewer employed assets 
reduce costs through offshore manufacturing 
endwave has responded to customer and market requirements for lower cost solutions with the establishment of a partnership with a major manufacturing subcontractor in southeast asia 
by the end of  over of our product was manufactured in our subcontractor s facility 
this partnership and the product manufacturing are managed by endwave s full time  in country management team with extensive experience in process engineering and manufacturing management 
we draw on the local economy to obtain lower cost of materials  labor  and facilities than is available in the united states 
maintain rapid design and prototyping capability 
we intend to maintain our ability to rapidly design and prototype new products that meet our customers needs 
we believe we can achieve this with our multiple design and manufacturing techniques 
leverage strategic relationship with velocium 
our supply agreement with velocium provides us with a long term supply of gallium arsenide devices at a preferred cost 
we believe that our supply of these devices from velocium is a competitive advantage because the supply of gallium arsenide devices may become constrained in the future as the broadband wireless access market grows 
in addition  we have access to velocium s research and design expertise in the areas of rf and digital circuit design technologies as well as advanced semiconductor materials 
we believe this access represents a significant competitive advantage 
secure new design wins to expand and diversify our customer base 
we intend to use our technology  skilled design teams  short design cycles and manufacturing capability to secure new designs wins with new and existing customers 
we will focus our efforts on the top microwave radio suppliers who represent over of the total demand and on key opportunities in adjacent markets that match our capabilities and competitive strengths 
use our unique strengths to further penetrate adjacent markets 
we have unique technology  experience  and capabilities in the design of high volume microwave modules and subsystems in the to ghz frequency range 
these are attributes that are useful in other adjacent markets such as 
table of contents instrumentation  scientific  automotive radar  security  fiber optics and military systems 
we will continue to pursue additional opportunities in these adjacent markets where our technologies are advantageous 
pursue additional acquisitions where appropriate 
in order to achieve our goal of being the leading global supplier of rf subsystems  we intend to continue to pursue additional acquisition opportunities that are strategically and financially advantageous 
products our products include amplifiers  multipliers  frequency converters  oscillators  frequency synthesizers  integrated transceivers and key components of outdoor units odus that enable the transmission and reception of data signals in communication applications such as cellular backhaul  broadband wireless access  and network trunking  as well as other adjacent markets requiring these technologies and products 
in addition to those products designed and developed by endwave  we also provide build to print btp manufacturing services for products that have been designed by our customers 
while the majority of our existing customers are wireless systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers serving the broadband wireless market  a portion of our revenues are derived from customers who use our products to satisfy needs for defense  instrumentation  scientific and other adjacent markets 
microwave radio transceivers are our core product offering  representing approximately of our net revenues for transceivers are a critical subsystem found in microwave and millimeter wave radios 
these subsystems function as the heart of the wireless system by combining transmit and receive functions in a single package  which gets built into the overall radio system 
endwave specializes in high frequency transceivers in the range of ghz to ghz  for point to point and point to multipoint communications applications 
customers we sell our products primarily to global wireless systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
during we shipped products to more than different customers 
the ten customers that attributed the greatest proportion of our revenues in the year ended december   were allgon ab sweden harris corporation usa intracom greece lockheed martin corporation usa nera networks norway nokia networks finland northrop grumman space and mission systems corp 
usa siemens ag italy stratex networks  inc usa zeta usa a relatively limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our sales 
for the years ending december   and  sales to our largest customer  nokia  accounted for  and of our total revenues  respectively 
in  stratex networks also accounted for more than of our revenues 
looking forward  we cannot predict whether any significant customer in prior periods will continue to be a significant customer in future periods 
further  we expect that a high percentage of our product sales will continue to be to a rather limited number of customers in the foreseeable future 
sales product and development fee revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
shipments to international customers accounted for  and of 
table of contents total product sales in  and  respectively 
additionally  many of our domestic customers sell their products  which incorporate components and subsystems sold by us  outside the united states 
competition competition in the market for rf subsystems for broadband wireless access systems is intense 
in the markets for rf modules  transceivers and outdoor units  we primarily compete with  among others  the following merchant suppliers eyal microwave israel filtronics plc uk forem a division of allen telecom italy millitron inc korea mitel italy microelectronics technology  inc mti taiwan remec  inc usa teledyne technologies incorporated usa thales group sa france xytrans inc usa in addition to those companies listed above with whom we may compete directly  there are oems  for example  ericsson  that design and manufacture their own rf subsystems for use in their products 
to the extent that oems presently  or may in the future  produce their own rf subsystems  we lose the opportunity to gain a customer and the related sales opportunities 
conversely  if they should decide to outsource their requirements  this may significantly expand the market available to endwave 
we are committed to providing superior product performance  logistical flexibility and manufacturing excellence  as we believe these factors are critical to our customers decision to purchase our products 
we believe that the cost structure of our products is competitive in each of our target markets 
many factors contribute to the final pricing of our products  including the costs for customer specific designs  the scale of production  and the logistical arrangements 
while we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in our chosen markets  some of our current and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
if we were unable to compete successfully  our future operations and financial results would be harmed 
backlog our order backlog consists of a combination of standard purchase orders  annual purchase agreements and multi year frame agreements 
the large majority of our orders are pursuant to multi year frame agreements with major commercial oems 
these frame agreements usually include an estimate of the expected annual quantities during the contract and include a logistics plan that provides for a monthly rolling forecast of usage from the customer 
these forecasts  however  are primarily for material and capacity planning purposes and are subject to significant changes from month to month and quarter to quarter 
the logistics plans generally allow the customers a high degree of flexibility in changing  rescheduling or canceling forecasted requirements 
because these customers are only required to take delivery of the firm portion of the forecasts  which is usually approximately a month 
they have the ability to significantly change forecasted delivery dates and quantities 
for these reasons we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenues 
backlog includes all purchase orders and contracts for products with expected delivery dates through december  our backlog at march  was approximately million as compared to a backlog of million as of march  there can be no assurance that the current backlog will necessarily lead to actual sales in any future period 
of our current backlog  approximately is 
table of contents attributable to orders received from nokia and is attributable to orders received from allgon 
if we were to lose these customers or if orders by nokia  allgon or other customers were to decrease or be delayed  our operating results and financial condition would be adversely impacted 
governmental regulations our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that are subject to various united states regulations and similar laws and regulations adopted by regulatory authorities in other countries 
regulatory changes  including changes in allocation of available frequency spectrum  could significantly impact our operations by restricting development efforts by our customers  making obsolete current products or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
changes in  or failure to comply with  applicable domestic and international regulations could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the increasing demand for wireless communication has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for these products and services  generally following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies 
the delays inherent in this governmental approval process have caused in the past  and may cause in the future  the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of installation of communications systems by our customers  which in turn may negatively affect the sale of our products to those customers 
patents and intellectual property rights our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our products 
as of december   we had united states patents issued  many with associated foreign filings and patents 
our issued patents include those relating to basic circuit and device designs  semiconductors  our proprietary fcic tm circuit technology and various circuit and system designs 
in addition  we jointly hold two patents with at t pertaining to sectorized communications systems and jointly hold one patent with superconducting supertechnologies  inc relating to satellite communications 
our issued patents expire between and of all our patents  we consider two patents relating to our fcic tm circuit technology and a patent relating to our yig oscillator technology to be the most valuable 
with regard to our pending patent applications  no patents may be issued as a result of these or any future applications 
if they are issued  any patent claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and any right granted hereunder may not provide meaningful protection to us 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products and use similar manufacturing techniques 
we generally enter into confidentiality and assignment of rights to inventions agreements with our employees  and confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with our strategic partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited outside of the united states  europe and japan 
we may not be able to obtain any meaningful intellectual property protection in other countries and territories 
additionally  we may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright  or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we occasionally agree to incorporate a customer s or supplier s intellectual property into our designs  in which cases we have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of that intellectual property 
we also license technology from velocium  which is an operating unit of northrop grumman 
there are no limitations on our rights to make  use or sell products we may develop in the future utilizing the technology licensed to us by velocium  provided that the products are for commercial customers and non satellite applications 

table of contents steps taken by us to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers may not be successful 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
the wireless access industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
we have received  and may receive in the future  notices of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
in addition  the invalidity of our patents may be asserted or prosecuted against us 
furthermore  in a patent or trade secret action  we could be required to withdraw the product or products as to which infringement was claimed from the market or redesign products offered for sale or under development 
we have also at times agreed to indemnification obligations in favor of our customers and strategic partners that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
these indemnification obligations would be triggered for reasons including our sale or supply to a customer or strategic partner of a product which was later discovered to infringe upon another party s proprietary rights 
irrespective of the validity or successful assertion of such claims we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our resources with respect to the defense of such claims 
to address any potential claims or actions asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  in such an instance  a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
research and development the goal of our research and development efforts are to reduce the cost and increase the functionality and performance of our products  while adapting them to the specifications required of our customers and of new markets for our products 
in addition  substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient manufacturing methods necessary for competitive pricing and improved gross margins of our products  while maintaining high quality standards required by our customers 
other development efforts include expansion of existing product families and initiatives to combine products from our various complementary product lines to create additional functionality 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance and cost reduce our existing products  and to develop and introduce new products to maintain our technological leadership and meet a wider range of customer needs 
however  as a business we recognize the need to balance research and development spending with running a profitable business and have reduced our research effort accordingly 
our research and development and related engineering expenses were approximately million  million and million  in each of   and  respectively 
the decrease in spending was primarily the result of staff reductions associated with matching our research and development spending to the current needs of the industry and our increasing engineering efficiency that required less resources to execute on our r d program 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including in manufacturing  in product and process engineering  in sales and marketing and in general and administrative 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement with us and we believe that our relations with our employees are good

risk factors stockholders or potential investors considering the purchase of shares of our common stock should carefully consider the following risk factors  in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial could also impair our business operations 
we expect to operate near our break even point and may not be profitable in the future 
we have had a history of losses 
we had net losses of million  million  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while we have taken ongoing restructuring actions  there is no guarantee that these restructuring actions will enable the company to achieve consistent profitability in the future 
our failure to attain consistent profitability may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the future 
we depend upon a small number of customers  and the loss of any of them  or their failure to sell their systems  would limit our ability to generate revenues 
we depend  and expect to remain dependent  on a relatively small number of customers for sales of our products 
if our customers reduce orders for our products  we could lose revenues and suffer damage to our reputation in the industry 
for the year ended december   sales to nokia  stratex networks  and siemens accounted for of total revenues 
for the years ended december   and  sales to nokia accounted for  and  respectively  of total revenues 
the loss of  or significant reduction in demand from any one of our major customers  particularly nokia  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
most of our customers are not under any commitment to purchase products from us  except on a purchase order basis 
under our contract with nokia  nokia is required to provide us with a weekly rolling forecast for the upcoming week period and we are obligated to provide products to them in a consignment stock location 
the amount and type of product shipped to the consignment location is based upon nokia s estimate of need and rf frequency 
revenues are recognized at the time product is withdrawn by nokia from the consignment location  or at the latest  after four months have passed since the date of receipt 
as a result  there could be up to a four month period whereby we would not recognize revenues for product previously shipped 
deliveries are based on forecast but there is no guarantee that the forecast will be fulfilled 
forecasts may vary greatly and can be changed without notice 
our customers may not have or use the financial  marketing  technological and other resources necessary to ensure that their solutions will succeed in a marketplace characterized by rapid technological changes and intense competition 
for example  communications service providers may insist that wireless systems integrators provide extensive financing for the deployment of large broadband wireless access networks  and our customers may be unwilling or unable to provide the necessary financial resources 
if the wireless systems integrators  particularly nokia  that we supply were not successful in selling their broadband wireless access systems for any reason  our operating results would be harmed 
until recently  our cost of product revenues has exceeded our product revenues  and because we expect competitive conditions will force us to reduce prices in the future  we must achieve further cost reductions in order to maintain sufficient positive gross margins to remain profitable 
we have reported negative gross margins from inception until the fourth quarter of if we are not able to continue to reduce our per unit cost of product revenues to a sufficient degree  we may not be 
table of contents able to maintain positive gross margins 
we expect market conditions  particularly declining prices for competing broadband access solutions  will force us to reduce our prices in the future 
in order to reduce these costs  we must continue to migrate our products to designs that require lower cost materials  improve our manufacturing efficiencies and successfully move production to low cost  offshore locations 
the combined effects of these actions may not be sufficient to achieve the cost reductions needed to maintain positive gross margins and to sustain profitability 
our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly and are likely to continue to do so in future periods 
these results may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to fall 
our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
it is likely that our operating results in one or more future quarters may be below the expectation of security analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock almost certainly would decline 
our operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including but may not limited to variations in the timing and size of  or cancellations or reductions of  customer orders and shipments  variations in the availability  cost and quality of components from our suppliers  particularly from our single source suppliers and suppliers of scarce components  competitive factors  including pricing  availability and demand for competing products  constraints on our manufacturing capacity  variability of the product development and sales cycle with our customers  variations in our manufacturing yields and other factors affecting our manufacturing costs  changes in our sales prices  changes in the mix of products with different gross margins  failure to meet milestones under any significant development contracts  obsolescence of our component inventories  hiring and loss of personnel  particularly in manufacturing  research and development and sales and marketing  and product defect claims and associated warranty expenses 
we have a lengthy product development and sales cycle 
as a result  we must invest substantial financial and technical resources in a potential sale before we know whether the sale will occur 
if the sale does not occur  we may not have the opportunity to sell products to that customer until another generation of its system is developed 
our products are highly technical and accordingly our sales efforts involve a collaborative and iterative process with our customers to determine their specific requirements and design an appropriate solution 
depending on the product  the typical product development and sales cycle can take anywhere from three to twelve months  and we incur significant expenses as part of this process without any assurance of resulting revenues 
during the product development phase  our engineers typically work with the customer to define the product and design a prototype product for the customer to evaluate 
we generate revenues only if our product is selected for incorporation into a customer s system and that system is accepted in the marketplace 
if our product is not selected  or the customers development program is discontinued  we generally will not have an opportunity to sell our product to that customer until that customer develops a new generation of its system 
in the past  we have had difficulty meeting some of our major customers stated volume and cost requirements 
the length of our product development and sales cycle makes us 
table of contents particularly vulnerable to the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in orders by a customer because we may be unable to quickly replace the lost or reduced sales 
we may not be able to design our products as quickly as our customers require  which could cause us to lose sales and may harm our reputation 
existing and potential customers typically demand that we design products for them under difficult time constraints 
in the current market environment  the need to respond quickly is particularly important 
if we are unable to commit the necessary resources to complete a project for a potential customer within the requested timeframe  we may lose a potential sale 
our ability to design products within the time constraints demanded by a customer will depend on the number of product design professionals who are available to focus on that customer s project and the availability of professionals with the requisite level of expertise is limited 
each of our products is designed for a specific range of frequencies 
because different national governments license different portions of the frequency spectrum for the broadband wireless access market  and because communications service providers that use broadband wireless access systems license specific frequencies as they become available  we must adapt our products rapidly to use a wide range of different frequencies in order to remain competitive 
this may require the design of products at a number of different frequencies simultaneously 
this design process can be difficult and time consuming  could increase our costs and could cause delays in the delivery of products to our customers  which may harm our reputation and affect the timing of our revenues 
we may not be able to manufacture and deliver our products as quickly as our customers require  which could cause us to lose sales or incur penalties and would harm our reputation 
at times in the past  we have not produced products in the volume requested by our customers 
in the future  we may not be able to manufacture products and deliver them to our customers at the times  and in the volumes they require 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver products in a timely fashion  our reputation may be harmed  we may jeopardize existing orders and lose potential future sales and we may be forced to pay penalties to our customers 
manufacturing delays and interruptions can occur for many reasons including but not limited to lack of sufficient capacity  the failure of a supplier to deliver needed components on a timely basis  or with acceptable quality  poor manufacturing yields  labor disputes  manufacturing personnel shortages  equipment failures  natural disasters  transportation disruptions  acts of terrorism  changes in import export regulations  infrastructure failures  and political instability 
the manufacturing of our products is complex 
the yield  or percentage of products manufactured that conform to required specifications  can decrease for many reasons  including materials containing impurities  equipment not functioning in accordance with requirements or human error 
if our yield is lower than we expect  we may not be able to deliver products on time 

table of contents we rely heavily on our southeast asia offshore manufacturing partners to produce product for us 
if our partners are unable to produce product in sufficient quantities or with adequate quality or they choose to terminate our partnership arrangements  we may not be able to fulfill our production commitments to our customers  which could cause us to lose sales or incur penalties and would harm our reputation 
as part of our operating strategy  we partially or wholly outsource the assembly and test of some of our subassemblies and finished products to offshore partners located in southeast asia 
we plan to continue this arrangement as a key element of our operating strategy 
if these vendors do not provide us with high quality products and services in a timely manner  or if one or more of these vendors terminates its relationship with us  we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis 
factors that could result in an interruption of supply from our offshore partners include  but may not be limited to changes in local regulations and government policy  currency fluctuations  lack of sufficient capacity  the failure of a supplier to deliver needed components on a timely basis  or with acceptable quality  poor manufacturing yields  labor disputes  manufacturing personnel shortages  equipment failures  natural disasters  transportation disruptions  acts of terrorism  changes in import export regulations  infrastructure failures  and political instability 
in the event of an interruption of supply from our offshore partners  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose potential future sales 
our reliance on velocium and other third party semiconductor providers to manufacture our gallium arsenide devices may cause a significant delay in our ability to fill orders and limit our ability to assure product quality and control costs 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
we currently rely on the semiconductor fabrication facilities of velocium  an operating unit of northrop grumman  and other third parties to manufacture substantially all of the gallium arsenide and other semiconductor devices incorporated in our products 
the loss of our relationship with any of these third parties or our use of their semiconductor fabrication facilities  particularly velocium s facility  and any resulting delay or reduction in the supply of gallium arsenide devices to us  will impact our ability to fulfill customer orders and could damage our relationships with our customers 
our current supply agreement with velocium expires in december of we may not be able to negotiate an extension to this agreement on favorable terms  if at all 
we also may not be successful in forming alternative supply arrangements that provide us with a sufficient supply of gallium arsenide devices 
because there are limited numbers of third party semiconductor fabrication facilities that use the particular process technologies we select for our products and have sufficient capacity 
table of contents to meet our needs  using alternative or additional third party semiconductor fabrication facilities would require an extensive qualification process that could prevent or delay product shipments 
since we do not own or control any of these third party semiconductor suppliers  any change in the corporate structure or ownership of the corporations that own these foundries  could have a negative effect on or future relations and ability to negotiate favorable supply agreements 
our reliance on these third party suppliers involves several additional risks  including reduced control over manufacturing costs  delivery times  reliability and quality of the products incorporating these devices 
the fabrication of semiconductor devices is a complex and precise process 
there are many factors that can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous devices on a wafer to be nonfunctional including  but not limited to minute impurities  difficulties or inconsistencies in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a semiconductor wafer  and wafer breakage 
we expect that our customers will continue to establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that must be met by our products 
our third party semiconductor fabrication facilities may not be able to achieve and maintain acceptable production yields in the future 
in the past  we have experienced delays in product shipments from our third party semiconductor fabrication facilities  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
to the extent these suppliers suffer failures or defects  or delay deliveries to us  we could experience lost revenues  increased costs and delays in  cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments  any of which would harm our business 
because of the scarcity of some components and our dependence on single suppliers for some other components  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of components  or we may be required to pay higher prices or to purchase components of lesser quality 
we currently purchase a number of components  some from single source suppliers for which alternative sources may not be readily available  including  but not limited to electronic filters  circuit carrier assemblies  voltage controlled oscillators  semiconductor devices  yttrium iron garnet components  magnetic components  and frequency references 
any delay or interruption in the supply of these or other components could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our products  harm our reputation and cause a reduction in our revenues 
in addition  any increase in the cost of the components that we use in our products could make our products less competitive and lower our margins 
our single source suppliers could enter into exclusive agreements with or be acquired by one of our competitors  increase their prices  refuse to sell their products to us  discontinue products or go out of business 
even to the extent alternative suppliers are available to us  identifying them and entering into arrangements with them is difficult and time consuming  and they may not meet our quality standards 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of required components on the same or substantially the same terms 
additionally  consolidations among our suppliers could result in other sole source suppliers for us in the future 

table of contents because we do not have long term commitments from many of our customers  we must estimate customer demand  and errors in our estimates would have negative effects on our inventory levels and revenues 
our primary market  the telecommunications industry  has been characterized in recent years by severe demand fluctuations and down turns 
further  the overall economic slow down in the us and other economies has exacerbated these difficulties 
this has led to fluctuating order forecasts from some of our customers 
there can be no certainty as to the degree of the severity or duration of these fluctuations in demand 
we also cannot predict the extent and timing  of the impact of the economic downturn in the united states and the worldwide downturn for the telecommunications industry on economies in europe and other countries and geographic regions 
our sales are generally made on the basis of formal agreements and purchase orders  which may be later modified or canceled by the customer  rather than firm long term purchase commitments 
we have historically been required to place firm orders for products and manufacturing equipment with our suppliers up to six months prior to the anticipated delivery date and  on occasion  prior to receiving an order for the product  based on our forecasts of customer demands 
our sales process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates  causing excess inventory to accrue or a lack of manufacturing capacity when needed 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect or at all 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would harm our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity were available  we would lose revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
on occasion  we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders and were unable to benefit from this increased demand 
because we may expand our manufacturing capacity in advance of demand  our manufacturing facilities may continue to be underutilized  which may harm our operating results 
as part of our strategy  we may expand our manufacturing capacity beyond the level required for our current sales 
as a result  our manufacturing facilities in the future may continue to be underutilized from time to time 
we expand our manufacturing capacity based on industry projections for future growth 
even if the broadband wireless industry experiences significant growth  we could still be unsuccessful in selling our products and growing along with the industry 
if demand for our products does not increase significantly  underutilization of our manufacturing facilities will likely continue and could harm our profitability and other operating results 
conversely  if we do not maintain adequate manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products  we will lose opportunities for additional sales 
any failure to have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand would harm our market share and operating results 
our products may contain component  manufacturing or design defects or may not meet our customers performance criteria  which could harm our customer relationships  industry reputation  revenues and profitability 
we have experienced manufacturing quality problems with our products in the past and may have similar problems in the future 
as a result of these problems  we have replaced components in some products  or replaced the product  in accordance with our product warranties 
our product warranties typically last one to three years 
as a result of component  manufacturing or design defects  we may be required to repair or replace a substantial number of products under our product warranties 
further  our customers may discover latent defects in our products that were not apparent when the warranty period expired 
these defects may cause repair or replacement expenses beyond the normal warranty  the loss of customers or damage to our reputation 
we have experienced this type of failure in the past and have had to provide reserves for repairing the affected units 
we cannot guarantee that similar failures will not occur in the future resulting in significant expenses and charges in future periods 

table of contents some of the contracts that we have entered into or assumed during acquisitions may contain clauses making endwave liable for consequential damages or other indirect costs that customers may incur 
these indirect costs may be significantly higher than the cost of repair or replacement of the endwave product 
we typically warrant our products for a period of one to three years  during which time we have the option to repair or replace any faulty products that are returned to us during the warranty period 
in addition  some contracts require that if there are hidden or latent defects  or defects that appear after the warranty period which could not be detected during normal inspection  we shall undertake any and all necessary corrective actions  including but not limited to redesigning the parts and replacing defective parts in the field 
if mutually agreed  repair or replacement of defective units can be undertaken by the customer  who we shall compensate for actual costs 
some radios incorporating our transceivers and manufactured and shipped by one of our customers are experiencing degraded performance after installation in the field 
the cause of the degradation has been identified to be a faulty electronic component supplied by one of our vendors 
we believe the cause of the component s out of specification performance has been identified and corrected 
although the transceiver products were delivered under a contract between endwave and the customer  the component supplier has agreed to compensate our customer for the indirect costs associated with the repair and replacement of the degraded radios and modules 
these indirect costs include the costs associated with removing and replacing the radios in the field as well as removing and replacing the transceiver module in the radio 
subsequently we have reached an agreement with the component supplier to share a portion of these repair and replacement costs 
during  we provided million for warranty charges to cover the actual repair of the transceivers containing faulty components of which  has been used 
we believe that this reserve is adequate to both cover our actual repair costs and to fully cover all liability for our share of the indirect costs for which our supplier is responsible 
any failure to appropriately protect our intellectual property could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our products 
with regard to our pending patent applications  no patents may be issued as a result of these or any future applications 
if they are issued  any patent claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and any right granted hereunder may not provide meaningful protection to us 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products and use similar manufacturing techniques 
we generally enter into confidentiality and assignment of rights to inventions agreements with our employees  and confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with our strategic partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited  or unenforceable outside of the united states  europe and japan 
we may not be able to obtain any meaningful intellectual property protection in other countries and territories 
additionally  we may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright  or trademark protection outside of the united states or to discontinue support of existing patents  copyrights or trademarks within the united states or foreign countries 
we occasionally agree to incorporate a customer s or supplier s intellectual property into our designs  in which cases we have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of that intellectual property 

table of contents we also license technology from velocium  an operating unit of northrop grumman 
there are no limitations on our rights to make  use or sell products we may develop in the future utilizing the technology licensed to us by velocium  provided that the products are for commercial customers and non satellite applications 
steps taken by us to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or that of our customers may not be successful 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
as part of the strategy for the growth and expansion of our business  we may make additional acquisitions that could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
as part of our business strategy  we may invest in or acquire other businesses  technologies or assets  or enter into strategic relationships with third parties 
for future acquisitions  we may issue additional stock  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or incur large and immediate write offs 
with the exception of the integration of operations experienced following our merger with trw milliwave  our acquisition of certain assets of m a com from tyco electronics  our acquisition of the broadband assets of the fixed wireless division of signal technology corporation  our acquisition of certain assets of arcom and our acquisition of certain assets of verticom  we have no experience in integrating acquired businesses with our existing business 
our operation of any acquired businesses would involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to problems combining any purchased operations with our own operations  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
we depend on our key personnel 
skilled personnel in our industry can be in short supply 
if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional qualified personnel  our ability to develop and successfully market our products would be harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales and marketing  research and development and manufacturing personnel 
skilled personnel in our industry can be in short supply 
to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may be required to grant large option or other stock based incentive awards  which may be highly dilutive to other stockholders 
we may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  prospective employees  given the current volatility of the stock prices of technology focused companies  could perceive the stock option component of our compensation package overly risky and require more significant salary or cash bonus incentives for that reason 
we are particularly dependent on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  these persons would be very difficult to replace  and our business could be seriously harmed 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies 

table of contents our ability to increase our sales in international markets may be limited by risks related to international trade and marketing 
for the years ended december   and   and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from sales invoiced and shipped to customers outside the united states 
in addition  some of our united states based customers may sell products  which incorporate our products  into international markets 
adverse international economic conditions or developments could in the future negatively affect our revenues and sales by our customers into these regions  which would impact our revenues 
in addition to the uncertainty as to our ability to maintain and expand our international presence  there are certain risks inherent in foreign operations  including  but not limited to changing regulations of various countries or regulating agencies effecting radio deployments and spectrum use  difficulties in complying with foreign laws and regulations and obtaining foreign governmental approvals and permits  delays in or prohibitions on exporting products resulting from export restrictions for our products and technologies  fluctuations in foreign currencies and the united states dollar  especially the euro  political and economic instability  unforeseen effects of terrorism and terrorist activities  adverse tax consequences  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
in addition  foreign laws treat the protection of proprietary rights and intellectual property differently from laws in the united states and may not protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property to the same extent as united states laws 
we currently transact business only in us dollars 
in the future  economic or competitive situations may require us to conduct business in other currencies 
if this were to happen  we could become subject to currency exchange rate volatility  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we conduct all of our current business in us dollars 
in the future  economic conditions or competitive pressures may require us to sell product in other currencies  especially the euro because of the high concentration of current and potential customers in countries that have adopted the euro 
if this was to occur and our contracts did not provide currency protection  we could experience significant currency exchange rate volatility 
that volatility could have serious impacts on dollar value of our sales and subsequently on our operating results and financial condition 
many of our customers operate in euro based economies 
the current rise in the value of the euro could make their products noncompetitive in world markets thereby reducing their revenues and causing endwave to also lose revenues 
many of our customers operate in countries that have adopted the euro as their standard currency 
the recent rise in the euro could make products built in those countries noncompetitive in world markets due to the relative strength of the euro 
if this were to happen  it is likely that our customers would lose sales and endwave would subsequently see reduced demand 
further  similar currency effects may require our customers to reduce their prices  bringing further pressure on endwave to reduce its prices 
such price reductions offered to our customers could harm our margins  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could impose significant burdens on us  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we use a small number of hazardous substances to produce our products 
if we fail to comply with present or future governmental regulations related to the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes  we may have our manufacturing operations suspended and we may be assessed fines 
we may also be required to alter our manufacturing processes or even cease operations in locations where we cannot become compliant with applicable government regulation  which would result in significant costs 
in particular  we face the costs and risks associated with a transition to lead free solders in our products 
governmental regulations could also require that we incur expensive remediation costs or other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
we could also face future liabilities in civil actions for violations of environmental laws and regulations 
liability for cleanup under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act is joint and several 
consequently  if other parties that share responsibility with us for contamination at any site are unable to pay for their share of any damages or remediation  we may be held liable to pay for some or all of their share 
the broadband wireless access industry is relatively new and its future is uncertain 
if significant demand for this technology does not develop  it will limit our ability to grow our revenues 
broadband wireless access technology is one of several possible ways to provide high speed infrastructure for transmission of voice  video and data 
however  the level of demand for high speed access will be at least partially dependent upon the development of end user applications that will require higher data rates  and their acceptance and use by the market 
if this demand will be significant and at what rate it will be created is not known at this time 
broadband wireless access technology is relatively new and unproven in the marketplace 
this technology may prove unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment  in which case it is unlikely we could generate enough revenues to obtain and sustain profitability 
many factors will influence the success or failure of broadband wireless access technology  including  but not limited to its capacity to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of video  voice and data  its cost effectiveness and performance compared to other forms of broadband access  the prices and performance of which continue to improve  its reliability and security  whether the products can be manufactured in sufficient volume  its suitability for a sufficient number of geographic regions  the availability of sufficient frequencies for wireless communications service providers to deploy products at commercially reasonable rates  the availability of sufficient site locations for wireless communications service providers to install products at commercially reasonable rates  the development of user applications that will create the demand for higher capacity infrastructure for voice  video and data traffic  safety and environmental concerns regarding broadband wireless transmissions  and permission by domestic and international regulatory authorities to allow construction of new wireless systems 

table of contents many competing technologies serve our broadband access market  and if the broadband wireless access technologies upon which our products are based do not succeed as a solution for broadband access  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
providers of broadband wireless access solutions compete with providers of other high speed solutions  including digital subscriber lines  cable  fiber and other high speed wire  satellite and wireless technologies 
many of these alternative technologies use existing installed infrastructure and have achieved significantly greater market acceptance and penetration than broadband wireless access technologies 
moreover  current broadband wireless access technology has inherent technical limitations that may inhibit its widespread adoption in many areas  including the need for line of sight installation and reduced communication distance in bad weather 
broadband wireless access technology continues to evolve which could cause some service providers to delay product purchases or could result in significant shifts in the products the market favors 
in addition  the need for communications service providers to obtain the rights to install broadband wireless access equipment on rooftops and in other locations may inhibit its widespread adoption 
we expect broadband access technologies to face increasing competitive pressures from both current and future alternative technologies 
in light of these factors  many communications service providers may be reluctant to invest heavily in broadband wireless access solutions and  accordingly  the market for these solutions may fail to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect 
either outcome would limit our sales opportunities 
the broadband wireless access infrastructure equipment industry is intensely competitive  and our failure to compete effectively could reduce our revenues and margins 
competition in the market for rf subsystems for broadband wireless access systems is intense 
in addition  new entrants to the market can emerge and become significant competitors 
some new competitors have been formed by acquiring assets of failed or disbanded companies 
generally  these assets have been acquired at prices much lower than normally expected and this may give these new entrants a cost advantage 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are technical leadership and product performance  time to market in the design and manufacturing of products  manufacturing capability and scalable capacity  financial stability  favorable access to semiconductor materials  price  the ability to migrate to low cost solutions  product breadth  logistical flexibility  and carrier class quality 
there are also wireless systems integrators  for example  ericsson  that design and manufacture their own rf subsystems for internal use 
to the extent wireless systems integrators presently  or may in the future  produce their own rf subsystems  we lose the opportunity to gain a customer and the related sales opportunities 
conversely  if they should decide to outsource their requirements  we may have new opportunities 
many of our current and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
if we were unable to compete successfully  
table of contents our future operations and financial results would be harmed 
for more information with reference to competition  please see the section entitled competition  above 
we must adapt to the rapid technological changes inherent in the broadband wireless access industry in order to succeed 
in order to succeed  we must improve current products and develop and introduce new products that are competitive in terms of price  performance and quality and that adequately address the changing requirements of wireless systems integrators  their customers and subscribers and emerging industry standards 
to accomplish this  we make substantial investments in the research and development of new products for and improvements to existing products 
if these investments do not result in competitive products that generate large volume orders  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we intend to continue to incur substantial research and development and product development expenses 
it is possible that these investments will not generate product revenues sufficient to offset the original investment expense 
government regulation of the communications industry could limit the growth of the markets that we serve or could require costly alterations of our current or future products 
the markets that we serve are highly regulated 
communications service providers must obtain regulatory approvals to operate broadband wireless access networks within specified licensed bands of the frequency spectrum 
the fcc and foreign regulatory agencies have adopted regulations that impose stringent rf emissions standards on the communications industry 
changes to these regulations may require that we alter the performance of our products 
the enactment by governments of new laws or regulations or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations could adversely affect the market for our products 
although there is a present trend toward deregulation and current regulatory developments are favorable to the promotion of new and expanded wireless services  this could change at any time  and future regulatory changes could have a negative impact on us 
further  the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for broadband wireless access products  generally following extensive investigation and deliberation over competing technologies 
in the past  the delays inherent in this governmental approval process have caused  and in the future may cause  the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers 
these delays could affect our ability to allocate our research and development resources effectively  cause our existing and potential customers to delay orders and otherwise harm our ability to generate revenues 
our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
this could cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation  which could subject us to liability  prevent us from selling our products or force us to redesign our products 
the wireless access industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
we have received and may receive in the future notices of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
in addition  the invalidity of our patents may be asserted or prosecuted against us 
furthermore  in a patent or trade secret action  we could be required to withdraw the product or products as to which the infringement was claimed from the market or redesign products offered for sale or under development 
we have also at times agreed to indemnification obligations in favor of our customers and strategic partners that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
these indemnification obligations would be triggered for reasons including our sale or supply to a customer or strategic partner of a product which was later discovered to infringe upon another party s proprietary rights 
irrespective of the validity or successful assertion of intellectual property claims  we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our resources with respect to the defense of any claims 
to address any potential claims or actions asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license

however  in such an instance  a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely since our initial public offering in october the market price of our common stock can fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including  but not limited to our financial performance or the performance of our competitors  technological innovations or other trends or changes in the broadband wireless access industry  successes or failures at significant product evaluations or site demonstrations  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  acquisitions  strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors  decisions by major participants in the communications industry not to purchase products from us or to pursue alternative technologies  decisions by investors to de emphasize investment categories  groups or strategies that include our company or industry  market conditions in the industry  the financial markets and the economy as a whole  and because a small percentage of our stock is owned by public stockholders  it trades in low volumes which could cause volatility in our share price 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  including significant volatility in the market price of our common stock in particular 
these market fluctuations can be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and the market prices for securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
additionally  future stock price volatility for our common stock could provoke the initiation of securities litigation  which may divert substantial management resources and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our existing insurance coverage may not sufficiently cover all costs and claims that could arise out of any such securities litigation 
we anticipate that prices for our common stock will continue to be volatile 
the nasdaq stock market has a per share minimum closing bid price requirement  pursuant to which our common stock could be de listed from the nasdaq national market if its closing bid price is for consecutive trading days and does not subsequently trade above for consecutive trading days 
there can be no assurance that our closing bid price will be above the nasdaq stock market requirements for the necessary time periods mandated by the nasdaq national market 
if we are unable to meet the nasdaq requirements to maintain listing on the nasdaq national market our common stock could trade on the nasdaq smallcap market  the otc bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets  and our stock price  as well as the liquidity of our common stock  will be adversely impacted as a result 
our ability to achieve our business goals is substantially dependent on our access to sufficient capital 
if we do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations  we may be forced to discontinue product development  reduce our sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities  and we may lose the ability to respond to competitive pressures 
it is possible we may need to raise additional funds in the future  and this additional financing may not be available to us in favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or 
table of contents obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we issue debt securities to raise funds  we may incur significant interest expense  which would harm our profitability 
the issuance of debt securities may also require us to agree to various restrictions typical of debt securities  including limitations on further borrowing and our right to pay dividends 
northrop grumman and our officers and directors control a large percentage of our common stock and together are able to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of march   directors and holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
of this percentage  northrop grumman alone beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  our executive officers  directors and five percent stockholders as a group are able to effectively control all matters requiring approval of our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
northrop grumman alone is able to significantly influence matters on which the stockholders vote 
this concentration of ownership may also delay  deter or prevent a change in control and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without the support of these stockholders  even if the transaction is favorable to our stockholders 
in addition  because of their ownership of our common stock  these stockholders are in a position to significantly affect our corporate actions in a manner that could conflict with the interests of our public stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and arrangements with executive officers contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
we are subject to certain delaware anti takeover laws by virtue of our status as a delaware corporation 
these laws prevent us from engaging in a merger or sale of more than of our assets with any stockholder  including all affiliates and associates of any stockholder  who owns or more of our outstanding voting stock  for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired or more of our voting stock unless the board of directors approved the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  or upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  the interested stockholder owned at least of our voting stock of the corporation  or the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized by least of our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder 
a corporation may opt out of the delaware anti takeover laws in its charter documents  however we have not chosen to do so 
additionally  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control of management  including a staggered board of directors  the elimination of the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent  discretionary authority given to our board of directors as to the issuance of preferred stock  and indemnification rights for our directors and executive officers 
in addition  we have an officer retention plan that provides for the acceleration of vesting of a percentage of the stock options granted to our officers under certain conditions 
under this plan  an unvested portion of each officer s stock options will become vested and  in addition  severance benefits will be paid to the officer  if we undergo a change in control transaction or the officer is terminated without cause 
this plan may make us a less attractive acquisition target or may reduce the amount a potential acquirer may otherwise be willing to pay for our company
