item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations those statements in this section that are not historical in nature should be deemed forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements 
business strategy and overview our strategy is to create a geographically focused  value added refining and marketing business that has i economies of scale  ii a low cost structure  iii superior management information systems and iv outstanding employees focused on operational excellence and that seeks to provide stockholders with competitive returns in any economic environment 
beginning in  we entered into a series of acquisitions and strategic initiatives that transformed our competitive position  the composition and geographical focus of our assets and our financial and operating results 
we expanded our refining capacity from  bpd to  bpd through the acquisition of our hawaii and washington refineries in  our north dakota and utah refineries in and our california refinery in to focus on our refining and marketing business  we sold our oil and gas exploration and production assets in and our marine services assets in december in  we achieved the following significant results  which are further described below under results of operations and capital resources and liquidity increased net earnings by million to million in  compared to a net loss of million in  reflecting improved refined product margins  together with a full year of operations from our california refinery  which we acquired in may increased cash flows from operations by million to million from million in  also reflecting the improved product margins and a full year of california refinery operations 
achieved our million debt reduction goal set in june  reducing our debt to capitalization ratio to at year end  compared to at the end of replaced our former senior secured credit agreement with a new agreement that provides more financing flexibility  lower interest rates and the ability to accelerate debt reduction 
reduced capital and refinery turnaround spending by million to million in  compared to million in  while maintaining environmental  safety  and regulatory and operational requirements 
continued to rationalize our asset base by selling certain non core and under performing assets 
for  our goals are focused on improving profitability from operations by achieving greater operating efficiencies  using increased cash flows from operations to further reduce debt and interest expense  and using capital and turnaround spending to meet epa clean air act standards and maintain safe  reliable operations 
we believe that the improved industry conditions in should continue into factors that should positively impact industry margins in include heavy scheduled industry turnaround activity in the western padd v region  improved economic fundamentals in the us and the far east  and tighter product specifications  including changes in gasoline specifications and the elimination of the mtbe oxygenate in california 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund our operations  capital spending and debt service requirements 
our earnings and cash flows 
table of contents from operations depend upon many factors  including the production and sale of refined products at margins above fixed and variable expenses 
the prices of crude oil and refined products have fluctuated substantially in our markets 
our operating results can be significantly influenced by the timing of changes in crude oil costs and how quickly refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes 
these price fluctuations depend on numerous factors beyond our control  including the demand for crude oil  gasoline and other refined products  which is subject to  among other things  changes in the economy and the level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined products  worldwide political conditions  threatened or actual terrorist incidents or acts of war  availability of crude oil and refined product imports  the infrastructure to transport crude oil and refined products  weather conditions  earthquakes and other natural disasters  seasonal variations  government regulations and local factors  including market conditions and the level of operations of other refineries in our markets 
as a result of these factors  margin fluctuations during any reporting period can have a significant impact on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
results of operations summary our net earnings for were million per basic share and per diluted share  compared with a net loss of million per basic and diluted share for the net earnings for were primarily the result of improved product margins and the full year contribution at our california refinery operations 
net earnings for included the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million aftertax  or per share 
our results also included losses on the sale of our marine services assets and certain retail asset impairments of million aftertax  or per share  voluntary early retirement benefits and severance costs of million aftertax  or per share  and a charge related to the termination of our funded executive security plan of million aftertax  or per share 
in  charges for bridge financing fees  associated with the acquisition of the california refinery  totaled million aftertax  or per share 
our results also included losses on asset sales and impairment of goodwill  which totaled million aftertax  or per share  and severance and integration costs of million aftertax  or per share 
in  our income tax refund claims reduced previously recognized income tax credits by million  or per share  and a lifo inventory liquidation resulted in decreased costs of sales of million aftertax  or per share 
our net loss for the year was million per basic and diluted share compared with net earnings of million per basic share and per diluted share for the net loss for was primarily the result of weak margins in each of our operating segments and additional interest and financing costs related to acquisitions in the second half of and in may in  we incurred approximately million aftertax  or per share  for financing fees and integration costs  primarily associated with the acquisition of our mid continent refineries 
a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance

b in  the washington and california refineries experienced reduced throughput during planned major maintenance turnarounds 
in  throughput was reduced at each of the alaska  north dakota and utah refineries during planned major maintenance turnarounds 
c volumes and margins for include amounts for the california operations since acquisition on may   averaged over days 
throughput and yield for the california refinery averaged over the days of operation were thousand bpd and thousand bpd  respectively 
volumes and margins for include amounts for the mid continent refineries since acquisition on september  averaged over days 
throughput and yield for the mid continent refineries averaged over the days of operation were thousand bpd and thousand bpd  respectively 
d we define heavy crude oil as alaska north slope or crude oil with an american petroleum institute specific gravity of or less 
heavy crude oil throughput increased in compared to  primarily reflecting the additional throughput from the california refinery since its acquisition on may   and completion of our heavy oil conversion project at our washington refinery in march e management uses gross refining margin per barrel to compare profitability to other companies in the industry 
gross refining margin per barrel is calculated by dividing gross refining margin by total refining throughput and may not be calculated similarly by other companies 
management uses manufacturing costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refinery operations 
manufacturing costs per barrel may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
f gross refining margin is calculated as revenues less costs of feedstocks  purchased products  transportation and distribution 
gross refining margin approximates total refining segment throughput times gross refining margin per barrel  adjusted for changes in refined product inventory due to selling a volume and mix of product that is different than actual volumes manufactured 
gross refining margin also includes the effect of intersegment sales to the retail segment at prices which approximate market 
in addition  
table of contents during  certain inventory quantities were reduced resulting in the liquidation of applicable lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs 
this reduction in lifo inventory decreased costs of sales by approximately million and decreased our net loss by million in g includes manufacturing depreciation and amortization per throughput barrel of approximately  and for  and  respectively 
h sources of total product sales included products manufactured at the refineries and products purchased from third parties 
total product sales margin included margins on sales of manufactured and purchased products and the effects of inventory changes 
compared to operating income from our refining segment was million in compared to million in our results for included a complete year of operating income from the california refinery acquired in mid may the california operations contributed approximately million to our refining operating income during compared to approximately million during our total gross refining margin increased from million per barrel in to billion per barrel in  reflecting higher per barrel refining margins in all of our regions and additional throughput volumes from the california refinery  which added an additional thousand bpd to our total refining throughput in compared to furthermore  us west coast gasoline supplies tightened partially due to changes in gasoline specifications related to the phase out of mtbe in california 
gross margins per barrel in our pacific northwest and mid continent regions increased and  respectively 
our pacific northwest margins also improved compared to when  during the first quarter  the washington refinery was in a major maintenance turnaround and its heavy oil conversion project was being completed 
while gross margins in our mid pacific region increased  they remained depressed as compared to our other regions 
industry margins on a national basis remained volatile during  however  they improved compared to  primarily due to increased demand and below average inventory levels for finished products 
the cold winter in increased demand and margins for distillates during the first quarter 
also  maintenance and operating problems at several other refineries in the industry reduced overall industry finished product inventory levels in overall  industry margins during in our market areas averaged slightly above our five year average january  through december  
we determine our five year average by comparing gasoline  diesel and jet fuel prices to crude oil prices in our market areas  with volumes weighted according to our typical refinery yields  excluding heavy fuel oils 
during  the refining industry in our market areas experienced the lowest refined product margins since margins were lower in all of our refining regions for the fourth quarter of  compared to the third quarter  due to low seasonal demand for refined products and rapidly rising crude oil prices 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in  from billion in  due to increased sales volumes from the california refinery and higher product sales prices 
total product sales averaged thousand bpd in  as compared to thousand bpd in  and average product prices increased to per barrel 
costs of sales also increased due to the additional volumes from the california refinery and higher average prices for refinery feedstocks and purchased product supplies compared with expenses  excluding depreciation  increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional operating expenses of approximately million from the california refinery and increased costs for utilities  revenue based taxes and performance bonus expense 
depreciation and amortization increased to million  primarily due to inclusion of the california refinery for the full year 
refinery throughput and yields in will be affected by a major maintenance turnaround of certain units at the california refinery in the fourth quarter 
we currently expect total refinery throughput to average approximately thousand bpd in 
table of contents compared to operating income from our refining segment decreased by million to million in  compared to million in our results for and included amounts from acquired operations since the dates of acquisition 
we acquired the mid continent operations in september and the california refinery in mid may the acquired california operations contributed approximately million to our refining operating income during operating income for the mid continent operations increased to million in from million in due to the full year of operation  largely offset by weaker refined product margins 
the million decrease in our operating income was primarily due to weak refined product margins in margins began to decline in the fourth quarter of and remained low throughout our total gross refining margins averaged per barrel  a decrease from  reflecting lower margins in all of our comparable regions  partly offset by california s additional margin contribution in the gross margins on a per barrel basis in our pacific northwest  mid pacific and mid continent regions declined  and  respectively  compared to industry margins declined primarily due to above average inventory levels for finished products  rising crude oil prices and increased competition from product imports 
the industry experienced rapidly rising crude oil prices due to tensions with iraq during and political instability in venezuela during the fourth quarter 
reduced jet fuel demand and weak economic conditions in the united states and abroad impacted overall industry inventory levels and margins for distillates 
gasoline demand remained strong during and trended higher than the level 
the increased demand  however  was met with high industry gasoline production levels and increased competition from product imports 
our margins were also negatively impacted by the tightening of the price differential between heavy crude oil and light crude oil 
this primarily affected our pacific northwest and california regions where the washington and california refineries are designed to increase earnings by converting heavier  usually less expensive crude oils into higher value products 
our operating income in was also impacted negatively by the scheduled turnarounds at our washington and california refineries in the first and second quarters of  respectively  and unscheduled downtime at our washington and utah refineries in the first quarter of on an aggregate basis  our total gross refining margin increased from to million in  reflecting additional volumes from the mid continent and california refineries  which added thousand bpd to our total refining throughput in compared to throughput rates were reduced by at our other refineries to thousand bpd in from thousand bpd in in response to the weak margin environment in revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in  from billion in  due to additional sales volumes from the mid continent and california refineries  partly offset by lower average product sales prices 
total product sales averaged thousand bpd in  an increase of from  while average product prices dropped to per barrel 
the increase in other revenues was primarily due to higher crude oil resales which totaled million in compared to million in costs of sales also increased primarily due to the additional throughput volumes from the mid continent and california refineries 
expenses  excluding depreciation  increased to million in  primarily due to additional expenses of approximately million from the mid continent and california refineries 
excluding these new operations  total expenses did not change significantly from depreciation and amortization increased to million  primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization of million from the mid continent and california refineries

b management uses fuel margin per gallon calculations to compare profitability in the industry 
fuel margin per gallon is calculated by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes 
fuel margin per gallon may not be calculated similarly by other companies 
c includes the effect of intersegment purchases from our refining segment at prices which approximate market 
compared to operating income for our retail segment improved by million to million in  compared to an operating loss of million in total gross margins were million in compared to million in reflecting higher fuel margin per gallon  largely offset by lower sales volume 
fuel margin increased to per gallon in from per gallon in  reflecting increased demand  lower inventories and our efforts to improve operations 
total gallons sold decreased to million  reflecting the decrease in average station count to in from in the decrease primarily was due to selling company operated stations in december acquired with the california refinery in mid may and the fact that bp amoco branded independent jobber dealer stations included in the acquisition of the mid continent refining and retail assets did not rebrand to the tesoro brand 

table of contents revenues on fuel sales decreased to million in  from million in  reflecting lower sales volumes from fewer stations  partly offset by increased sales prices 
costs of sales also decreased in due to lower sales volumes  partly offset by higher prices of purchased fuel 
the decrease in operating  selling  general and administrative expenses to million in from million in reflects our initiatives to reduce expenses and the decrease in average station count 
depreciation increased to million in  compared to million in  reflecting the placement of new assets into service in and accelerated depreciation for certain assets written off during compared to the operating loss for our retail segment was million in compared to operating income of million in total gross margins increased to million in from million in  reflecting increased sales volume  offset largely by lower fuel margin per gallon 
fuel margin decreased to per gallon in from per gallon in  reflecting continued competitive price pressures and changes in the geographic mix of our retail sites 
total gallons sold increased to million  reflecting the increase in average station count to in from in  primarily due to the mid continent operations acquired in september  additional stations acquired in the pacific northwest in november  and retail stations acquired with the california refinery assets in may as a part of our debt reduction initiative  we sold the california stations in december  which contributed approximately million to operating income during the period we owned them in revenues on fuel sales increased to million in  from million in  while merchandise and other revenues increased by to million 
merchandise margin decreased  however  as a percent of sales  reflecting changes in the mix of merchandise offerings 
with our increased number of stations  expenses increased to million and depreciation increased to million in marine services in december  we sold substantially all of the physical assets of marine services for million  including inventories  and we recognized a pretax loss on the sale of million 
proceeds from the sale were used for general corporate purposes 
marine services operations had become increasingly immaterial  as compared to our primary refining and retail operations  and we believe that the sale of marine services assets is not significant to the historical or ongoing analysis or comparability of our primary operating results or financial position 
operating income increased to million during  reflecting higher sales volume and margins  and lower operating expenses 
in  operating income decreased to million from million in primarily due to lower sales volumes and service revenues 
these operations depended largely on the volume of oil and gas drilling  workover  construction and seismic activity in the gulf of mexico 
see note e in our consolidated financial statements in item for summarized financial information related to marine services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased from million in the increase was due to charges totaling million for voluntary early retirement benefits  severance costs and the termination of our funded executive security plan 
excluding these charges  we reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million  through our cost reduction initiatives 
this reduction in expense was net of employees performance bonuses in  while no bonuses were awarded in as discussed above  our refining and retail segment expenses decreased as a result of our focus on cost reduction initiatives during selling  general and administrative expenses of million in increased from million in the increase was due partially to higher expenses in the refining and retail segments associated with the purchases of refinery and marketing assets in the last half of and may corporate expenses accounted for million of the increase during  resulting from higher acquisition and integration costs  employee costs and professional fees 

table of contents loss on asset sales and impairments the loss on asset sales and impairments of million in consisted primarily of the loss on the sale of marine services of million  the write off of certain refinery assets that were replaced  and the impairment of certain retail assets 
during  the loss on asset sales and impairments of million consisted primarily of losses on the sale of retail stations and an impairment of retail goodwill 
see notes d and k in our consolidated financial statements in item interest and financing costs interest and financing costs were million in compared to million in the increase was due primarily to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs in connection with the replacement of our previous credit facility and voluntary prepayments of other debt  as well as interest on additional debt that we incurred in may to finance the acquisition of our california refinery 
interest and financing costs were million in compared to million in the increase was due primarily to the additional debt we incurred in and in connection with our acquisitions of the mid continent and california operations 
we also expensed million in related to bridge and other financing fees for the acquisition of the california refinery 
income tax provision benefit the income tax provision amounted to million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in the provision reflects pretax earnings for  while the benefit reflects the pretax loss for the income tax provision of million in l reflects pretax earnings in that year at a slightly higher combined effective income tax rate 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
in  we elected to carry back net operating losses to recover income taxes paid in previous years  however  the refund of those taxes resulted in the loss of certain tax credits 
the expiration of these credits  along with other adjustments to our estimated liabilities  resulted in a reduced tax benefit of approximately million in capital resources and liquidity overview we operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum products  availability of trade credit  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these risks include  among others  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  worldwide political conditions and overall market and economic conditions 
see business strategy and overview on page  forward looking statements on page and risk factors on page for further information related to risks and other factors 
our future capital expenditures  as well as borrowings under our credit agreement and other sources of capital  will be affected by these conditions 
nevertheless  we believe that our cash flows from operations and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund our operations  capital spending and debt service requirements 
we recovered income tax refunds in and  and due to net operating loss carry forwards  we expect to pay no more than a minimum amount of federal income taxes in our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  no borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and million in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement after million in outstanding letters of credit 
during  we reduced total debt by million primarily through voluntary repayments  partly offset by million of debt discount accretion 
as further described below  we replaced our previous credit facility in april  including our related term loans  by entering into a new credit agreement  including a million revolving line of credit  and issuing million in senior secured notes and million in floating rate senior secured term loans 

table of contents under our new credit agreement  we used the increased letter of credit capacity to replace early payments and prepayments on crude and product purchases 
we had million in letters of credit outstanding at the end of compared to million at march  prior to entering into our new credit agreement  prepayments and early payments had increased to approximately million at march   compared to prepayments of million at december  capitalization on april   tesoro replaced its billion senior secured credit facility with a new credit agreement  senior secured term loans and senior secured notes due we expensed million of unamortized debt issuance costs in  in connection with the extinguishment of the prior credit facility and voluntary prepayments of other debt  including the voluntary prepayment of the million term loan  described below under credit agreement 
our capital structure at december  was comprised of in millions debt  including current maturities credit agreement revolving credit facility senior secured term loans due senior secured notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due junior subordinated notes due capital lease obligations and other total debt stockholders equity total capitalization at december   our debt to capitalization ratio was  compared to at year end  primarily reflecting total debt repayments of million and net earnings of million during in  we intend to further reduce debt through expected improvements in earnings and cash flows from operations 
our new credit agreement  senior secured term loans and the senior notes impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could potentially limit our ability to respond to market conditions  raise additional debt or equity capital  or take advantage of business opportunities 
credit agreement on april   tesoro entered into a new credit agreement  including a million revolving credit facility maturing in june and a million term loan maturing in april the credit agreement  together with the net proceeds of the million senior secured term loans and million of senior secured notes discussed below  replaced our prior credit facility 
in addition  million of the proceeds were used to repurchase senior subordinated notes 
we voluntarily prepaid the million term loan in the credit agreement currently provides for borrowings including letters of credit up to the lesser of million or the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base million as of december   consisting of tesoro s eligible cash and cash equivalents  receivables and petroleum inventories  as defined 
as of december   we had no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility  resulting in total unused credit availability of million  or of the eligible borrowing base 

table of contents the credit agreement contains covenants and conditions that  among other things  limit our ability to pay cash dividends  incur indebtedness  create liens and make investments 
tesoro is also required to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth 
beginning with the quarter ending march   we will not be required to maintain the fixed charge coverage ratio if unused credit availability exceeds of the eligible borrowing base 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of tesoro s active subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of tesoro s cash and cash equivalents  petroleum inventories and receivables 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at either a base rate at december  or a eurodollar rate ranging from to at december   plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margins at december  for the revolving credit facility were in the case of the base rate and in the case of the eurodollar rate 
letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility incur fees at an annual rate equal to the eurodollar rate applicable margin for the revolving credit facility 
the applicable margins under the revolving credit facility vary based on credit availability levels 
in january  the revolving credit facility eurodollar rate applicable margin was reduced from to  based on the fourth quarter credit availability levels 
senior secured term loans on april   we entered into new million senior secured term loans due april  the term loans are subject to optional redemption by tesoro beginning april  at premiums of through april   from april  to april   and at par thereafter 
the term loans contain covenants and restrictions that are less restrictive than those in the credit agreement

the applicable margins for the term loans were in the case of the base rate and in the case of the eurodollar rate at december  senior secured notes due on april   tesoro issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due april  through a private offering 
on july   we completed an exchange of substantially all of the outstanding notes for senior secured notes due that had been registered under the securities act of the notes have a five year maturity with no sinking fund requirements and are subject to optional redemption by tesoro  beginning april   at a premium of through april   and at par thereafter 
we have the right to redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount at a redemption price of with proceeds from certain equity issuances through april  the indenture for the notes contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for notes of this nature and are similar to the covenants in the indentures for tesoro s senior subordinated notes 
the notes and the term loans are equally secured by substantially all of tesoro s refining property  plant and equipment and are guaranteed by substantially all of tesoro s active subsidiaries

the indentures also limit our subsidiaries ability to create restrictions on making certain payments and distributions 
the senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our active domestic subsidiaries 
junior subordinated notes due in connection with our acquisition of the california refinery  we issued to the seller two ten year junior subordinated notes with face amounts aggregating million 
the notes consist of i a million junior subordinated note  due july  which is non interest bearing through may  and carries a interest rate thereafter  and ii a million junior subordinated note  due july  which bears interest at from may  through may  and thereafter 
the junior subordinated notes were recorded initially at a combined present value of approximately million  discounted at a rate of and  respectively 
the discount is being amortized over the term of the notes 
cash flow summary components of our cash flows are set forth below in millions cash flows from used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash from operating activities during totaled million  compared to million from operating activities in the increase was primarily due to improved earnings before depreciation and amortization  the collection of income tax refunds and lower working capital requirements 
net cash used in 
table of contents investing activities of million in was primarily for capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from the sale of marine services assets 
net cash used in financing activities of million in was primarily for voluntary debt prepayments under the term loan  other debt repayments  and financing costs related to the new credit agreement 
gross borrowings and repayments under revolving credit lines amounted to billion during working capital totaled million at december  compared to million at december   reflecting an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  partly offset by decreases in the current maturities of debt and income taxes receivable 
the increase in our accounts payable reflects the decrease in early payments and prepayments on crude oil and product purchases as a result of our increased use of letters of credit 
net cash from operating activities during totaled million  compared to million from operating activities in the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings before depreciation and amortization and higher expenditures for scheduled refinery turnarounds  partially offset by reduced working capital requirements and income tax refunds 
net cash used in investing activities of million in included million for the acquisition of the california refinery and million for capital expenditures  partially offset by million in proceeds from asset sales 
net cash from financing activities of million in included net proceeds of million from our equity offering  net proceeds of million from our notes offering and borrowings of million under our previous senior secured credit facility  partly offset by repayments of debt of million and financing costs of million 
gross borrowings and repayments under revolving credit lines amounted to million during working capital totaled million at december  compared to million at year end  reflecting increases related to the acquisition of the california refinery  cash and income taxes receivable  partly offset by reductions in inventories 
net cash from operating activities during totaled million  including the results from our mid continent operations acquired in september net cash used in investing activities of million in included million for acquisitions and million for capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds from asset sales 
net cash from financing activities of million in included net borrowings of million under our previous senior secured credit facility and net proceeds of million from our notes offering  partly offset by financing costs of million and preferred dividend payments of million 
the preferred stock was converted to common stock in july  eliminating the preferred dividend requirement 
gross borrowings and repayments under revolving credit lines and interim facilities amounted to million during historical ebitda ebitda represents earnings before interest and financing costs  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization 
we present ebitda because we believe investors use ebitda to help analyze our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to use cash for other purposes  including capital expenditures 
ebitda is also used for internal analysis and as a component of the fixed charge coverage financial covenant in our new credit agreement 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings loss  earnings loss before income taxes  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities 
our annual historical ebitda was in millions net earnings loss add income tax provision benefit add interest and financing costs  net operating income loss add depreciation and amortization ebitda 
table of contents historical ebitda as presented above differs from ebitda as defined under our credit agreement 
the primary differences are non cash postretirement benefit costs and loss on asset sales and impairments  which are added to net earnings loss under the credit agreement ebitda calculations 
capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending our capital expenditures and refinery turnaround spending totaled million during  compared to million in as discussed below 
capital expenditures we revised our capital spending plan in response to the weaker refining and retail margin environment experienced in we reduced or deferred our spending plans for certain discretionary projects while maintaining spending to meet environmental  safety  regulatory and other operational requirements 
the reduced capital plan primarily related to the deferral of discretionary economic refinery projects and minimal spending for retail projects  while spending included million for the california refinery carb iii project  million for the completion of the heavy oil project at our washington refinery and million for developing retail operations 
our total spending  relating to environmental  safety  regulatory and turnarounds  remained comparable to amounts expended during during  our capital expenditures excluding refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs  totaled million  which included million for completion of the fcc riser project at the north dakota refinery  million for the completion of the carb iii project at our california refinery and million for clean air and mact ii environmental projects 
other capital spending was primarily for various refinery improvements and other environmental requirements 
we expect our capital expenditures to approximate million to million in excluding refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs of approximately million 
the capital budget for the refining segment is million  including million for control systems modernization at the california refinery  million for clean air and clean fuel projects including million for a wet gas scrubber project at the north dakota refinery  and other projects totaling million 
our retail capital budget is million for we expect to fund the capital spending program from operating cash flows 
refinery turnaround and other major maintenance during  we spent million for refinery maintenance turnaround  including million for our scheduled turnaround of certain processing units at our utah refinery in the first quarter of  million for the completion of a scheduled turnaround of the alaska refinery in the second quarter of and million for the completion of a scheduled turnaround at the north dakota refinery during september october amortization of refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs totaled million in we expect to spend approximately million in  primarily for a major turnaround at our california refinery 
amortization of refinery turnaround and other major maintenance costs will total approximately million in we estimate our annual spending for refinery maintenance turnarounds to be as follows in millions actual refinery california washington alaska hawaii north dakota utah total

table of contents environmental extensive federal and local environmental laws and regulations govern our operations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications or changes in use for certain emission sources 
environmental remediation liabilities we are currently involved in remedial responses and have incurred and expect to continue to incur cleanup expenditures associated with environmental matters at a number of sites  including certain of our own properties 
at december   our accruals for environmental expenses totaled approximately million 
our accruals for environmental expenses include retained liabilities for previously owned or operated properties  refining  pipeline  terminal and marine services operations and retail service stations 
based on currently available information  including the participation of other parties or former owners in remediation actions  we believe these accruals are adequate 
soil and groundwater conditions at our california refinery may require substantial expenditures over time 
in connection with our acquisition of the california refinery from ultramar  inc in may  ultramar assigned certain of its rights and obligations that ultramar had acquired from tosco corporation in august of tosco assumed responsibility and indemnified us for up to million for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to august of pre acquisition operations 
based on existing information  we currently estimate that the environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations are approximately million  including soil and groundwater conditions at the refinery in connection with various projects and including those required by the california regional water quality control board and other government agencies 
if we incur remediation liabilities in excess of the environmental liabilities for pre acquisition operations indemnified by tosco  we expect to be reimbursed for such excess liabilities under certain environmental insurance policies 
the policies provide million of coverage in excess of the million indemnity covering environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
in december  we initiated arbitration proceedings against tosco seeking damages  indemnity and a declaration that tosco is responsible for the environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations at our california refinery 
in november  we filed suit in contra costa county superior court against tosco alleging that tosco misrepresented  concealed and failed to disclose certain additional environmental conditions at our california refinery 
on march   the court granted tosco s motion to compel arbitration of our claims for these certain additional environmental conditions 
in the arbitration proceedings we initiated against tosco in december  we are also seeking a determination that tosco is liable for investigation and remediation of these certain additional environmental conditions  the amount of which is unknown at this time and which may not be covered by the million indemnity for environmental liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
in response to our arbitration claims  tosco filed counterclaims in the contra cost superior court action alleging that we are contractually responsible for certain environmental liabilities at our california refinery  including certain liabilities arising from pre acquisition operations 
we intend to vigorously prosecute our claims against tosco and to oppose tosco s claims against us  although we cannot provide assurance that we will prevail 
environmental capital epa regulations related to the clean air act require a reduction in the sulfur content in gasoline beginning january  to meet the revised gasoline standard  we currently estimate we will make capital improvements of approximately million through and an additional million beyond this will permit each of our six refineries to produce gasoline meeting the sulfur limits imposed by the epa 
epa regulations related to the clean air act also require a reduction in the sulfur content in diesel fuel manufactured for on road consumption 
in general  the new diesel fuel standards will become effective on june  based on the latest engineering estimates and spending to date  we expect to spend 
table of contents approximately million in capital improvements through  which does not include the potential impact of the recent epa proposed rule for the sulfur content off off road diesel fuel 
we expect to spend approximately million in capital improvements through to comply with the refinery mact ii regulations 
these regulations require new emission controls at certain processing units at our refineries  including approximately million at the north dakota refinery and million at the washington refinery 
estimated capital expenditures described above to comply with the clean air act are summarized in the table below in millions 
beyond actual lower sulfur gasoline alaska hawaii washington north dakota utah california total for lower sulfur gasoline lower sulfur diesel alaska hawaii washington north dakota utah california total for lower sulfur diesel refinery mact ii california carb iii gasoline total in connection with the acquisition of the north dakota and utah refineries  we assumed the sellers obligations and liabilities under a consent decree among the united states  bp exploration and oil co  amoco oil company and atlantic richfield company 
bp entered into this consent decree for both the north dakota and utah refineries for various alleged violations 
as the owner of these refineries  we are required to address issues  including leak detection and repair  flaring protection and sulfur recovery unit optimization 
we currently estimate that we will spend million to comply with this consent decree in addition to estimated expenditures of million in for the installation of new emission control equipment at the north dakota refinery to meet mact ii regulations described above 
we also agreed to indemnify the sellers for all losses of any kind incurred in connection with the consent decree 
in connection with the acquisition of the california refinery  subject to certain conditions  we assumed the seller s obligations pursuant to its settlement efforts with the epa concerning the section refinery enforcement initiative under the clean air act  except for any potential monetary penalties  which the seller retains 
we believe these obligations will not have a material impact on our financial position 
we will need to expend additional capital at the california refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above ground storage tank systems and upgrading piping within the refinery 
we estimate that we may spend up to million through this cost estimate is subject to further review and analysis 

table of contents conditions may develop that cause increases or decreases in future expenditures for our various sites  including  but not limited to  our refineries  tank farms  retail gasoline stations operating and closed locations and petroleum product terminals  and for compliance with the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements 
we cannot currently determine the amounts of these future expenditures

during  we terminated the funded executive security plan resulting in a write off of unamortized prepaid pension costs of million and a plan curtailment contribution of million 
our long term expected return on plan assets is  and our pension plan assets experienced a return of million in and a loss of million in we contributed million in and expect to contribute million in and million in to these plans 
our expected contributions are affected by returns on plan assets  employee demographics and other factors

claims against third parties beginning in the early s  tesoro hawaii corporation  tesoro alaska company and other fuel suppliers entered a series of long term  fixed price fuel supply contracts with the us defense energy support center desc 
each of the contracts contained an adjustable price that permitted the desc to adjust prices 
however  the federal acquisition regulations far limits how prices may be adjusted 
tesoro and many of the other suppliers in separate suits in the court of federal claims currently are seeking relief from the desc s price adjustments 
tesoro and the other suppliers allege that the desc s price adjustments violated far by not adjusting the price of fuel based on changes to the suppliers established prices or costs  as far requires 
tesoro and the other suppliers seek recovery of over billion in underpayment for fuel 
tesoro s share of the underpayment currently totals approximately million although approximately million of this amount is still pending at the administrative claims level 
the desc responded to tesoro s and the other suppliers claims by moving for partial summary judgment 
in response  tesoro and the other suppliers cross moved for partial summary judgment 
the court of federal claims granted partial summary judgment for tesoro  held that the desc s fuel prices were illegal  and rejected the desc s assertion that tesoro waived its right to a remedy by entering the contracts 
however  some of the other judges in the same court ruled on the cross motions for other suppliers in conflict with the holding for tesoro 
as a result  tesoro petitioned the court of appeals for the federal circuit to review its claims 
tesoro is seeking the court of appeals validation that the price adjustments were illegal and tesoro did not waive its right to sue when it entered the contracts 
tesoro expects the appeal process to take approximately nine months and for the court to issue its decision by the end of  but we cannot predict the outcome of our claims against the desc 
in december of  tesoro alaska company filed a protest of the intrastate rates charged for the transportation of its crude oil through the trans alaska pipeline company 
tesoro s protest asserted that the taps intrastate rates were excessive and should be reduced 
the regulatory commission of alaska rca opened rca docket no 
p to consider tesoro s protest of the intrastate rates for the years through through rca s order p  the rca set just and reasonable final rates for the years through  and held that tesoro is entitled to receive approximately million in refunds  including interest calculated as of december  rca order p is currently on appeal  and we cannot give any assurances of when or whether we will prevail in the appeal
