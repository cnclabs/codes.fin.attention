net sales revenue consolidated net sales revenue for the year ended december   was million compared to million in  a decrease of approximately percent 
net sales revenue decreased approximately percent in compared to million in during and  the decrease in net sales revenue is primarily due to decreased net sales revenue in the united states as well as several international markets experiencing declining net sales revenue as a result of import restrictions  political unrest and currency devaluation 
we distribute our products to consumers through an independent sales force comprised of managers and distributors 
active managers totaled approximately   and  at december   and  respectively 
active distributors totaled approximately   and  at december   and  respectively 
we anticipate the number of active distributors to increase as we expand our existing operations  enter new international markets and as current distributors grow their businesses 
net sales revenue related to the united states operations decreased approximately percent in to million compared to million in net sales revenue increased slightly for  compared to million in price increases of percent in our united states market went into effect in both and a price increase of approximately percent  primarily associated with increased raw material costs  is scheduled to become effective on april  management believes this price increase in its united states market will be acceptable to its sales force and will result in increased net sales revenue 
international net sales revenue decreased to million in compared to million in  a decrease of approximately percent 
net sales revenue decreased approximately percent in compared to million in during and  our operations in south korea and venezuela experienced decreases of approximately million and million  respectively  in net sales revenue over the previous year 
the decrease in south korea was due to increased competition for our distributors 
the decrease in net sales revenue in venezuela is primarily due to political unrest and currency devaluation 
net sales revenue for  and in our operations in brazil was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net sales revenue was due to import regulations imposed by the brazilian government 
we expect these new regulations to continue to adversely impact net sales revenue and operating results during the decrease in international net sales revenue was offset in part by strong net sales increases in the russian federation  israel  and mexico 
price increases are planned in various international markets to compensate for foreign currency devaluations and increases in the cost of finished products 
management believes the price increases will be acceptable to its sales force and will result in increased net sales revenue 
synergy worldwide net sales revenue increased to million in compared to million in  an increase of approximately percent 
net sales revenue decreased approximately percent in compared to million in the increase in net sales revenue in is primarily the result of increased distributor recruiting and marketing efforts in japan and thailand 
the decrease in net sales revenue in as compared to was associated with restructuring of operations and the realignment of marketing strategies associated with synergy worldwide

costs and expenses our costs and expenses  which include cost of goods sold  the commission portion of volume incentives  and selling  general and administrative  are identified as a percent of net sales revenue in the table below year ended december cost of goods sold volume incentives selling  general and administrative cost of goods sold cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales revenue decreased in and as compared to  primarily as a result of decreased importation costs in several of our international operations as well as increased efficiency gained from our expanded manufacturing facility 
management believes that cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales revenue will remain relatively constant during as compared to volume incentives as required by eitf  we reclassified million  million and million in volume incentive rebates as a reduction in revenue for  and  respectively 
as a result  volume incentive expense has been reduced by the same amounts in each year 
there was no impact on operating income  net income  or earnings per basic or diluted common share 
prior to the adoption of eitf  the company included both commission and rebate payments made to our independent distributors and managers in volume incentives in the operating expense section of the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent commission payments made to our independent distributors and managers 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels and for recruiting additional distributors 
volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue increased slightly during as compared to and  primarily as a result of the increased sales revenue in our synergy division where volume incentives are slightly higher than in the united states and our other international operations 
management expects volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue to increase slightly during as compared to due to increased volume incentives in our synergy division where volume incentives are slightly higher 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to an increase of million in and an increase of million in  primarily as a result of expenses incurred to restructure several of our operations and consolidate various employee positions 
approximately million of the increase in is related to cost cutting programs designed to eliminate and consolidate various management and employee positions as well as to realign programs and market strategies 
increased expenses are also associated with incentive and promotional programs in the united states and international operations designed to increase distributor recruitment and increase sales revenue  as well as additional selling  general and administrative expenses associated with synergy  our division involved in the distribution and sale of high quality nutritional  personal care and other products with an emphasis on the asian markets 
during  and  selling  general and administrative expenses associated with synergy totaled million  million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales revenue increased to percent in compared to percent in and percent in this category includes costs for research and development  distribution and incentive programs such as our conventions 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales revenue will decrease during as compared to due to cost control measures  including the impact of the september restructuring instituted in the united states operations 
in our international operations reductions in selling  general and administrative expenses are planned in our south korea  japan and brazil operations 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent in and percent in the decrease in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in certain of the company s international subsidiaries tax provisions and the reduction in valuation allowances against certain of the international subsidiaries deferred tax assets 
we anticipate our effective tax rate to be slightly higher during as compared to product liability similar to other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of our products results in injury 
as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny of products that contain ephedrine alkaloids and kava  we have not been able to obtain product liability insurance covering such products 
effective april   we will comply with the us food and drug administration s ban on the ingredient ephedra 
currently  less than percent of our products contain some amount of ephedrine alkaloids and kava 
we carry insurance in the types and amounts we consider reasonably adequate to cover the risks associated with our business 
on june   we established a wholly owned captive insurance company to provide us with product liability insurance coverage 
we have accrued an amount using the assistance of a third party actuary that we believe is sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based on our history of such claims 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be sufficient nor can there be any assurance that the ultimate outcome of any litigation for product liability will not have a material negative impact on our financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to million in the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in accrued liabilities and volume incentives offset by a reduction in net income 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the high level of capital expenditures in was primarily due to the expansion of the manufacturing  research and development and quality assurance areas of our manufacturing facility 
construction began during the fourth quarter of and was completed during the second quarter of capital expenditures not related to this expansion were primarily for equipment  computer systems and software  office furniture and leasehold improvements made to enhance existing operations as well as the expansion of international markets 
in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
the repurchase of these shares was completed in march on march   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased the full  shares under this authorization 
in connection with these board authorized purchases of  shares  we spent approximately million and million in cash to repurchase common stock in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we entered into an operating line of credit agreement providing for borrowings of up to million 
the proceeds from this line of credit may be used to repurchase common shares of our outstanding stock under board authorized repurchase programs as well as to fund working capital  capital expenditures and related costs 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of million on this line of credit 
proceeds from the line of credit were used to purchase approximately  shares of our stock under board authorized repurchase programs 
as of december   we are in compliance with all financial covenants 
as of february   this line of credit was paid in full 
additional information with respect to this line of credit is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
during  we entered into an exclusive  marketing agreement with healthetech  inc  to make available personal health monitoring devices and personalized diet and nutrition software to our managers and distributors 
as part of this agreement  the company purchased approximately million of healthetech  inc common stock at fair market value 
during the second quarter of  we determined that our investment in healthetech was impaired and that the impairment was other than temporary and accordingly wrote down our investment to quoted market value 
the impairment to this investment was approximately million 
during  our wholly owned subsidiary  innovative botanical solutions  inc  entered into an exclusive agreement with cetalon corporation to manufacture a proprietary line of cetalon branded herbs and vitamins 
additionally  innovative botanical solutions purchased approximately million in cetalon common stock 
a loan of million was also provided to cetalon corporation  and an option obtained for innovative botanical solutions to purchase additional shares of cetalon common stock 
during the first quarter of  we determined that our investments in cetalon were impaired and accordingly wrote off the debt and equity investments 
we have certain commitments related to operating leases as set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we believe that our working capital requirements can be met through our available cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities for the foreseeable future  however  a prolonged economic downturn or a decrease in the demand for our products could adversely affect our long term liquidity 
in the event of a significant decrease in cash provided by our operating activities  we might need to obtain additional external sources of funding 
we currently maintain an operating line of credit allowing for borrowings of up to million of which million has been borrowed as of december  the proceeds from this line of credit may be used to repurchase common shares  as well as to fund working capital requirements 
we do not currently maintain a long term credit facility or any other external sources of long term funding  however  we believe that such funding could be obtained on competitive terms in the event additional sources of funds become necessary 
the following table summarizes information about contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years after years line of credit operating leases total contractual obligations key accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when products are shipped and title passes to our independent distributors 
for most product sales  the sales price is received in the form of cash or credit card payment  which accompanies or precedes the shipment of the product 
sales revenue is recorded net of the rebate portion of volume incentives 
previously we had reported the rebates as part of volume incentives in the operating expense section of the income statement  but as required by eitf  the company has reclassified million and million in rebates as a reduction in revenue for and  respectively 
as a result  volume incentive expense has been reduced by the same amounts in each year 
there was no impact on operating income  net income  or earnings per basic or diluted common share 
further information related to volume incentives is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of the report 
as products are shipped  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a reserve for product returns  which reduces revenue  is accrued based on historical experience 
from time to time  our united states operation extends short term credit associated with product promotions 
for certain of our international operations  we offer credit terms consistent with industry standards within the country of operation 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in accrued liabilities 
volume incentives accrual we accrue for expenses for volume incentives associated with our net sales revenue 
volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent payments made to our independent distributors and managers

self insurance liabilities we self insure for certain employee medical and product liabilities 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims and claims incurred but not reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in actual liabilities being more or less than the amounts currently recorded 
incentive trip accrual we accrue for expenses for incentive trips associated with our direct sales marketing program  which rewards independent distributors and managers with paid attendance at our conventions and meetings 
expenses associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to expand our international operations 
net sales revenue  operating income and net income are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in international operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern international investment in countries where we have operations as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in united states laws and regulations relating to international trade and investment 
foreign currency risk during the year ended december   approximately percent of our net sales revenue and approximately percent of our expenses were realized outside of the united states 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is considered the functional currency  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the periods reported 
therefore  reported sales and expenses will be positively impacted by a weakening of the us dollar and will be negatively impacted by a strengthening of the us dollar 
given the uncertainty of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations or financial condition 
changes in currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging  trading or speculating on foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the following table sets forth average currency exchange rates of one us dollar into local currency for each of the currencies in which sales revenue exceeded million during any of the years presented 
year ended december mexico south korea venezuela during and venezuela experienced a significant devaluation in the bolivar  which adversely affected the results of operations 
continued devaluation could adversely affect the results of operations in future periods 
interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by purchasing investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of marketable securities 
at december   we had investments of million of which million were municipal obligations  which carry an average fixed interest rate of percent and mature over a five year period 
a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our liquidity  financial condition  or results of operations 
our remaining investments of million are not subject to interest rate risk
