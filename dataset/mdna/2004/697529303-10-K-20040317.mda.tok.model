item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are engaged in research  development  manufacturing and distribution of proprietary light based systems for hair removal and other cosmetic treatments 
since our inception  we have been able to develop a differentiated product mix of light based systems for cosmetic treatments through our research and development as well as with our partnerships with massachusetts general hospital s wellman laboratories and other centers throughout the world 
we are continually developing and testing new indications to further the advancement in cosmetic light based hair removal techniques  fat reduction  acne treatment  pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb and skin rejuvenation 
over the past year  we improved product gross margins significantly due to a higher margin product mix and the effects of increased sales volume 
we also strengthened our balance sheet since the end of last year  including more than doubling our cash position and more than tripling stockholders equity 
the current ratio is now x  up substantially from x at the end of  and we have no long term debt 
our reported revenues for the year ended december   were million  up from million for the year ended december  gross profit from product sales increased to million percent of revenues  up from million percent of revenues in the year earlier period 
we also reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   versus net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  over the last two years  most of our revenue has included the lux family of products with their complementary handpieces  offering a suite of applications to the end user at a lower cost than other competing systems 
customers can invest in their first lux system with one handpiece then purchase additional handpieces as their practice grows and upgrade into a more powerful lux systems when ready 
additionally  the lux platform enables palomar to custom tailor products to fit almost any professional medical office or spa location and provides our customers with the comfort that the system can grow with their practice 
we have kept a commitment to continually provide value to customers who invest in our lux system platform 
we believe the lux family of products are the most affordable and versatile cosmetic light based systems on the market 
during  we introduced two new systems to the lux family of products the medilux pulsed light system and the neolux pulsed light system 
the medilux  a higher priced product is designed with the medical practitioner in mind  has more power than that of the estelux pulsed light system  a higher repetition rate and a snap on connector for faster changes between handpieces 
the medilux can operate the luxy  luxg  luxr  luxrs  luxb and luxv handpieces  which allows customers to add additional applications to their treatment portfolio and provide specifically tailored procedures to meet their demand 
the lower priced neolux was developed specifically for the beauty industry 
the neolux is a simple  three setting device that can operate the luxy  luxr and luxrs handpieces 
our quarterly product revenue has increased each quarter during as compared to as a result of the increased product demand for our lux family of products 
due to this increased demand in the market place  we doubled our domestic sales force in the fourth quarter of looking forward  we would expect as our installed base of lux family of products continues to increase that the demand for replacement handpieces will increase resulting in additional product revenue and higher margins 
on february   we entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based hair removal device for women 
we believe that this device will be protected by multiple patents within our patent portfolio 
during  we received from gillette million to fund development 
see note  development and license agreement with gillette and exhibit  the development and license agreement with the gillette company effective february  with redacted exhibits we continue to focus on delivering innovative light based systems and products to our customers in order to drive revenue and earnings growth 
recent developments in february  we introduced the newest addition to the lux family of products the starlux pulsed light and laser system 
in comparison to other lux products  the starlux has increased power  a computer controlled touch screen  instant handpiece recognition  integrated cooling  the ability to operate the luxg  luxr  luxrs  luxv and the lux handpieces 
we expect to start commercial shipment of starlux products in the third quarter of on february   we were awarded a million research contract by the department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
the project is scheduled to last for nineteen months 
critical accounting policies our policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b and sab sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment and acceptance 
provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for any applicable warranty costs expected to be incurred 
revenues from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contract 
revenues from services administered by us that are not covered by a service contract are recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we sell products together with service contracts 
we recognize the revenue element in accordance with sab and eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
royalty revenues are recognized upon receipt of cash payments 
we account for funded product development revenue under the gillette agreement ratably over the funding period as received 
any amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments are not refundable if the development is not successful 
see note  development and license agreement with gillette and exhibit  the development and license agreement with the gillette company effective february  with redacted exhibits accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a a customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  b a customer s current and projected financial condition  c the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and d the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
our level of reserves for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
we provide a general reserve for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  historical experiences of write offs and defaults 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular order  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we perform a detail review of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of the our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of its inventory to its net realizable value 
warranty provision 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty for a period of one year 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
assumptions and historical warranty experience are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis to determine the appropriateness of such assumptions 
warranty cost accruals are adjusted from time to time when warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
income taxes 
we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  we have recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully utilize the nols 
should our assumptions regarding the utilization of these nols change  we may reduce some or all of this valuation allowance  which would result in the recording of an income tax benefit 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
results of operations year compared to year the following table contains selected statement of operations information  which serves as the basis of the discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands  except for percentages change to amount as a of total revenues amount as a of total revenues change change revenues product revenues    royalty revenues   funded product development revenues  total revenues    cost and expenses cost of product revenues   cost of royalty revenues  research development    selling marketing    general administrative    total costs expenses    income loss from operations  interest income interest expense other income income before benefit from income taxes  benefit from income taxes net income    product revenues 
increases in unit sales and the average selling prices of the lux family of products were the leading contributor to the increase in product revenues 
the lux family of products  consisting of the medilux  estelux  neolux and related additional handpieces increased for the year ended in comparison to the same period in product revenues were favorably impacted by an increase of in sales related to the q yag product line offset by a decrease of of sales related to the slp and a decrease of of sales related to the rd product line in comparison to the same period in market acceptance of the lux family of products has been increasing since its introduction in september we have discontinued the rd product line and have begun the process of phasing out the slp product line 
international product revenue  consisting of sales by our distributors in japan  europe  australia  asia pacific rim and south and central america and our sales shipped directly to international customers was of total product revenue for the year ended in comparison to for the same period in this decrease as a percentage of revenues in international sales is directly attributed to the increase in domestic product sales and a decrease in sales to japan 
royalty revenues 
the decrease in royalty revenues in comparison to the same period in is attributed to lumenis inc s lumenis failure to make its royalty payments starting in october see legal proceedings funded product development revenues 
for the year ended  funded product development revenue of million was for work performed in connection with payments made by gillette 
on february   we entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based hair removal device for women 
see note  development and license agreement with gillette and exhibit  the development and license agreement with the gillette company effective february  with redacted exhibits cost of product revenues 
the cost of product revenues decreased as a percentage of product revenue to in from in this cost decreased as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to improved gross profit recognized on the lux family of products as a result of lower manufacturing costs associated with the lux product lines 
in addition  the increased sales volume has improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead at our manufacturing facility for each product line 
in connection with our increased focus on the lux product lines and a de emphasis and discontinuation of certain other existing products  during the fourth quarter of  we wrote off an additional  to cost of product revenues relating to the slp and rd product line 
approximately  was written off in relation to the slp product line for prior generation and obsolete and excess inventory and  was written off in relation to the rd product line for excess inventories 
while we have discontinued the active marketing of certain products  we remain committed to servicing both product lines and will maintain adequate service inventories for each 
during  we experienced unusually high warranty claims for the slp due to issues related to a key component 
accordingly  we increased our warranty reserve by  in the third quarter of bringing the total warranty reserve related to this key component to approximately  during  we qualified a new vendor for the key component and began replacing this key component 
as of year end  we believe that the replacement part had effectively rectified the problem and that the warranty reserve was significantly in excess of estimated requirements 
consequently  we decreased our warranty reserve and reduced cost of goods sold by approximately  in the fourth quarter of cost of royalty revenues 
as a percentage of royalty revenues  the cost of royalty revenues was consistent at for both periods 
the decrease in royalty revenues is attributed to lumenis failure to make its royalty payments resulting in a reduced cost of royalty due to massachusetts general hospital 
see legal proceedings 
research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expense is a direct result of our spending related to the gillette agreement and our continued commitment to introducing new platforms and enhancing our current family of products 
for our research and development agreement with gillette  we have increased our research and clinical staffing by 
this increase in staffing has increased our payroll and payroll related expenses by approximately  in addition to this increase in payroll and payroll related expenses  we have incurred costs of approximately  on materials and consultants for prototypes related to the gillette agreement 
the investment in the lux platform has allowed us to use the same platforms to introduce new applications by developing new handpieces and other complimentary features as opposed to developing new systems for each application 
we continue our development of product platform enhancements and additional platforms 
the spending on research and development reflects the our commitment to continuing dermatology research for a better understanding of various cosmetic and medical conditions and to continuing research and development of devices and delivery systems to better treat those various cosmetic and medical conditions 
the research and development goals in the fields of light based hair removal and pigmented and vascular lesion removal are to design systems that permit effective treatment and more rapid treatment of large areas  have high gross margins  and are manufactured at lower costs  to expand our current markets 
furthermore  we are developing products to address other dermatology and cosmetic conditions  including the fields of fat reduction  acne treatment and skin rejuvenation 
selling and marketing expense 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses is associated with an increase in direct sales force commissions of approximately  an increase in international commissions of approximately  an increase in commissions related to our independent representatives of approximately  and a doubling of our domestic sales force in october these increases directly correlate with our increased revenues  upfront costs associated with both international and domestic sales force and distribution channel expansion as well as costs associated with regional and international trade show and other marketing expenses 
general and administrative expense 
the increase in general and administrative dollars of million is directly related to increases to incentive compensation of approximately  related to our incentive compensation plan of  additional legal expenses of approximately  incurred as a result of enforcing our patent position against infringers and an increase in our d o general liability insurance premiums of approximately  interest income 
interest income remained consistent in and the increase in excess cash to invest in was offset by a reduction in interest rates 
interest expense 
the interest expense decrease is attributable to our reduction of debt 
on march   a director surrendered a million promissory note in exchange for  unregistered shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the price was calculated at of palomar s common stock trailing ten day average closing price of per share 
other income 
other income is attributable to payments received from a previously written off note receivable and equity investment 
benefit for income taxes 
we recognized a benefit for income taxes of  in as result of a  carryback claim pursuant to the economic stimulus package of and a  reduction in deferred income tax accruals associated with certain tax deductions taken in our federal tax return which were no longer required 
offsetting these benefits  we provided a effective tax rate for anticipated federal alternative minimum taxes and minimum state income taxes due for we recorded no tax provision in as we only had  net income for the year and were able to fully offset minimum taxes with net operating loss carryforwards 
we have fully reserved our otherwise recognizable deferred tax asset  as its realization is uncertain 
year compared to year the following table contains selected statement of operations information  which serves as the basis of the discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands  except for percentages change to amount as a of total revenues amount as a of total revenues change change revenues product revenues    royalty revenues    funded product development revenues total revenues    cost and expenses cost of product revenues    cost of royalty revenues    research development    selling marketing    general administrative   total costs expenses   income loss from operations  interest income interest expense other income income loss before benefit from income taxes   benefit from income taxes net income loss   product revenues 
the leading contributor to the increase in product revenues were sales related to the estelux product line and its additional handpieces which had lower price points than palomar s other products 
international product revenue  consisting of sales by our distributors in japan  europe  australia  asia pacific rim and south and central america and sales shipped directly to international customers from the united states was of total product revenue in and royalty revenues 
royalty revenues decreased in as compared to due to lumenis failure to make its royalty payments starting in october see legal proceedings cost of product revenues 
the cost of product revenues decreased as a percentage of product revenues to from in this cost decreased as a percentage of product revenue primarily due to the introduction of the estelux product line  including its additional handpieces that carry an improved gross profit as compared to existing products due to lower manufacturing costs 
in addition  the increased sales volume improved the absorption of manufacturing overhead at our manufacturing facility for each product line 
cost of royalty revenues 
as a percentage of royalty revenues  the cost of royalty revenues was consistent at for both periods 
the decrease in royalty revenues is attributed to lumenis failure to make its royalty payments resulting in a reduced cost of royalty due to massachusetts general hospital 
see legal proceedings research and development expense 
the decreases in both dollars and as a percentage of revenues for research and development expenses were a direct result of the investments that we made in prior periods in the development of product platforms 
these platforms have allowed us to introduce new applications by developing new handpieces and other complimentary features 
the spending on research and development reflects our commitment to continuing dermatology research for a better understanding of various cosmetic and medical conditions and to continuing research and development of devices and delivery systems to better treat those various cosmetic and medical conditions 
the research and development goals in the fields of light based hair removal and pigmented and vascular lesion removal are to design systems that permit effective treatment and more rapid treatment of large areas  have higher gross margins  and are manufactured at lower costs  to expand our current markets 
furthermore  we are developing products to address dermatology and cosmetic conditions other than hair  including the fields of fat reduction  acne treatment and skin rejuvenation 
selling and marketing expense 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses is associated with direct sales force and international commissions of million which are correlated with increased revenues  upfront costs associated with both international and domestic sales force of approximately  and distribution channel expansion and additional marketing expenses of approximately  associated with the roll out of the our new product lines 
general and administrative expense 
the increase in general and administrative dollars of  is directly related to additional legal expenses incurred as a result of enforcing our patent position against infringers 
interest income 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower cash balances invested and lower interest rates in as compared to the same period in interest expense 
the increase in interest expense is due to a higher average debt balance in as a result of the note payable to a related party as compared to other income 
other income is attributable to payments received from a previously written off note receivable and equity investment 
benefit from income taxes 
we have not recorded a provision for income taxes in due to only having  net income and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
the benefit for income taxes in was the result of previously provided state income taxes no longer required 
we have fully reserved our otherwise recognizable deferred tax asset  as its realization is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
the sales of our current products and future products will be critical to our future liquidity 
we believe that cash balances will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
cash provided by operating activities amounted to  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  for the same period in this increase primarily reflects the effects of a net profit offset by working capital requirements primarily accounts receivable associated with our sales growth 
cash used by investing activities totaled  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  for the same period in these amounts primarily reflect cash used for purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the twelve month period ended december  compared to a use of  for the same period in this increase was a result of sales of common stock  and exercises of stock options and purchases of common stock pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan offset by costs related to the issuance of common stock 
we anticipate that capital expenditures for will total approximately  consisting primarily of machinery  equipment  computers and peripherals 
we expect to finance these expenditures with cash on hand 
lumenis stopped making royalty payments due since october  for sales of their lightsheer diode laser system 
on february   we terminated our license agreement with lumenis see legal proceedings 
during the second quarter of  carl zeiss meditec ag  parent company to asclepion meditec ag  notified us that it had sold asclepion to el 
en and quanta system and  consequently  terminated the sub license agreement between asclepion and us effective july  asclepion paid us a minimum royalty payment of fifty thousand dollars  per year  prorated in the first and last years 
we face risks associated with pending litigation and there can be no assurance that these royalty amounts from other third parties will not decrease or that we will be able to collect all licensing royalties owed by current licensees or increase royalties by sub licensing additional third parties 
on february   we entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based  hair removal device for women 
the agreement provides up to million in initial development support funding to be paid by gillette over approximately the first months of the agreement  with million provided during see note  development and license agreement with gillette and exhibit  the development and license agreement with the gillette company effective february  with redacted exhibits on march   a director surrendered the million principal balance of a promissory note in exchange for  unregistered shares of the palomar s common stock with no registration rights at a price of per share 
the price was calculated at of the palomar s common stock trailing ten day average closing price of per share 
on march   we completed a private placement with craig drill capital  a private investment firm based in new york city  for the purchase of million unregistered shares of palomar s common stock at a price of per share for an aggregate subscription price of million 
the price was calculated at of palomar s common stock trailing ten day average closing price of per share 
on february   we announced that we were awarded a million research contract by the department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
the grant will be paid monthly as expenses are incurred 
the project is scheduled to last for nineteen months 
contractual obligations substantially all of our existing operating leases relate to our burlington  massachusetts manufacturing  research and development and administrative offices 
the facility lease expires in august in august  we entered into an agreement with massachusetts general hospital whereby massachusetts general hospital agreed to conduct clinical trials on a laser treatment for hair removal reduction developed at wellman laboratories of photomedicine 
in july  we further amended this agreement to extend its exclusive research agreement for an additional five years 
in addition to laser hair removal  the agreement has been expanded to include research and development in the fields of fat removal and acne treatment 
we have the right to exclusively license  on royalty terms to be negotiated  the palomar funded inventions in the relevant fields 
under the terms of this agreement  we have paid massachusetts general hospital  on an annual basis for clinical research through august we are a party to a license agreement  as amended  with massachusetts general hospital whereby the company is obligated to pay royalties to massachusetts general hospital 
royalty expense in totaled approximately  the following table summarizes our estimated minimum future contractual commitments at december   excluding royalty and employment obligations because they are variable and or subject to uncertain timing in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases    purchase commitments   total contractual cash obligations     recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb the primary objectives of this interpretation are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities and how to determine when and which business enterprise the primary beneficiary should consolidate the variable interest entity 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either i the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest  or ii the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that the primary beneficiary  as well as all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a variable interest entity  make additional disclosures

revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r to address certain fin implementation issues 
the effective dates and impact of fin and fin r are as follows i special purpose entities spes created prior to february  we must apply either the provisions of fin or early adopt the provisions of fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  ii non spes created prior to february  we are required to adopt fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  iii all entities  regardless of whether a spe  that were created subsequent to january  the provisions of fin were applicable for variable interests in entities obtained after january  the company is required to adopt fin r at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after march  the adoption of the provisions applicable to spes and all other variable interests obtained after january  did not have a material impact our financial statements

our actual results could differ materially from those suggested in such forward looking statements due to the risk factors identified below and other factors including  without limitation  risks concerning the timing of new product introductions  financing of future operations  manufacturing risks  variations in our quarterly results  the occurrence of unanticipated events and circumstances  and general economic conditions  including stock market volatility  results of future operations  technological difficulties in developing or introducing new products  the results of future research  lack of product demand and market acceptance for current and future products  challenges in managing joint ventures and research with third parties  the impact of competitive products and pricing  governmental regulations with respect to medical devices  including whether fda clearance will be obtained for future products  the results of litigation  difficulties in collecting royalties  potential infringement of third party intellectual property rights  and or other factors  which are detailed from time to time in palomar s sec reports  including the report on form k for the year ended december  and palomar s quarterly reports on form q 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date hereof 
palomar undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the cautionary statements below are being made pursuant to the provisions of the reform act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of safe harbor provisions of the reform act 
forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future and can be identified by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would or similar words 
cautionary statements our future revenue may decrease if we are unable to successfully develop and market new products 
light based technology is rapidly changing and improving 
in order to be successful  we must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to develop in a timely and cost effective manner new products that meet changing market demands  enhance existing products  and achieve market acceptance for such products 
we have in the past experienced delays in developing and marketing new products and enhancing existing products 
furthermore  some of our new products under development are based on unproven technology and or technology with which we have no previous experience 
in addition  the market for professional hair removal light based devices may already be saturated 
at present  broader market acceptance of light based hair removal is critical to our success and we intend to continue our goals of bringing light based hair removal devices to the mass consumer market 
we also intend to continue to diversify our product line by developing cosmetic light based products for uses other than hair and tattoo removal and treatment of pigmented and vascular lesions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such strategy in a timely fashion or at all and our failure to do so could decrease our future revenue 
our failure to respond to rapid changes in technology could make our products obsolete and we may be unable to compete with companies having superior financial  marketing and other resources 
the light based cosmetic and dermatology industry is highly competitive and companies frequently introduce new products 
we compete in the development  manufacture  marketing  sales and servicing of light based devices with numerous other companies  some of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
our products also face competition from medical products and cosmetic procedures  such as electrolysis and waxing  among others 
we may not be able to differentiate our products from the products of our competitors  and customers may not consider our products to be superior to competing products or procedures  especially if competitive products and procedures are offered at lower prices 
our competitors may develop products or new technologies that make our products obsolete or less competitive 
if forecasted demand decreases  we could have excess inventories which may result in a write off of some or all of our inventory 
we may need to secure additional financing and without such additional financing we may be unable to fund ongoing operations or grow the business 
although we have generated a profit in recent quarters  we have a history of losses 
we may have to secure additional financing to complete our research and development activities  commercialize our current and proposed light based products  and fund ongoing operations 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained 
we may also determine  depending upon the opportunities available  to seek additional debt or equity financing to fund the costs of operations or expansion 
additionally  if we incur indebtedness to fund increased levels of accounts receivable  finance the acquisition of capital equipment  or if we issue debt securities in connection with any acquisition we will be subject to risks associated with incurring substantial additional indebtedness 
our quarterly operating results are and may continue to be volatile  and that may hurt the price of our common stock 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could decline 
failure to receive shipments of critical components could reduce revenues and reduced reliability of critical components could increase expenses 
we develop light based systems that incorporate third party components 
some of these items are custom made or otherwise not readily available on the market 
we purchase some of these components from small  specialized vendors that are not well capitalized 
a disruption in the delivery of these key components could prevent us from manufacturing product and result in a decrease in revenue 
we depend on an acceptable level of reliability for purchased components 
reliability below expectations for key components could have an adverse affect on inventory and inventory reserves 
our products are subject to numerous medical device regulations 
compliance is expensive and time consuming 
without necessary clearances  we may be unable to sell products and compete effectively 
all of our current products are light based devices  which are subject to fda regulations for clinical testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion 
before a new product or a new use of or claim for an existing product can be marketed in the united states  we must obtain clearance from the fda 
the types of medical devices that we seek to market in the us generally must receive either k clearance or pma approval in advance from the us food and drug administration fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly and uncertain and generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
to date  the fda has deemed our products eligible for the k clearance process 
we believe that our products in development will receive similar treatment 
however  we cannot be sure that the fda will not impose the more burdensome pma approval process upon one or more of our future products  nor can we be sure that k clearance or pma approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
our products are subject to similar regulations in many international markets 
complying with these regulations is necessary for our strategy of expanding the markets for sales of our products into these countries 
compliance with the regulatory clearance process in any country is expensive and time consuming 
regulatory clearances may necessitate clinical testing  limitations on the number of sales and limitations on the type of end user  among other things 
in certain instances  these constraints can delay planned shipment schedules as design and engineering modifications are made in response to regulatory concerns and requests 
we may not be able to obtain clearances in each country in a timely fashion or at all  and our failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in those countries 
we have modified some of our products and sold them under prior k clearances 
the fda could retroactively decide the modifications required new k clearances and require us to cease marketing and or recall the modified products 
any modification to one of our k cleared devices that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any such decision 
we have modified some of our marketed devices  but we believe that new k clearances were not required 
we cannot be certain that the fda would agree with any of our decisions not to seek k clearance 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance for any modification  we also may be required to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until we obtain a new k clearance 
we may also be subject to state regulations 
state regulations  and changes to state regulations  may prevent sales to particular end users which may decrease revenues or prevent growth of revenues 
our products may also be subject to state regulations 
federal regulation allows our products to be sold to and used by licensed practitioners as determined on a state by state basis 
as a result  in some states non physicians may purchase and operate our product 
however  a state could disagree with our decision to sell to a particular type of end user or change regulations preventing sales to particular types of end users 
thus  state regulations and changes to state regulations may decrease revenues or prevent growth of revenues 
the purchase and use of our products by non physicians may result in their misuse  which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation 
achieving complete compliance with fda regulations is difficult  and if we fail to comply  we could be subject to fda enforcement action 
we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda to determine compliance with regulatory requirements 
the fda s regulatory scheme is complex  especially the quality system regulation qsr  which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures 
this complexity makes complete compliance difficult to achieve 
also  the determination as to whether a qsr violation has occurred is often subjective 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with the qsr or other applicable requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  including a public warning letter or other stronger remedies  such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension  or total shutdown of our production  refusing our requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products  withdrawing product approvals already granted or criminal prosecution 
failure to manage our relationships with third party researchers effectively may limit our access to new technology  increase the cost of licensing new technology  and divert management attention from our core business 
we are dependent upon third party researchers over whom we do not have absolute control to satisfactorily conduct and complete research on our behalf 
we are also dependent upon third party researchers to grant us licensing terms  which may or may not be favorable for products and technology which they may develop 
at present  our principal research partner is the wellman laboratories of photomedicine at massachusetts general hospital 
we provide research funding  light technology and optics know how in return for licensing rights with respect to specific dermatologic and cosmetic applications and patents 
in return for certain exclusive license rights  we are subject to due diligence obligations in order to maintain such exclusivity 
our success will be dependent upon the results of research with our partners and meeting due diligence obligations 
we cannot be sure that third party researchers will agree with our interpretation of the terms of our agreements  that we will meet our due diligence obligations  or that such research agreements will provide us with marketable products in the future or that any of the products developed under these agreements will be profitable for us 
our common stock could be further diluted by the conversion of outstanding options and warrants 
in the past  we have issued and still have outstanding convertible securities in the form of options and warrants 
we have and may continue to issue options and warrants as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees  directors and consultants or others who provide services to us 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the conversion and exercise of these securities 
such a conversion would dilute our stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our proprietary technology has only limited protections which may not prevent competitors from copying our new developments 
this may impair our ability to compete effectively  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our intellectual property rights to prevent such copying 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  licenses and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and third parties with whom we work  including but not limited to consultants and vendors  to restrict access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
costly and time consuming lawsuits may be necessary to enforce and defend patents issued or licensed exclusively to us  to protect our trade secrets and or know how or to determine the enforceability  scope and validity of others intellectual property rights 
such lawsuits may result in patents issued or licensed exclusively to us to be found invalid and unenforceable 
our competitors also may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology and which do not infringe our patents 
claims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products or require us to pay royalties or incur substantial costs from litigation or development of non infringing technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
the light based cosmetic and dermatology industry in particular is characterized by a large number of patents and related litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
because our resources are limited and patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time  we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes any patents or patent applications 
any claims for patent infringement  regardless of merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the light based industry have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and often require the payment of ongoing royalties  which could have a negative impact on gross margins 
there can be no assurance that necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms  or that we could redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  if necessary 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our charter documents and delaware law may discourage potential takeover attempts 
our second restated certificate of incorporation and our by laws contain provisions that could discourage takeover attempts or make more difficult the acquisition of a substantial block of our common stock 
our by laws require a stockholder to provide to our secretary advance notice of director nominations and business to be brought by such stockholder before any annual or special meeting of stockholders  as well as certain information regarding such nomination and or business  the stockholder and others known to support such proposal and any material interest they may have in the proposed business 
they also provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors 
these provisions could delay any stockholder actions that are favored by the holders of a majority of our outstanding stock until the next stockholders meeting 
in addition  the board of directors is authorized to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock that  if issued  could dilute and adversely affect various rights of the holders of common stock and  in addition  could be used to discourage an unsolicited attempt to acquire control of us 
we are also subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the application of section may limit the ability of stockholders to approve a transaction that they may deem to be in their best interests 
these provisions of our second restated certificate of incorporation  by laws and the delaware general corporation law could deter certain takeovers or tender offers or could delay or prevent certain changes in control or management of us  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price 
in april  we adopted a shareholder rights plan rights plan 
the rights plan is intended to protect shareholders from unfair or coercive takeover practices 
in accordance with the rights plan  the board of directors declared a dividend distribution of series a right for each share of common stock outstanding until the rights become exercisable 
see note  stockholders equity and exhibit  rights agreement with american stock transfer and trust company dated april  we may not be able to successfully collect licensing royalties 
in past years  material portions of our revenues consisted of royalties from sub licensing patents licensed to us on an exclusive basis by massachusetts general hospital 
lumenis failed to make the royalty payments due since october  for sales of their lightsheer diode laser system 
on february   we terminated our license agreement with lumenis 
see legal proceedings this reduction and any other loss or reduction in our royalty revenues could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition  affect future liquidity and prevent us from maintaining profitability 
we face risks associated with pending litigation and there can be no assurance that the royalty amounts from other third parties will not decrease or that we will be able to collect all licensing royalties owed by current licensees or increase royalties by sub licensing additional third parties 
we are involved in disputes with other third parties  including cutera  inc formerly altus medical inc  see legal proceedings 
such disputes have resulted in litigation with such parties 
we have incurred  and likely will continue to incur  legal expenses in connection with such matters 
there can be no assurance that such litigation will result in favorable outcomes for us 
any adverse result in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to attract and retain key executives and research and development personnel that we need to succeed 
as a small company with less than employees  our success depends on the services of key employees in executive and research and development positions 
the loss of the services of one or more of these employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain  and motivate highly skilled employees 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so 
we face a risk of financial exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in personal injury 
our products are and will continue to be designed and manufactured with numerous safety features  but it is possible that consumers could be adversely affected by use of one of our products 
furthermore  in the event that any of our products prove to be defectively designed and manufactured  we may be required to recall and redesign such products 
although we have not experienced any material losses due to product liability claims to date  there can be no assurance that we will not experience such losses in the future 
we maintain general liability insurance and umbrella coverage  however  there can be no assurance that such coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or that such coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred 
in the event we are found liable for damages in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage or if any claim or product recall results in significant adverse publicity against us  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  although our products have been and will continue to be designed to operate in a safe manner  and although we attempt to educate customers with respect to the proper use of our products  misuse of our products by personnel over whom we cannot exert control may result in the filing of product liability claims or significant adverse publicity against us 
disappointing quarterly revenue or operating results could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict and may swing sharply from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue is difficult to forecast for many reasons  some of which are outside of our control 
for example  many factors are related to market supply and demand  including potential increases in the level and intensity of price competition between our competitors and us  potential decrease in demand for our products and possible delays in market acceptance of our new products 
other factors are related to our customers and include changes in or extensions of our customers budgeting and purchasing cycles and changes in the timing of product sales in anticipation of new product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors 
factors related to our operations may also cause quarterly revenue or operating results to fall below expectations  including absence of significant product backlogs  our effectiveness in our manufacturing process  unsatisfactory performance of our distribution channels  service providers  or customer support organizations  and timing of any acquisitions and related costs 
we face risks associated with product warranties 
we could incur substantial costs as a result of product failures for which we are responsible under warranty obligations 
because we derive approximately half of our revenue from international sales  we are susceptible to currency fluctuations  long payment cycles  credit risks and other risks associated with conducting business overseas 
we sell approximately half of our products and services outside the us international product revenue  consisting of sales from our distributors in japan  europe  australia  asia pacific rim and south and central america and sales shipped directly to international locations from the united states was of total product revenue for the year ended  and we expect that international sales will continue to be significant 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected by risks associated with international sales 
in particular  longer payment cycles common in foreign markets  credit risk and delays in obtaining necessary import or foreign regulatory approvals for products may occur 
in addition  significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies could cause us to lower our prices and thus reduce our profitability  or could cause prospective customers to push out orders to later dates because of the increased relative cost of our products in the aftermath of a currency devaluation or currency fluctuation 
managing our relationship with gillette effectively may divert the attention of key technical personnel and management from the core business 
if gillette ends the relationship our stock price could fall  and we may be unable to bring a home use hair removal device for women to the market 
on february   we entered into a development and license agreement with gillette to complete development and commercialize a home use  light based hair removal device for women 
we believe that this represents a unique opportunity to bring light based devices to the mass market 
under the agreement  significant resources and the attention of key technical personnel and management will be directed to the development of such a device even though such device will not likely be commercialized for several years  if ever 
in addition  we cannot be sure that gillette will agree with our interpretation of the terms of the agreement  that the agreement will provide us with marketable products in the future or that we will receive payments for any of the products developed under the agreement 
during the term of the agreement  gillette has the ability to choose not to continue and may terminate the agreement 
if gillette terminates the agreement  the price of our common stock could fall significantly  and we will not receive certain payments 
we may proceed to develop and commercialize the device on our own or with a third party 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement such a strategy 
in addition  after commercialization of such device  gillette is to pay us a percentage of net sales of such device 
certain of these percentages of net sales are only owed if the device is covered by valid patents 
there can be no assurance that valid patents will cover the device in any or all countries in which the device will be manufactured  used or sold 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see note  development and license agreement with gillette and exhibit  the development and license agreement with the gillette company effective february  with redacted exhibits managing our contract with the army effectively may divert the attention of key technical personnel and management from the core business 
we may be unable to complete the project within the time period which may impact our ability to receive future government contracts 
on february   we announced that we were awarded a million research contract by the department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
we believe this represents a unique opportunity to address pfb 
although the project is scheduled to last for nineteen months  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the project within that time period which may impact our ability to receive future government contracts 
under the agreement  significant resources and the attention of key technical personnel and management will be directed to the development of such a device even though such device will not likely be ready for military use for several years  if ever 
we face risks associated with section a securities act of prior to june   arthur andersen llp served as our independent auditors 
on march   arthur andersen was indicted on federal obstruction of justice charges arising from the government s investigation of enron corporation and on june   arthur andersen was found guilty 
arthur andersen ceased practicing before the sec by august  on june   we dismissed arthur andersen and retained ernst young llp as its independent auditors for its fiscal year ended december  sec rules require us to present historical audited financial statements in various sec filings  such as registration statements  along with arthur andersen s consent to our inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report in those filings 
since arthur andersen no longer practices public accounting  we will not be able to obtain the consent of arthur andersen to the inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report in our relevant current and future filings 
the sec has provided regulatory relief designed to allow companies that file reports with the sec to dispense with the requirement to file a consent of arthur andersen in certain circumstances  but purchasers of securities sold under our registration statements  which were not filed with the consent of arthur andersen to the inclusion of arthur andersen s audit report will not be able to sue arthur andersen pursuant to section a of the securities act of and therefore the purchasers right of recovery under that section may be limited as a result of the lack of our ability to obtain arthur andersen s consent 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and debt securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial because of the short term nature of these investments
