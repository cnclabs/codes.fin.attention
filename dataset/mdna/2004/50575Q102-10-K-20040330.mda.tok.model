ladenburg capital management 
from august through november  ladenburg capital was one of our principal operating subsidiaries in the securities brokerage industry 
ladenburg capital previously operated as a broker dealer subject to regulation by the sec and the nasd 
ladenburg capital acted as an introducing broker  market maker  underwriter and trader for its own account 
in july  the market making activities of ladenburg capital were terminated 
certain employees working in ladenburg capital s market making area were offered employment with ladenburg 
in november  ladenburg capital terminated its remaining broker dealer operations but continued with its other line of business 
ladenburg capital voluntarily filed at that time to withdraw as a broker dealer  which withdrawal became effective in january in conjunction with providing employment to certain former ladenburg capital brokers  ladenburg agreed to and is currently servicing these brokers customer accounts 
litigation 
on may   a suit was filed in the us district court for the southern district of new york by sedona corporation against ladenburg  former employees of the ladenburg  pershing llc and a number of other firms and individuals 
the plaintiff alleges  among other things  that certain defendants not ladenburg purchased convertible securities from plaintiff and then allegedly manipulated the market to obtain an increased number of shares from the conversion of those securities 
ladenburg acted as placement agent and not as principal in those transactions 
plaintiff has alleged that ladenburg and the other defendants violated federal securities laws and various state laws 
the plaintiff seeks compensatory damages from the defendants of at least  and punitive damages of  our motion to dismiss the lawsuit is currently pending 
we believe the plaintiffs claims in this action are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them 
in october  an arbitration panel awarded  in a customer arbitration 
although we have increased our reserves to reflect this award  we have moved in court to vacate this award 
the motion to vacate is currently pending 
we have several other various pending arbitrations claiming substantial amounts of damages  including one which is seeking compensatory damages of employee stock purchase plan 
in november  our shareholders approved the ladenburg thalmann financial services inc employee stock purchase plan the plan  under which a total of  shares of common stock are available for issuance 
under this stock purchase plan  as currently administered by the compensation committee  all full time employees may use a portion of their salary to acquire shares of our common stock 
option periods have been initially set at three months long and commence on january  april  july and october of each year and end on march  june  september and december of each year 
the plan became effective november  and the first option period commenced april  during the year ended december    shares of our common stock were issued to employees under the plan  at an average price of 
per share  resulting in a capital contribution of closing of branch offices 
in january  we closed our cleveland  ohio retail sales office 
additionally  in june  we closed our ft 
lauderdale office  which constituted all of our market making activities 
as a result of our decision to eliminate our market making activities  our minimum net capital requirement decreased from  to write off of leasehold improvements 
in may  ladenburg relocated approximately of its employees from its new york city office to its melville  new york office 
as a result of this move  ladenburg ceased using one of the several floors it occupies in its new york city office  and the net book value of the leasehold improvements was written off 
in conjunction with the write off of these leasehold improvements  the unamortized deferred rent credit representing reimbursement from the landlord of such leasehold improvements was also written off 
the write off of unamortized leasehold improvements of  net of the unamortized deferred rent credit of  resulted in a net charge to operations of during critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
clearing arrangements 
ladenburg does not carry accounts for customers or perform custodial functions related to customers securities 
ladenburg introduces all of its customer transactions  which are not reflected in these financial statements  to its primary clearing broker  which maintains the customers accounts and clears such transactions 
additionally  the primary clearing broker provides the clearing and depository operations for ladenburg s proprietary securities transactions 
these activities may expose ladenburg to off balance sheet risk in the event that customers do not fulfill their obligations with the primary clearing broker  as ladenburg has agreed to indemnify its primary clearing broker for any resulting losses 
we continually assess risk associated with each customer who is on margin credit and record an estimated loss when we believe collection from the customer is unlikely 
we incurred losses from these arrangements  prior to any recoupment from our financial consultants  of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
customer claims 
in the normal course of business  our operating subsidiaries have been and continue to be the subject of numerous civil actions and arbitrations arising out of customer complaints relating to our activities as a broker dealer  as an employer and as a result of other business activities 
in general  in addition to the litigation with the landlord discussed below  the cases involve various allegations that our employees had mishandled customer accounts 
due to the uncertain nature of litigation in general  we are unable to estimate a range of possible loss related to lawsuits filed against us  but based on our historical experience and consultation with counsel  we typically reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages assessed against us 
we have accrued  and  for potential arbitration and lawsuit losses as of december  and  respectively 
however  we have in the past been assessed damages that exceeded our reserves 
if we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims  or if we are unable to adequately estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed against us from claims that arise in the future and reserve accordingly  our operating income would be reduced 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
september  events 
on september   terrorists attacked the world trade center complex in new york  which subsequently collapsed and damaged surrounding buildings  including one occupied by a branch office of ladenburg capital 
these events resulted in the suspension of trading of us equity securities for four business days and precipitated the relocation of approximately employees to ladenburg s mid town new york headquarters 
some of ladenburg s and ladenburg capital s business was temporarily disrupted 
we are insured for loss caused by physical damage to property  including repair or replacement of property 
we are also insured for lost profits due to business interruption  including costs related to lack of access to facilities 
we will record future reimbursements from insurance proceeds related to certain september  expenses when the reimbursements are actually received 
although the claim to the insurance carrier is significantly greater  the net book value of the lost property  as well as the costs incurred to temporarily replace some of the lost property  has been recorded as a receivable as of december  we received insurance proceeds of in july representing an advance relating to damaged property  which was applied against our receivable 
the receivable balance as of december   representing the net book value of the damaged property and subsequent construction costs  was  in october  we filed a proof of loss with the insurance carrier  for an amount in excess of the policy limits of approximately  there are no assurances  however  that we will recover the full amount of insurance available to ladenburg and ladenburg capital as a result of this claim 
ladenburg capital is currently in litigation with its landlord seeking a declaratory judgment that the lease in this building near the world trade center be deemed terminated because  among other things  the premises were unsafe and uninhabitable for a period of days after september   pursuant to a lease provision giving ladenburg capital the right to terminate in those circumstances 
we believe that ladenburg capital will prevail and intend to pursue this claim vigorously 
however  in the event that ladenburg capital does not prevail  it may incur additional future expenses to terminate the long term commitment or  to the extent of foregone rental income in the event ladenburg capital does not sublease the office space for an amount at least equal to the lease obligations 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on ladenburg capital s financial position and liquidity 
exit or disposal activity 
during the fourth quarter of  we early adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
under sfas no 
 a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
for operating leases  a liability for costs that will continue to be incurred under the lease for its remaining term without economic benefit to the entity shall be recognized and measured at its fair value when the entity ceases using the right conveyed by the lease the cease use date 
the fair value of the liability at the cease use date shall be determined based on the remaining lease rentals  reduced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
in may  ladenburg relocated approximately of its employees from its new york city office to its melville  new york office 
as a result of this move  ladenburg ceased using one of the several floors it occupies in its new york city office  and the net book value of the leasehold improvements was written off 
in accordance with sfas no 
 as estimated future sublease payments that could be reasonably obtained for the property exceed related rental commitments under the lease  no liability for costs associated with vacating the space has been provided 
additional costs may be incurred  to the extent of foregone rental income in the event ladenburg does not sublease the office space for an amount at least equal to the lease obligations 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on ladenburg s financial position and liquidity 
fair value 
trading securities owned and securities sold  but not yet purchased on our consolidated statements of financial condition are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  with related unrealized gains and losses recognized in our results of operations 
the determination of fair value is fundamental to our financial condition and results of operations and  in certain circumstances  it requires management to make complex judgments 
fair values are based on listed market prices  where possible 
if listed market prices are not available or if the liquidation of our positions would reasonably be expected to impact market prices  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors  including dealer price quotations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the fixed income and equity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting principal trading revenues 
the illiquid nature of certain securities or debt instruments also requires a high degree of judgment in determining fair value due to the lack of listed market prices and the potential impact of the liquidation of our position on market prices  among other factors 
impairment of goodwill 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and were required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues on january  and on a periodic basis thereafter 
in connection with the reporting of results for the second quarter of  based on the overall declines in the us equity markets and the conditions prevailing in the broker dealer industry  we engaged an independent appraisal firm to value our goodwill as of june  based on this valuation  an impairment charge of  of goodwill was indicated and recorded in september the goodwill was generated in the ladenburg acquisition in may  and the charge reflected overall market declines since the acquisition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we account for taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expense on the timing differences between the tax basis and book basis of its assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax amounts as of december   which consist principally of the tax benefit of net operating loss carryforwards and accrued expenses  amount to  after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  especially the fact we have sustained operating losses during and and that we continue to be affected by conditions in the economy  we have determined that a valuation allowance at december  was necessary to fully offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  expiring in various years from through  of which approximately are subject to restrictions on utilization 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  our revenues for decreased  from primarily as a result of decreased commissions of  decreased net principal transactions of  decreased investment banking fees of  net of increased other revenues of  our revenues were adversely affected by the decrease in our number of registered representatives in versus our expenses for decreased  from primarily as a result of the  impairment of goodwill in  decreased compensation and benefits of  decreased brokerage  communication and clearance fees of  and decreased other expenses of  our revenues for consisted of commissions of  net principal transactions of  investment banking fees of  investment advisory fees of  interest and dividends of  syndicate and underwriting income of and other income of  our revenues for consisted of commissions of  net principal transactions of  investment banking fees of  investment advisory fees of  interest and dividends of  syndicating and underwriting income of and other income of  our expenses for consisted of compensation and benefits of  write off of leasehold improvements of and various other expenses of  our expenses for consisted of compensation and benefits of  impairment of goodwill of  write off of furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements of  and other expenses of  the  decrease in commission income was primarily a result of a decrease in the number of registered representatives we employed during compared to we employed registered representatives as of december  versus as of december  the  decrease in net principal transactions was primarily the result of decreases in trading income of  in the period 
the  decrease in investment banking fees was primarily the result of decreased revenue from private placement and advisory assignments due to the decrease in capital markets activity in compared to  as well as a reduction in the number of professional staff in the corporate finance area of the investment banking department  from at december  to at december  the decrease in compensation expense of  was primarily due to the net decrease in revenues and various staff reductions in the third and fourth quarters of as well as the first and second quarters of the decrease of  decrease in brokerage  communication and clearance fees is primarily due to the clearing conversion  the decrease in proprietary trading activities and the decreased amount of agency commission transactions in compared to the  decrease in other expenses was primarily due to decreases in advertising  customer arbitration settlements  insurance premiums expense  license and registration fees  travel and valuation allowances relating to receivables 
in connection with the reporting of the results for the second quarter of  based on the overall declines in the us equity markets and the conditions prevailing in the broker dealer industry  the company completed an additional impairment review and recorded a  charge for the impairment of goodwill  which was generated in the ladenburg acquisition 
the charge reflected the overall market declines since the acquisition in may during this review  an independent appraisal firm was engaged to value the company s goodwill as of june  the appraiser valued the businesses using a weighted average of each unit s projected discounted cash flow  with a weighted average cost of capital of  and a fair market approach using market comparables for ten companies 
the appraiser weighted the discounted cash flow for each unit at and the fair market approach at 
the discounted cash flow was based on management s revised projections of operating results at june  based on this valuation  an impairment charge of  of goodwill was indicated and recorded for the second quarter of in may  ladenburg relocated approximately of its employees from its new york city office to its melville  new york office 
as a result  ladenburg ceased using one of the several floors it occupies in its new york city office 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have evaluated our liability with respect to this space  taking into account estimated future lease payments that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
in this evaluation  we concluded that the net book value of the leasehold improvements should be written off 
accordingly  the unamortized deferred rent credit representing reimbursement from the landlord of such leasehold improvements was also written off 
during the second quarter of  the write off of leasehold improvements  net of accumulated amortization  and the write off of the unamortized deferred rent credit resulted in a net charge to operations of income tax expense for was compared to  in after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  especially the fact we have sustained operating losses during and and that we continue to be affected by conditions in the economy  management determined that a valuation allowance at december  was necessary to fully offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
the income tax rate for the and periods does not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates as a result of unrecognized net operating losses  the change in valuation allowances  state and local income taxes and permanent differences 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our revenues for decreased  from primarily as a result of decreases in net principal transactions of  offset by an increase in commissions of  our revenues were adversely affected by the overall declines in the us equity markets and the continuing weak operating environment for the broker dealer industry 
for comparative purposes  the period includes revenues generated by the ladenburg capital operations for the full year while the period includes revenues generated by the ladenburg capital operations from may  to december  our expenses for  exclusive of the  goodwill impairment charge  increased the overall net increase includes an increase in rent and occupancy of  an increase in professional services of  and a net increase in various other expenses of  net of decreased employee compensation of  and decreased brokerage  communication and clearance fees of  for comparative purposes  the period includes expenses incurred by the ladenburg capital operations for the full year while the period includes expenses incurred by the ladenburg capital operations from may  to december  our revenues for consisted of commissions of  net principal transactions of  investment banking fees of  syndicate and underwriting income of  interest and dividends of  investment advisory fees of  and other income of  our revenues for consisted of commissions of  net principal transactions of  investment banking fees of  syndicate and underwriting income of  interest and dividends of  investment advisory fees of  and other income of  our expenses for consisted of employee compensation and benefits of  impairment of goodwill of  and other expenses of  our expenses for consisted of employee compensation and benefits of  and other expenses of  the  increase in commissions was primarily the result of the impact of the acquired ladenburg capital operations  which provided additional commission income of  in versus  in the period 
the  decrease in investment banking fees was primarily the result of decreased revenue from private placement and advisory assignments due to the decrease in capital markets activity 
the  decrease in principal transactions was primarily the result of decreases in trading income of  in the period and a decrease in sales credits caused by the continued significant decline in the market for equity securities 
the decrease in compensation expense of  was primarily due to the net decrease in revenues 
as discussed above  in  we recorded a  charge for the impairment of goodwill  which was generated in the acquisition of the ladenburg capital operations 
income tax expense for was  compared to in the income tax rate for did not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates primarily as a result of an increase in the valuation allowance of  state and local taxes and permanent differences 
the income tax rate for did not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates primarily as a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance of  state and local taxes and permanent differences 
after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  especially the fact we have sustained operating losses during and for the year ended december  and that we continue to be affected by conditions in the economy  management has determined that a valuation allowance at december  was necessary to offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
accordingly  during  we increased our valuation allowance to fully offset the deferred tax assets based on the likelihood of future realization 
in addition  the income tax rate for the and periods does not bear a customary relationship to effective tax rates as a result of state and local income tax expense and limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carrybacks 
liquidity and capital resources approximately of our assets at december  are highly liquid  consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trading securities owned and receivables from clearing brokers  all of which fluctuate  depending upon the levels of customer business and trading activity 
receivables from broker dealers  which are primarily from our primary clearing broker  turn over rapidly 
as a securities dealer  we may carry significant levels of securities inventories to meet customer needs 
a relatively small percentage of our total assets are fixed 
the total assets or the individual components of total assets may vary significantly from period to period because of changes relating to economic and market conditions  and proprietary trading strategies 
ladenburg is subject to the net capital rules of the sec 
therefore  it is subject to certain restrictions on the use of capital and its related liquidity 
ladenburg s regulatory net capital  as defined  of  exceeded minimum capital requirements of by  at december  failure to maintain the required net capital may subject ladenburg to suspension or expulsion by the nyse  the sec and other regulatory bodies and ultimately may require its liquidation 
the net capital rule also prohibits the payment of dividends  redemption of stock and prepayment or payment of principal of subordinated indebtedness if net capital  after giving effect to the payment  redemption or prepayment  would be less than specified percentages of the minimum net capital requirement 
compliance with the net capital rule could limit the operations of ladenburg that requires the intensive use of capital  such as underwriting and trading activities  and also could restrict our ability to withdraw capital from it  which in turn  could limit our ability to pay dividends and repay and service our debt 
in june  we closed our ft 
lauderdale office  which constituted all of our market making activities 
as a result of our decision to eliminate our market making activities  effective june   our minimum net capital requirement decreased from  to ladenburg  as guarantor of its customer accounts to its primary clearing broker  is exposed to off balance sheet risks in the event that its customers do not fulfill their obligations with the clearing broker 
in addition  to the extent ladenburg maintains a short position in certain securities  it is exposed to future off balance sheet market risk  since its ultimate obligation may exceed the amount recognized in the financial statements 
net cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended december  were  as compared to for the period 
cash used in operating activities increased to  for the year ended december  compared with in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in receivables from clearing brokers  of  in compared to a decrease of  in  decreases of net operating assets of limited partnership of  in versus increases of net operating assets of limited partnership of  in and a decrease in income taxes receivable of  in versus an increase of  in these changes were offset by a  decrease in net loss and decreases of net trading securities owned of  in versus  in non cash charges in associated with the impairment of goodwill  write off of deferred tax assets  and write off of furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements of  contributed significantly to the decrease in net loss of  in and  in net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  were compared to net cash flows provided by investing activities of  for the period 
the difference is due to a decrease in purchases of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements during the period 
there was  of cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december   primarily representing  of distributions to limited partners of the ladenburg focus fund 
there was  of cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  period  representing the issuance by us of  of promissory notes payable offset by the repayment of  of outstanding promissory notes payable and a decrease in the amount of collateral required under our letter of credit agreement with one of our landlords in the period 
we are obligated under several noncancellable lease agreements for office space  which provide for minimum lease payments  net of lease abatement and exclusive of escalation charges  of  in and approximately  per year until such amounts exclude the lease referred to in the following paragraph 
in addition  one of the leases obligates the company to occupy additional space at the landlord s option  which may result in aggregate additional lease payments of up to through june ladenburg capital may have potential liability under a terminated lease for office space in new york city which it was forced to vacate during due to the events of september  ladenburg capital no longer occupies the space and believes it has no further lease obligation pursuant to the terms of the lease 
this lease  which  had it not terminated as a result of the events of september   would have expired by its terms in march  provides for future minimum payments aggregating approximately  payable in  per year from through and thereafter 
ladenburg capital is currently in litigation with the landlord in which it is seeking judicial determination of the termination of the lease 
if ladenburg capital is not successful in this litigation  it plans to sublease the property 
ladenburg capital has provided for estimated costs in connection with this lease and has recorded a liability at december  and additional costs may be incurred in connection with terminating this lease  or if not terminated  to the extent of foregone rental income in the event ladenburg capital does not sublease the office space for an amount at least equal to the lease obligations 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on ladenburg capital s financial position and liquidity 
ladenburg ceased using one of the several floors it occupies in its new york city office and is currently seeking to sublet the property 
in accordance with sfas no 
 ladenburg s management evaluates ladenburg s liability with respect to this space on a quarterly basis  taking into account estimated future sublease payments that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
in these evaluations  ladenburg s management concluded that no liability for this lease was required to be recorded as of december  additional costs may be incurred  to the extent of foregone rental income in the event ladenburg does not sublease the office space for an amount at least equal to the lease obligations 
such costs may have a material adverse effect on ladenburg s financial position and liquidity 
in conjunction with the may acquisition of ladenburg  we issued a total of  principal amount of senior convertible promissory notes due december  to new valley corporation  berliner effektengesellschaft ag and frost nevada  limited partnership which was subsequently assigned to frost nevada investments trust 
the  principal amount of notes issued to new valley and berliner  the former stockholders of ladenburg  bear interest at per annum  and the  principal amount of the note issued to frost nevada bears interest at per annum 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock and are secured by a pledge of the stock of ladenburg 
on august   we borrowed  from each of new valley and frost nevada in order to supplement the liquidity of our broker dealer operations 
the loans  which bore interest at above the prime rate  were repaid in january on march   we borrowed  from new valley 
the loan  which bears interest at above the prime rate  was due on the earlier of december  or the completion of one or more equity financings where we receive at least  in total proceeds 
the terms of the loan restrict us from incurring or assuming any indebtedness that is not subordinated to the loan so long as the loan is outstanding 
on july   we borrowed an additional  from new valley collectively  with the march loan  the loans on the same terms as the march loan 
in november  new valley agreed in connection with the clearing loans  to extend the maturity of the loans to december  and to subordinate the loans to the repayment of the clearing loans 
on june   new valley  berliner and frost nevada agreed with us to forbear until may  payment of the interest due to them under the senior convertible promissory notes held by these entities on the interest payment dates of the notes commencing june  through march the forbearance interest payments 
on march   the holders of the senior convertible promissory notes agreed to extend the interest forbearance period to january  with respect to interest payments due through december  interest on the deferred amounts accrues at on the new valley and berliner notes and on the frost nevada investments trust note 
we also agreed to apply any net proceeds from any subsequent public offerings to any such deferred amounts owed to the holders of the notes to the extent possible 
as of december   accrued interest payments as to which a forbearance was received amounted to  as discussed above  in march  the holders of our senior convertible promissory notes agreed to convert such notes into approximately  shares of common stock at reduced conversion prices ranging from to per share  subject to shareholder approval 
concurrently with this agreement  we entered into an agreement with berliner  the holder of the remaining  aggregate principal amount of senior convertible promissory notes  pursuant to which we will repurchase the notes held by berliner  plus all accrued interest thereon  for  in cash 
we currently anticipate recording a pre tax charge in of approximately  in our statements of operations upon closing of these transactions 
the charge reflects expense attributable to the reduction in the conversion price of the notes to be converted  offset partially by the gain on the repurchase of the berliner notes 
the net balance sheet effect of the transactions will be an increase in our shareholders equity of approximately  notwithstanding the foregoing  we cannot assure you that our operations will generate funds sufficient to repay our other existing debt obligations as they come due 
our failure to repay our indebtedness and make interest payments as required by our debt obligations could have a material adverse affect on our operations 
on october   we borrowed an additional  from new valley 
the loan  which bore interest at above the prime rate  matured on the earliest of december   the next business day after we received our federal income tax refund for the fiscal year ended september   and the next business day after we received the clearing loans in connection with the clearing conversion 
this loan was repaid in december upon receipt of the clearing loans 
ladenburg also has  outstanding under a junior subordinated revolving credit agreement with an affiliate of its primary clearing broker that matures on october   under which borrowings incur interest at libor plus in november  we consummated the clearing conversion whereby we now clear substantially all of our business through one clearing agent  our primary clearing broker 
as part of the new agreement with this clearing agent  we are realizing significant cost savings from reduced ticket charges and other incentives

in general  the cases involve various allegations that our employees had mishandled customer accounts 
we believe that  based on our historical experience and the reserves established by us  the resolution of the claims presently pending will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  although we typically reserve an amount we believe will be sufficient to cover any damages assessed against us  we have in the past been assessed damages that exceeded our reserves 
if we misjudged the amount of damages that may be assessed against us from pending or threatened claims  or if we are unable to adequately estimate the amount of damages that will be assessed against us from claims that arise in the future and reserve accordingly  our financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
our liquidity position continues to be adversely affected by our inability to generate cash from operations 
accordingly  we have been forced to cut expenses as necessary 
in order to accomplish this  we have implemented certain cost cutting procedures throughout our operations including reducing the size of our workforce 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  in order to reduce future operating expenses  we terminated the operations of ladenburg capital and withdrew it as a broker dealer 
ladenburg capital filed at that time to withdraw as a broker dealer  which withdrawal became effective in january ladenburg has agreed to and is currently servicing the accounts of ladenburg capital and many of the employees of ladenburg capital were offered and have accepted employment with ladenburg 
the termination of ladenburg capital s operations reduced support expenses  operating expenses and general administrative expenses 
our overall capital and funding needs are continually reviewed to ensure that our liquidity and capital base can support the estimated needs of our business units 
these reviews take into account business needs as well as regulatory capital requirements of the subsidiary 
if  based on these reviews  it is determined that we require additional funds to support our liquidity and capital base  we would seek to raise additional capital through available sources  including through borrowing additional funds on a short term basis from new valley or from other parties  including our shareholders and clearing brokers 
additionally  we may seek to raise money through a rights offering or other type of financing 
in may  we filed a registration statement for a proposed  rights offering to the holders of our outstanding common stock  convertible notes  warrants and options in order to raise additional necessary working capital 
however  on august   we announced that we had decided to postpone the rights offering due to market conditions 
if additional funds were needed  we could attempt to consummate the rights offering  although we do not currently anticipate that a rights offering could be successfully completed absent a material improvement in market conditions and a significant increase in our stock price 
in the circumstance where the rights offering were ultimately consummated  we would be required to use the proceeds of the proposed rights offering to repay the loans as well as all accumulated forbearance interest payments  to the extent possible 
if we continue to be unable to generate cash from operations and are unable to find alternative sources of funding as described above  it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations
