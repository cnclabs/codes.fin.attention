item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our critical accounting estimates are those which we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties used to make them and the likelihood that materially different estimates would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is set forth below accruals and contingencies we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us  as well as for other known unasserted claims  including environmental  legal and tax matters 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these matters  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
in assessing probable losses  we make estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries  if any 
we accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as amended 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information concerning our contingencies 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of these matters and potential insurance recoveries  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
in addition as new information becomes available  we may need to reassess the amount of probable liability that needs to be accrued related to our contingencies 
all such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
we maintain an accrual for workers compensation  which is classified as other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of the accrual by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to workers compensation claims and payments  information provided to us by our insurance broker and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accrual is overstated or understated  we will adjust the assumptions utilized in our methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
revenue recognition we recognize our revenues upon shipment of the related goods 
allowances for estimated returns are provided when sales are recorded 
bad debt we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets including property  plant and equipment may be impaired  we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
the carrying value of the asset includes the original purchase price net of depreciation plus the value of all capital improvements net of depreciation 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
the estimated fair value is based on what we estimate the current sale price of the asset to be based on comparable sales information or other estimates of the asset s value 
any impairment losses we recognize are recorded as operating expenses 
in  we recognized million of impairment losses 
we did not recognize any impairment losses in in  the company reviewed assets held for sale and determined an additional  was required 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset 
in projecting the expected future operations of the asset  we base our estimates on future budgeted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and use growth assumptions to project these amounts out over the expected life of the underlying asset 
if actual conditions differ from those in our assumptions  the actual results of each asset s actual future operations could be significantly different from the estimated results we used in our analysis 
our operating results are also subject to the risks set forth under summary of accounting policies risk and uncertainties
