item business general we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive surgical procedures within the cardiovascular system in conjunction with our proprietary excimer laser system 
excimer laser technology delivers comparatively cool ultraviolet energy in short  controlled energy pulses to ablate or remove tissue 
our excimer laser system includes the cvx laser unit and various fiber optic delivery devices  including disposable catheters and sheaths 
our excimer laser system is the only excimer laser system approved in the united states and europe for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular applications 
our excimer laser system is used in complex atherectomy procedures to open clogged or obstructed arteries in the coronary vascular system 
it is also used to remove lead wires from patients with implanted pacemakers or cardioverter defibrillators  which are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
we are currently pursuing k marketing clearance from the food and drug administration fda for a laser based treatment of total occlusions blockages in the legs not crossable with a guidewire 
some of the patients with total occlusions in the leg suffer from critical limb ischemia cli  which is a debilitating condition that begins with resting leg pain and often leads to tissue loss or amputation as a result of a lack of blood flow to the legs 
a k application for treating patients with total occlusions not crossable with a guidewire was submitted to the fda in january and we expect a response from the fda  which may consist of additional questions  in april we also have regulatory approval to market our products in two key international markets 
we have received approval to market some of our coronary atherectomy products in japan  and are seeking additional approvals there for our newer coronary products and our lead removal product line 
during  we appointed a new distributor  dvx japan  who will assist us in pursuing reimbursement approval 
we currently expect reimbursement approval in  although there are no assurances that reimbursement will be received then  if 
table of contents at all 
we do not expect revenue increases in japan until reimbursement approval is received 
in europe  in addition to our coronary atherectomy and lead removal product lines  we have approval to market our products to treat artery blockages in the leg

strategy our strategy includes the following key points leverage technical expertise in generation and delivery of excimer energy 
we have designed our excimer laser platform to support multiple existing and potential therapeutic applications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease 
we are exploring additional applications of our core excimer laser technology for novel treatments of coronary and other vascular conditions 
we submitted a pre market approval supplement pmas to the food and drug administration fda in january  which requested approval to commercially market certain products for the treatment of critical limb ischemia 
even though the clinical trial endpoints were met  an advisory panel recommended non approval of our application at a meeting held in october  citing concerns about the clinical trial design for example  comparisons to a historical control group as opposed to a randomized trial and the specific benefit of the laser treatment since it was delivered adjunctively along with balloons and stents 
the fda followed the advice of the panel and notified us of the non approval of our pmas 
based on input from the advisory panel and the fda  we compiled data for the laser based treatment of patients with total occlusions not crossable with a guidewire 
most of the data was obtained from patients enrolled in the laci trial and the data from these patients was supplemented by data from two other sites that did not participate in the laci trial but followed the laci clinical trial protocol 
based on fda input  the application was submitted as a k application as compared with a pre market approval pma supplement submitted with the original laci application 
the k application is a less rigorous review cycle and has a day response time compared with days for a pma supplement 
we submitted our k application to the fda in january and we expect a response from the fda  which may consist of additional questions  in april the data showed that the limb salvage rate no major amputations among the patients treated was for those patients surviving six months following the procedure 
there was no difference in serious adverse events as compared with the entire set of patients treated in the laci trial 
although we believe the clinical data supports clearance to market our products for treatment of these patients  there can be no assurances that marketing clearance will be received from the fda 
we are also exploring the use of our technology to treat blockages caused by the formation of thrombus blood clots 
we are currently gathering clinical data for laser based treatment of acute myocardial infarction ami  or heart attack and saphenous vein grafts heart bypass grafts that develop blockages 
we expect to complete the clinical research in saphenous vein grafts in late or early we are currently fda approved to treat saphenous vein grafts so the clinical data from this trial  if successful  will be used for marketing the clinical advantages of our technology 
the clinical research associated with a laser based treatment of ami is in the feasibility stage and is expected to be completed in late or early assuming positive clinical data from the feasibility trial extended famili  we expect to initiate a randomized pivotal trial  which will take at least two years to complete 

table of contents gather and develop clinical data for publication in peer reviewed medical journals 
our physician customers adopt products and technologies primarily based on available clinical data 
historically  the clinical data for our technology  especially in coronary artery disease therapy  has been limited 
during  we expect the publication of clinical data in peer reviewed medical journals  which will discuss the use of our laser technology to treat ami heart attack  saphenous vein grafts  chronic total occlusions and peripheral artery disease 
expand disposable device revenues from existing customer base 
by training additional cardiologists  surgeons and other specialists at existing customer hospitals and introducing physicians already familiar with our products to new products and applications  we intend to increase our revenue stream from sales of current and future disposable devices to existing customers 
through our existing marketing and sales team  we are currently focused on two fda approved indications in the coronaries saphenous vein grafts and total occlusions as well as the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads that require removal as a result of infection or fracture 
expand installed customer base 
we intend to expand our customer base by continuing to focus our sales efforts on cardiac centers that perform the majority of interventional procedures 
for the years ended december  and december   respectively  we placed and laser systems in new accounts 
at december  our total worldwide installed base was laser systems in the united states 
in early  we implemented a temporary price promotion of  on our laser systems compared with our list price of  the price promotion contributed to the increased number of laser systems placed in compared with the price promotion for laser systems officially ended on september   however  quotes that were outstanding and contained promotional pricing as of september  were honored 
in addition to an outright sale of our laser systems  we offer several alternatives to our customers for the acquisition of our excimer lasers  including evaluation  fee rental and leasing through a third party leasing organization 
technology excimer laser ablation removes plaque  thrombotic materials  or tissue by delivering relatively cool excimer laser energy to a blockage or lesion 
this laser beam breaks down the molecular bonds of plaque or tissue in a process known as photoablation  without significant thermal damage to surrounding tissue 
the laser ablation of the material reduces the particles to about the size of a red blood cell  which is easily absorbed into the blood stream 
this helps to avoid a potential complication known as distal embolization  which is caused by particles dislodged during an angioplasty or atherectomy procedure that create a blockage elsewhere in the vascular system 
laser ablation involves the insertion of a laser catheter or sheath into an artery or vein through a small incision 
it is used with conventional angioplasty tools  such as guidewires and sheaths 
when the tip of the catheter or sheath has been placed at the site of the blockage or lesion  the physician activates the laser beam to ablate the plaque or tissue 
cvx excimer technology our proprietary cvx excimer laser unit is designed for use in a variety of cardiovascular applications 
when coupled with our fiber optic laser devices  the system generates and delivers nanometer wavelength ultraviolet energy pulses to a lesion to remove plaque or tissue 
the nanometer wavelength is on the relatively cool end of the ultraviolet spectrum 
the excimer laser is considered a contact laser  ablating material that is less than microns from the tip of the laser catheter or sheath 
on february   the food and drug administration fda approved the spectranetics cvx excimer laser unit and and millimeter diameter fiber optic catheters for the following six indications for use in the treatment of coronary artery disease saphenous vein grafts  total occlusions crossable by a guidewire  
table of contents ostial lesions blockages at the beginning of arteries  lesions with moderate calcification  long lesions  and lesions where angioplasty balloon failures have occurred 
additional catheter sizes and improved models to treat the six original indications have been approved by the fda over the ensuing years 
on october   we received fda approval for the use of the spectranetics excimer laser and related catheters for a seventh coronary indication for use within restenosed stents prior to brachytherapy radiation therapy 
in all of these complex coronary atherectomy indications  we offer an adjunct to traditional balloon angioplasty  stents and atherectomy rotational cutters and burrs devices 
we believe the use of the laser makes the treatment of complex lesions simple 
unlike conventional balloons that merely compress arterial plaque against the stent or vessel wall  laser atherectomy dissolves the material  resulting in a larger diameter opening 
the cvx excimer laser unit was initially approved for lead removal procedures on december   with several additional approvals following in later years as we expanded our lead removal product line 
in november  we received iso certification from the t v product service gmbh t v in munich  germany  which allows us to market our products in the european community within compliance of the manufacturing quality regulations 
we hold ec cert g  g and g  qa cert qz with en supplement with inclusion of iso in addition  we received cmdcas canadian certification by t v during january we have received ce communaute europeene mark registration for all of our current products 
the ce mark indicates that a product is certified for sale throughout the european union and that the manufacturer of the product complies with applicable safety and quality standards 
on september   in conjunction with our japanese distributor  we received regulatory approval from the japanese ministry of health and welfare mhw to market our laser and various sizes of our extreme  vitesse e and vitesse c coronary catheters in japan 
we have submitted our application for reimbursement approval for these products in japan  which may take up to two years to obtain 
we do not expect our sales in japan to increase unless and until reimbursement approval is attained 
we are working with our current distributor  dvx japan  to secure reimbursement approval and  if successful  expect this to occur sometime in in addition  we are in various stages of the submission process to obtain regulatory approval in japan for some of our newer products 
initial fda approval for use of the excimer laser for coronary applications was based on the results of the percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty study  which evaluated a registry of laser usage in blocked coronary arteries in  patients with a mean age of years 
clinical success ie  reduction in the size of the lesion to less than percent of the diameter of the artery without heart attack  death  or the need for emergency bypass surgery during hospitalization was achieved in of these patients 
of note  there was no difference in success rate or complications for long lesions  total occlusions crossable with a guidewire  saphenous vein grafts and aorto ostial lesions  suggesting that complex lesions could be safely and effectively treated with excimer laser coronary atherectomy 
we believe that the cvx system provides the following benefits dissolves underlying tissue 
the process of photoablation dissolves the tissue causing the blockage as opposed to merely compressing it against the arterial wall  as with balloon angioplasty 
we believe that the process of photoablation helps to reduce the incidence of distal embolization  whereby particles are dislodged from the lesion being treated  causing a blockage elsewhere in the vascular system 
reduced procedure time 
patient outcome audits  which compare excimer laser procedures to rotational atherectomy  reveal the excimer laser method shortens procedure times and reduces radiation exposure to the patient from fluoroscopic imaging used during the procedure 

table of contents ease of use 
during a laser procedure  it may be necessary to adjust laser energy output 
the cvx laser unit is computer controlled  which allows the physician to change energy levels without interrupting the treatment to remove the catheter from the patient for recalibration 
this feature also enables the physician to begin the procedure with the minimum level of energy that might be required and  if necessary  to easily adjust the energy level upward during the procedure 
product applications coronary excimer laser atherectomy background 
percutaneous coronary intervention  or pci  is a minimally invasive medical procedure used to treat coronary artery disease  or atherosclerosis  and is performed by interventional cardiologists and radiologists 
we estimate there are approximately  pci procedures performed annually in the united states 
we estimate that approximately to percent of these patients could benefit from the use of our products  particularly in complex lesions 
in these complex indications  we offer an adjunct to traditional balloon angioplasty and stenting or the need for coronary bypass surgery 
unlike conventional balloons that merely compress arterial plaque against the stent or vessel wall  laser atherectomy actually dissolves the material 
we believe the use of laser technology makes the treatment of complex lesions simple 
we focus our marketing and sales efforts on saphenous vein grafts  total occlusions crossable by a guidewire  and pre treatment of restenosed stents prior to brachytherapy  but also are approved for use in four other indications ostial lesions blockages at the beginning of arteries  lesions with moderate calcification  long lesions  and lesions where angioplasty balloon failures have occurred 
in europe  we focus our marketing efforts on the approved coronary indications shown above as well as laser treatment of all in stent restenoses and blockages in the arteries of the upper and lower legs 
total revenues associated with coronary excimer laser atherectomy were  for the year ended december   compared with  for the year ended december  we believe revenue has been declining for the last two years primarily as a result of a lack of recent  compelling clinical data supporting the use of the laser in the coronary vascular system combined with new atherectomy products introduced to the market during this period for example  the cutting balloon 
we have initiated clinical research in the area of saphenous vein grafts coral and coral reef and acute myocardial infarction extended famili 
the completion and publication of this clinical data are key drivers to growth in coronary atherectomy revenues 
in  clinical results from the carmel cohort of acute revascularization in myocardial infarction with excimer laser study successfully supported our request to the fda for a labeling change to our catheters that allows for individualization of use treatment for patients with ami  acute thrombosis or ejection fraction less than percent 
under the new labeling  patients with these clinical conditions can be treated with the laser after individual consideration by their doctor 
additionally  we completed the coral lake coronary grafts results following atherectomy with laser at lakeland regional medical center  florida registry  that studied the use of the excimer laser for the treatment of degenerated saphenous vein grafts 
we believe both studies included clinical data that supports the use of our technology in ami and saphenous vein grafts  respectively 
disposable laser catheters 
we have developed a broad selection of proprietary laser devices designed to meet physician needs and multiple indications for use  including excimer laser coronary atherectomy and peripheral excimer laser atherectomy in the upper and lower leg in europe 
early laser catheters contained only a few large optical fibers to transmit the laser energy 
these early devices were stiff  had difficulty accessing arterial anatomy and suffered from poor ablation characteristics 
current innovative laser catheter designs contain hundreds of very small diameter  flexible glass fibers that can access more difficult to reach 
table of contents coronary anatomy 
the smaller fibers also produce better laser energy distribution at the tip of the catheter for more uniform ablation 
laser catheters are designed to provide several advantages over other atherectomy devices 
these catheters  which we produce in sizes ranging from to millimeters in diameter  consist of concentric or eccentric bundles of optical fibers mounted within a thin plastic tubing 
fibers are coupled to the laser using a patented intelligent connector  which requires no adjustments by the physician 
this connector provides information about the device being used to the cvx laser unit computer  which controls the calibration cycle and energy output 
the catheter s combination of trackability  flexibility and ablation characteristics enables the physician to access difficult to treat lesions 
our line of disposable catheters includes the following extreme laser catheter 
in october  the fda approved the extreme laser concentric catheter  which was our first high performance coronary laser catheter 
it is an over the wire otw catheter with good flexibility and an active ablation area covering a high percentage of the catheter tip 
other catheter features include the patented metal rim tip designed for visualization and alignment and a proprietary lubricious coating for easy access 
the extreme laser catheter is available in   and millimeter tip diameters 
spectranetics has received the ce mark of approval for use of its extreme atherectomy line of catheters in europe  and has received approval from the mhw to market the  and millimeter size extreme catheters in japan but has not yet received reimbursement approval in japan 
vitesse e laser catheter 
the vitesse e eccentric rapid exchange rx laser catheter is our first directional coronary laser catheter 
the millimeter diameter catheter was approved by the fda in july  and the millimeter catheter was approved by the fda in september spectranetics received the ce mark of approval for use of these atherectomy catheters in europe in march and mhw approval for use in japan in september  but we are still awaiting japanese reimbursement approval 
this catheter utilizes an eccentric or one sided fiber array at the tip that can be rotated by the operator to create a larger channel through the blockage 
vitesse cos catheter 
the vitesse cos concentric laser catheter  which succeeded the vitesse c catheter  was approved by the fda in january like its predecessor which received regulatory approval in the united states in october and in japan in september  with reimbursement approval in japan still pending  this is a rapid exchange rx catheter  which incorporates a monorail design that can be threaded onto and exchanged over a guidewire more conveniently than over the wire models 
it is also compatible with a wide range of guidewires 
the fibers in the vitesse cos are optimally spaced and laboratory tests have demonstrated that it produces greater debulking  or plaque removal  compared with its predecessor catheter 
the vitesse cos laser catheter is available in  and millimeter tip diameters 
in europe  we received the ce mark of approval for this laser catheter in december point tm millimeter catheter 
the point tm concentric catheter comes in both the extreme otw and vitesse rx models 
the vitesse model received ce mark and fda approvals in july and august  respectively 
the extreme model received ce mark approval in europe in august and fda approval in the united states in july the point millimeter catheters are our smallest diameter atherectomy catheters and are designed for use in vessels as small as millimeters in diameter  as well as larger vessels with total occlusions passable by a guidewire or where angioplasty balloon failures have occurred 
on june   spectranetics received fda approval to market the point x catheter  which has the ability to use higher laser parameters to penetrate lesions where balloon failures have occurred and other difficult to treat lesions crossable by a guidewire 
spectranetics support catheter tm 
in november we received clearance from the fda to market the spectranetics support catheter in the 
and 
inch models 
a larger 
inch model was approved by the fda in september this is a non laser based accessory product designed for use in the cardiovascular system to support and assist standard guidewires to facilitate initial crossing of the blockage 
it also facilitates exchange of standard guidewires without losing access to the blockage 
we 
table of contents also received the ce mark of approval in march to market the 
and 
inch support catheter in europe  and the 
inch model received the ce mark of approval in july in february  we received clearance to market the quick cross tm support catheter  which is the second generation of the spectranetics support catheter 
cardiac lead removal systems background 
over  patients worldwide are implanted with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators  or icds  annually 
pacemakers and icds are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
we believe that approximately percent of these patients will eventually require pacemaker or icd lead replacement 
the current standard of care is to simply cap the replaced lead and leave it in the body 
our goal is to change the standard of care through the education of physicians as to the complications and associated costs of leaving the replaced leads in the body 
competitive methods available to remove implanted leads include open chest surgery and transvenous removal with plastic sheaths  each of which has significant drawbacks 
for example  open chest surgery is costly and traumatic to the patient 
the plastic sheath method sometimes results in damage to the cardiovascular system  thereby necessitating surgery  and may cause the lead to disassemble during the removal procedure 
for the year ended december   lead removal product revenue was  an increase of from  during the year ended december  the key driver of this revenue growth is an expanding patient population eligible for implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd  based on recent clinical research conducted by the large pacing companies guidant  medtronic  st 
jude 
the clinical research has shown that patients suffering from congestive heart failure as well as patients who have had prior heart attacks may have reduced mortality risk as a result of the implant of an icd 
since there are more leads attached to an icd and they are typically larger in diameter  there is often a space problem in the subclavian vein when icd s are implanted in patients that already have a pacemaker 
additionally  the potential for electrical crosstalk between the new and old leads is enhanced in this situation 
as a result  the old leads are more likely to be removed in these situations 
we plan to implement programs that will expand the lead removal market and will focus on programs that study the cost of complications associated with abandoned leads that have been capped and left in the body 
spectranetics laser sheath sls tm 
we have designed a laser assisted lead removal device  the spectranetics laser sheath sls  to be used with our cvx excimer laser unit to remove implanted leads with minimal force 
the sls uses excimer laser energy focused through the tip of the sls to facilitate lead removal by removing scar tissue surrounding the lead 
in addition to resulting in less trauma and a lower complication rate  procedure time is reduced significantly 
the sls consists of optical fibers arranged in a circle between inner and outer polymer tubing 
the inner opening of the device is designed to allow a lead wire to pass through it as the device slides over the lead wire and toward the tip in the heart 
following the removal of scar tissue with the sls  the lead wire is removed from the heart with counter traction 
we have been marketing our french fr sls since december in september  we received fda market approval for our fr and fr spectranetics laser sheaths  which are designed to free larger diameter implanted pacemaker and icd leads 
in february  we received fda approval to market an improved model of fr laser sheath 
in may  we received fda approval to market an improved model of the fr and fr laser sheath 
spectranetics received the ce mark of approval for use of its first generation laser sheath devices in europe in february and july  and second generation devices received the ce mark october and october lead locking device lld tm 
in october  we received clearance from the fda to market the lld under a k application 
this product was the first spectranetics product to go through the k regulatory process  which typically takes less time than other regulatory approval processes  such as pre market approval or a pre market approval supplement 
we also received the ce mark of approval for this 
table of contents product in europe in march the lld product complements our current sls product line and  since it is not laser based  can also be used in connection with the mechanical removal of pacemaker or defibrillator leads 
the lld is a novel mechanical device that assists in the removal of faulty leads by providing traction to the leads  which are typically wire spirals 
the lld is inserted into the center opening ie  lumen of the lead and then a braid surrounding the lld expands to fill and grip the entire length of the lead s inner circumference  in effect converting a spiral into a solid pipe  which can more easily be extracted 
other devices on the market  which merely grip the lead at the far end  provide less stability and frequently release their grip on the lead 
in a randomized clinical trial completed in october  the sls increased the complete lead removal success rate to percent from percent with other techniques 
a more recent study completed in and published in december reported that using both the sls and lld increased the success rate to percent 
peripheral vascular disease therapy background 
the prevalent treatment options for total blockages in the upper leg are medical management to minimize symptoms and bypass surgery 
amputation below the knee may be required for critical limb ischemia 
we estimate that approximately  upper bypass surgeries and  amputations are performed annually in the united states as a result of peripheral vascular blockages 
in addition  we estimate that about  people in the united states are treated for leg pain through either balloon angioplasty  stent implantation  and drug therapy 
laser therapy is being evaluated as an alternative treatment to bypass surgery  amputation and conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty 
our catheters for these applications are approved in europe for use in treating peripheral vascular disease 
clinical trials 
on january   spectranetics received fda approval to begin phase of the laci trial  which deals with multi vessel peripheral vascular disease in patients presenting with critical limb ischemia cli 
patients with cli have severe circulatory disease resulting in resting leg pain  non healing ulcers of the foot or lower leg  or gangrenous areas that are likely candidates for amputation rutherford categories   and 
frequently  these patients also suffer from coronary artery disease  hypertension and diabetes 
the phase trial enrolled patients at domestic and several european sites 
the primary endpoint of phase is limb salvage ie  freedom from major amputation for a month follow up period 
the last patient enrolled in the laci trial in april and the six month follow up phase was completed in october data from the trial indicated a success rate as compared with in the historical control group of patients treated with a variety of standard therapies  including bypass surgery 
there were no statistical differences in serious adverse events between the laci group and the historical control group 
we submitted the clinical data from the laci trial to the fda in january and an advisory panel to the fda reviewed our submission at a panel meeting on october  although the clinical trial endpoints were achieved  the panel recommended non approval  citing concerns over the non randomized nature of the trial  use of a historical control group  and the inability to distinguish the specific benefit of laser treatment  since it was used adjunctively with balloons and stents 
the fda  which generally follows the advisory panel s recommendation  issued a non approval letter following the panel meeting 
based on input at the advisory panel meeting and subsequent discussions with the fda  we are pursuing k clearance to market our products to patients who have total occlusions that are not crossable with a guidewire  which is a subset of the laci data 
on january   we submitted data on patients that showed a limb salvage rate ie  no major amputations among surviving patients six months after the procedure 
the data consisted of patients from the laci trial supplemented with an additional patients treated at two other sites that were not part of the original laci trial but followed the laci trial protocol 
based on fda input  the application was submitted as a k application as compared to a pre market approval pma supplement submitted along with the original laci application 
the k application is a less rigorous review cycle and has a day response time compared with days for a pma supplement 
the response could be additional questions from the fda or a definitive answer 
if the response consists of additional questions  the day review cycle may begin again with our response to the questions 
we submitted this data in a k application to the fda during january and it showed that the limb salvage rate among the patients 
table of contents treated was for those patients surviving six months following the procedure 
there was no difference in serious adverse events as compared with the entire set of patients treated in the laci trial 
although we believe the data we have submitted supports fda clearance  there are no assurances that fda clearance will be received 
the pela trial enrolled patients in a randomized trial comparing excimer laser treatment followed with balloon angioplasty to balloon angioplasty alone 
the trial was designed to test the safety and efficacy of treating total occlusions blockages of at least centimeters in length within the superficial femoral artery sfa 
the trial was designed to show superiority of the laser group over the balloon only group 
the clinical results showed equivalence in most study endpoints  including the primary endpoint  which was primary patency the degree in which the artery is open as measured by diameter stenosis blockage at one year by ultrasound with no reintervention 
the largest catheters used in the trial were mm in diameter as compared to vessel sizes treated in excess of mm in diameter 
we believe that the low catheter diameter in relation to vessel diameter adversely affected results and we are now evaluating product development opportunities for larger catheter diameters 
we are currently evaluating our regulatory strategy as to the pela data 
we may or may not submit the data to the fda requesting approval 
we cannot assure that the clinical trials using excimer laser catheters to unblock peripheral arteries will demonstrate our technology is safe  will result in favorable success rates or  if the trials are successful  that we will receive fda approval for these devices 
we have received ce mark of approval for our line of peripheral catheters in europe 
restenosed stents background 
stents are thin  steel  slotted tubes or coils that are implanted through a percutaneous procedure to support the walls of coronary arteries 
we estimate that approximately  stents are implanted in united states annually 
twenty to percent of stents may develop blockages due to restenosis  or tissue ingrowth  which can lead to partial or total occlusion of the arteries  and percent of them may be candidates for brachytherapy radiation therapy 
several clinical trials are underway and some have concluded evaluating the use of drug eluting stents  the next generation of stent technology 
these stents are coated with various types of drugs designed to inhibit restenosis 
clinical data from these trials demonstrate that restenosis rates are reduced to rates less than for certain lesions 
as a result  we expect the annual number of restenosed stent procedures to decline 
clinical trials 
on october   we received approval from the fda to market our coronary atherectomy products to pretreat in stent restenosis prior to brachytherapy 
as a result  we concluded enrollment in our laser angioplasty in restenosed stents lars trial  which had been conducted to study the use of our laser catheters in debulking stents which have restenosed 
we no longer intend to pursue the broader in stent restenosis label with or without brachytherapy in the united states 
spectranetics has received ce mark approval to allow us to market our excimer laser atherectomy catheters throughout europe for the treatment of restenosed stainless steel coronary stents  with or without brachytherapy 
sales and marketing our sales goals are to increase the use of laser catheters and other disposable devices and to increase the installed base of excimer laser systems 
we plan to introduce new physicians and institutions to the efficacy  safety  ease of use and growing indications of excimer laser technology through published studies of clinical applications 
by leveraging the success of existing product applications  we hope to promote the use of our technology in new applications 
providing customers with answers about the cost of acquisition  use of the laser and reimbursement codes is critical to the education process 
through the following marketing and distribution strategy  both in the united states and internationally  we believe that we will be positioned to capitalize not only on the core competency of excimer laser technology in coronary atherectomy  but also in lead extraction and in other new areas of development for excimer laser technology in the cardiovascular system 

table of contents domestic operations as of march  there are about  interventional cardiac catheterization laboratories in hospitals in the united states 
our united states sales efforts focus on the major cardiac catheterization labs  including teaching institutions  which perform the majority of interventional procedures 
our united states sales and marketing team consists of marketing managers  district sales managers and clinical account managers 
we are focused on expanding our product line and developing an appropriate infrastructure to support sales growth  and have increased our sales and marketing capabilities over the last few years through the addition of personnel to our marketing and sales team 
since the use of excimer laser technology is highly specialized  we believe that our marketing managers and direct sales team must have extensive knowledge about the use of our products and the various physician groups we serve 
our marketing activities are designed to support our direct sales team and include advertising and product publicity in trade journals  newsletters  continuing education programs  and attendance at trade shows and professional association meetings 
we currently have three marketing managers who are responsible for global marketing activities for a given market segment  ie  coronary artery disease therapy  cardiac lead removal systems and peripheral vascular disease therapy

products in class i are the least invasive and pose the least amount of risk  while products in class ii pose more potential risk to patients  and class iii products provide the most potential risk 
the fda approval process becomes more rigorous for products classified as higher potential risk 
section k devices section k of the ffdca is available in certain instances for class i and class ii products 
it requires that before introducing most class ii and some class i devices into interstate commerce  the company introducing the product must first submit information to the fda demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent in terms of safety and effectiveness to a device legally marketed prior to march when the fda determines that the device is substantially equivalent  the agency issues a clearance letter that authorizes marketing of the product 
the support catheter and lld have been precleared by the fda under the k process 
we are pursuing k clearance for catheters to be used in the treatment of total occlusions in the legs 
subsequent to its initial introduction  a manufacturer may make changes to its previously cleared products 
under certain circumstances  a new k is required when a manufacturer makes a change that could significantly affect the device s safety or effectiveness or the manufacturer makes a major change to the device s intended use 
before implementing the change  the manufacturer is responsible for evaluating each change to determine whether to file a new k 
there is a risk that the fda will not agree with the manufacturer s decision and will require the filing of a new k 
pma devices the cvx laser unit and most of our catheters used in the coronary anatomy are designated as class iii devices  except for the support catheter and lld  which are coronary devices that were cleared under section k of the ffdca 
class iii devices are devices that are represented to be life sustaining or life supporting  or that present potential serious risk of illness or injury 
class iii devices are subject to the most rigorous fda approval process  the pre market approval  or pma  process 
pre market approval of a class iii device generally requires the completion of three major steps 
the first step involves the granting of an investigational device exemption  or ide  by the fda  which permits the proposed product to be used in controlled human clinical trials 
upon completion of a sufficient number of clinical cases to determine the safety and effectiveness of the proposed product for specific indications  a pre market approval application is then prepared and submitted to the fda for review 
the pre market approval application must contain the results of the clinical trials  the results of all relevant bench tests  laboratory and animal studies  a complete description of the device and its components  and a detailed description of the methods  facilities  and controls used to manufacture the device 
in addition  the submission must include the proposed labeling and promotional literature 
if the fda determines that the pre market approval application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review  the fda will accept the application for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the pre market approval application  which represents the second major step in pre market approval of a class iii device 
an fda review of a pre market approval application generally takes one to two years from the date the pre market approval application is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended by the fda asking for more information or clarification of information already provided 
table of contents in the submission 
during the review period  an advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  will likely be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda at a public panel meeting as to whether the device should be approved 
companies are typically requested to make a presentation at the public panel meeting 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory panel 
toward the end of the pre market approval review process  the fda will generally conduct an inspection of the manufacturer s facilities to ensure that the facilities are in compliance with applicable good manufacturing practice requirements  which are outlined under fda s quality system regulation 
if the fda s evaluations of both the pre market approval application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pre market approval application 
when and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the fda  the agency will complete the third major step by issuing a pre market approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications 
if the fda s evaluations of the pre market approval application or manufacturing facilities are not favorable  the fda will deny approval of the pre market approval application or issue a not approvable letter 
the fda may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary  in which case pre market approval may be delayed for several years while additional clinical trials are conducted and submitted in an amendment to the pre market approval application 
the pre market approval process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which fda approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing 
modifications to a device that is the subject of a pre market approval  its labeling  or manufacturing process may require approval by the fda of pre market approval supplements or new pre market approval applications 
supplements to a pre market approval application often require the submission of the same type of information required for an initial pre market approval application  except that the supplement is generally limited to that information needed to support the proposed change from the product covered in the original pre market approval application

as part of the approval process  we were inspected in october by the fda to verify our compliance with good manufacturing practices requirements 
the final step in the approval process  the issuance of a letter by the fda approving the application  occurred on february  in september  we received pre market approval for the gen cvx laser 
in march and december  we received pre market approval of modifications to the operating software for the cvx we cannot assure that the fda will approve our current or future pre market approval applications or supplements on a timely basis or at all 
the absence of such approvals could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate future revenues

any products we manufacture or distribute pursuant to fda approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the fda  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the ffdca requires devices to be manufactured in accordance with quality system regulation requirements  
table of contents which impose certain process  procedure and documentation requirements upon us with respect to product development  manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
we have developed systems and controls that we believe will enable us to comply with quality system regulation requirements  however  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain compliance with these requirements 
in addition  the medical device reporting  or mdr  regulation obligates us to inform the fda whenever there is reasonable evidence to suggest that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury  or when one of our devices malfunctions and  if the malfunction were to recur  the device would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury 
there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with our determinations as to whether particular incidents meet the threshold for mdr reporting 
labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses 
noncompliance with requirements under the ffdca or accompanying regulations can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant pre market approval  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by us 
international sales of our products are subject to foreign regulations  including health and medical safety regulations 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging and labeling requirements  and import restrictions on devices 
exports of products that have been approved by the fda do not require fda authorization for export 
however  foreign countries often require a fda certificate to foreign government verifying that the product complies with ffdca requirements 
to obtain a certificate to foreign government  the device manufacturer must certify to the fda that the product has been granted approval in the united states and that the manufacturer and the exported products are in substantial compliance with the ffdca and all applicable or pertinent regulations 
the fda may refuse to issue a certificate to foreign government if significant outstanding quality system regulation violations exist 
we are subject to certain federal  state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous substance controls  among others 
to date  compliance with such environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position 
see risk factors regulatory compliance is expensive and can often be denied or significantly delayed set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations filed herewith 
competition methods for the treatment of cardiovascular disease are numerous and we expect them to increase in number 
almost all of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
consequently  we expect intense competition to continue in the marketplace 
although our excimer laser technology does not compete directly with stents and balloon angioplasty catheters  direct competition comes from manufacturers of atherectomy and thrombectomy devices 
in the lead removal market  we compete worldwide with lead removal devices manufactured by cook vascular inc and we compete in europe with devices manufactured by vascomed 
we estimate that approximately of coronary interventions involve the placement of a stent 
the leading stent providers in the united states are scimed life systems  inc a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation  cordis corporation a subsidiary of johnson johnson interventional systems  guidant corporation  medtronic  inc and jomed nv the leading balloon angioplasty manufacturers are scimed  cordis  guidant and medtronic 
manufacturers of atherectomy or thrombectomy devices include scimed  guidant and possis medical  inc 
table of contents we believe that the primary competitive factors in the interventional cardiovascular market are the ability to treat a variety of lesions safely and effectively  the impact of managed care practices and procedure costs  ease of use  size and effectiveness of sales forces  and research and development capabilities 
for more information  see risk factors we may be unable to compete successfully with bigger companies in our highly competitive industry set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations filed herewith 
patents and proprietary rights we hold issued united states patents  four issued patents in each of france  germany  italy and the netherlands and two issued patents in japan 
also  we have four united states patent applications pending and foreign patent applications pending 
any patents for which we have applied may not be granted 
furthermore  our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage 
our patents could be challenged as invalid or circumvented by competitors 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we could be adversely affected if any of our licensors terminates our licenses to use patented technology 
we do not have patents in any foreign countries other than those listed above 
it is our policy to require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
each agreement provides that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the relationship will be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances 
in the case of employees  the agreements provide that all inventions developed by the individual shall be our exclusive property  other than inventions unrelated to our business and developed entirely on the employee s own time 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
we also rely on trade secrets and unpatented know how to protect our proprietary technology and may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is time consuming  expensive  unpredictable and could divert the efforts of our management 
an adverse ruling could subject us to significant liability  require us to seek licenses and restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products 
see further discussion in part i  item legal proceedings 
we hold several non exclusive  royalty bearing license agreements for patents covering basic areas of laser technology 
in addition  we acquired an exclusive  royalty bearing license for a proprietary catheter coating 
additional licenses held by us include an exclusive license to patents covering laser assisted lead removal  an exclusive license relating to certain aspects of excimer laser technology in our products  and licenses to various patents on fluid core catheters 
research and development from inception through  our primary emphasis in research and development was on the cvx laser unit 
since  our research and development efforts have focused on refinement of the cvx laser unit and laser device technology 
we are also exploring additional applications for the cvx laser unit and are developing advanced laser devices designed to facilitate greater use in existing applications 

table of contents our team of research scientists  engineers and technicians performs substantially all of our research and development activities 
our research and development expense  which also includes clinical studies and regulatory costs  totaled  in   in  and  in we expect these costs to increase in as we advance clinical research focused on saphenous vein grafts and heart attack combined with increased product development activities 
the decreased costs in are a result of the substantial completion in of clinical trial enrollment and follow up in the laci and pela clinical trials 
in  we developed clinical trial protocols and initiated feasibility studies in the area of heart attacks and began enrollment in the saphenous vein graft trial coral during the second half of as a result  clinical studies costs decreased in compared with regulatory and research and development expenses in were consistent with amounts spent in manufacturing we assemble and test substantially all of our product line and have vertically integrated a number of processes in an effort to provide increased quality and reliability of the components used in the production process 
many of the processes are proprietary and were developed by us 
we believe that our level of manufacturing integration allows us to control costs  quality and process advancements  to accelerate new product development cycle time and to provide greater design flexibility 
raw materials  components and subassemblies used in our products are purchased from outside suppliers and are generally readily available from multiple sources 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities  including quality system regulations compliance inspections by the fda and t v  which is the european governing body equivalent to the fda 
we have undergone nine inspections by the fda for quality system regulations compliance since  and the t v has conducted an inspection each year since each inspection resulted in a limited number of noted observations  to which we believe we have provided adequate responses 
we purchase certain components of our cvx laser unit from several sole source suppliers 
we do not have guaranteed commitments from these suppliers  as we order products through purchase orders placed with these suppliers from time to time 
while we believe we could obtain replacement components from alternative suppliers  we may be unable to do so 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of laser units and disposable devices and hiring and training additional qualified manufacturing personnel 
any of these difficulties could lead to quarterly fluctuations in operating results and adversely affect us 
third party reimbursement our cvx laser unit and related fiber optic laser devices are generally purchased by hospitals  which then bill various third party payers for the health care services provided to their patients 
these payers include medicare  medicaid and private insurance payers 
most public and private insurance payers base their payment systems upon the medicare program 
the medicare program reimburses hospitals based on predetermined amounts per diagnosis code for inpatient hospital services those lasting hours or more and predetermined amounts per procedure performed for outpatient hospital services those lasting less than hours  and it reimburses physicians based on a fee schedule per procedure performed 
at present  many of our customers using the cvx for laser atherectomy are obtaining reimbursement for inpatient hospital services under an atherectomy code 
lead removal procedures using the sls are reimbursed using the same inpatient hospital codes for non laser lead removal or lead removal and replacement 
hospital outpatient codes and physician services codes differentiate atherectomy procedures from pci procedures utilizing only balloons or only balloons and stents 
reimbursement amounts are generally adequate to cover the cost of laser ablation procedures 
procedure costs and payment rates vary depending on the complexity of the procedure  various patient factors and geographical location 

table of contents while we believe that a laser atherectomy procedure offers a less costly alternative for the treatment of certain types of heart disease  we cannot assure that the procedure will be viewed as cost effective under changing reimbursement guidelines or other health care payment systems 
for more information  see risk factors failure of third parties to reimburse medical providers for our products may reduce our sales set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations filed herewith 
product liability and insurance our business entails the risk of product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of  per occurrence with an annual aggregate maximum of  we cannot assure  however  that product liability claims will not exceed such insurance coverage limits or that such insurance coverage limits will continue to be available on acceptable terms  or at all

item legal proceedings in december  we settled a dispute over royalties payable to one of our licensors  interlase lp  which has been in receivership since september under the supervision of a state court in virginia 
in march  interlase filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia claiming spectranetics breached a patent license agreement entered into in and infringed the patents that are the subject of the license agreement 
in the complaint  interlase claimed an amount in controversy in excess of million  exclusive of interest and costs  in addition to certain other forms of relief 
the claims for relief all related to royalties allegedly owed to or due interlase in the future associated with lead removal products and certain service revenue 
on may   the united states district court for eastern district of virginia granted spectranetics motion and entered an order transferring the case titled interlase limited partnership v 
the spectranetics corporation  civil no 
cv  to the united states district court for the district of colorado for all proceedings 

table of contents as a result of the settlement agreement executed in december  all litigation relating to the interlase matter has been dismissed in exchange for a one time payment from spectranetics to interlase of  no past or future royalties are due on lead removal products 
no future royalties are due on service revenue provided they do not exceed a certain percentage of total royalty bearing revenue 
the original license agreement entered into in was unchanged as a result of the settlement agreement 
in july   spectranetics filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of colorado against dr 
peter rentrop  which spectranetics amended in september   seeking declaratory relief that spectranetics products do not infringe any claims of dr 
rentrop s united states patent no 
 the patent  the claims of the patent are invalid and unenforceable  and in the event that the court finds that the claims of the patent to be valid and enforceable  that spectranetics is  through its employees  a joint owner of any invention claimed in the patent 
spectranetics also brought claims against dr 
rentrop for damages based upon dr 
rentrop s misappropriation of spectranetics trade secrets  breach of the parties confidentiality agreement  and wrongful taking of spectranetics confidential and proprietary information 
on january   the united states patent and trademark office issued to dr rentrop a continuation patent to the patent  united states patent no 
 the patent 
on the same day  dr 
rentrop filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  a complaint for patent infringement against spectranetics  under the patent the new york case 
on january   the court in colorado granted dr 
rentrop s motion to dismiss the amended complaint in colorado on the basis that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over dr 
rentrop  a resident of new york 
spectranetics decided to forgo appealing that decision  thus  there no longer is any case pending in colorado 
on march   spectranetics filed its answer  affirmative defenses and counterclaims against dr 
rentrop in the new york case 
spectranetics claim is that  in connection with consultation services provided to spectranetics by dr 
rentrop  spectranetics provided dr 
rentrop with confidential and proprietary information concerning certain of spectranetics laser catheter technology 
rather than keeping such information confidential as required by agreement with spectranetics  dr 
rentrop used the information to file patent applications associated with the and patents  which incorporate and claim inventions to which spectranetics personnel contributed significantly and materially  if not exclusively  thus entitling spectranetics personnel to designation at least as co inventors 
spectranetics also seeks declaratory judgments of non infringement  invalidity and unenforceability of the patents in suit  and has alleged counterclaims against dr 
rentrop for breach of confidentiality agreement  misappropriation of trade secrets  and conversion 
the new york case is still in a very preliminary stage 
while spectranetics intends to vigorously litigate these claims  it is not adverse to a process whereby those claims may be favorably terminated at an early stage 
the company is involved in legal proceedings in the normal course of business and does not expect them to have a material adverse effect on our business

corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive surgical procedures within the cardiovascular system in conjunction with our proprietary excimer laser system 
excimer laser technology delivers comparatively cool ultraviolet light in short  controlled energy pulses to ablate or remove tissue 
our excimer laser system includes the cvx laser unit and various fiber optic delivery devices  including disposable catheters and sheaths 
our excimer laser system is the only excimer laser system approved in the united states and europe for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular applications 
our excimer laser system is used in complex atherectomy procedures to open clogged or 
table of contents obstructed arteries in the coronary vascular system 
it is also used to remove lead wires from patients with implanted pacemakers or cardioverter defibrillators  which are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
we believe the excimer laser is particularly well suited to treat thrombus laden lesions and have initiated clinical research for a laser based treatment of saphenous vein grafts and acute myocardial infarction  or heart attack 
our business strategy is to develop additional applications for our excimer laser  gather and develop clinical data for publication in peer reviewed medical journals  increase utilization of our fda approved products  and continue to expand our installed base of laser systems  which totals as of december  in  the fda approved for commercialization our cvx laser system and the first generation of our fiber optic coronary atherectomy catheters 
several improvements and additions to our coronary angioplasty product line have been made since and have been approved for commercialization by the fda 
in  we secured fda approval to use our excimer laser system for removal of pacemaker and defibrillator leads  and we secured fda approval in to market our product for use in restenosed clogged stents thin steel mesh tubes used to support the walls of coronary arteries as a pretreatment prior to brachytherapy radiation therapy 
in  we completed two clinical trials evaluating the use of our excimer laser system to treat blocked arteries in leg 
the pela trial enrolled patients in a randomized trial comparing excimer laser treatment followed with balloon angioplasty to balloon angioplasty alone 
the trial was designed to test the safety and efficacy of treating total occlusions blockages of at least centimeters in length within the superficial femoral artery sfa 
the trial was designed to show superiority of the laser group over the balloon only group 
the clinical results showed equivalence in most study endpoints  including the primary endpoint  which was primary patency the degree in which the artery is open as measured by diameter stenosis blockage at one year by ultrasound with no reintervention 
the largest catheters used in the trial were mm in diameter as compared to vessel sizes treated in excess of mm in diameter 
we believe that the low catheter diameter in relation to vessel diameter adversely affected results and we are now evaluating product development opportunities for larger catheter diameters 
we are currently evaluating our regulatory strategy as to the pela data 
we may or may not submit the data to the fda requesting approval 
on january   spectranetics received fda approval to begin phase of the laci trial  which deals with multi vessel peripheral vascular disease in patients presenting with critical limb ischemia cli 
patients with cli have severe circulatory disease resulting in resting leg pain  non healing ulcers of the foot or lower leg  or gangrenous areas that are likely candidates for amputation rutherford categories   and 
frequently  these patients also suffer from coronary artery disease  hypertension and diabetes 
the phase trial enrolled patients at domestic and several european sites 
the primary endpoint of phase is limb salvage ie  freedom from major amputation for a month follow up period 
the last patient enrolled in the laci trial in april and the six month follow up phase was completed in october data from the trial indicated a success rate as compared with in the historical control group of patients treated with a variety of standard therapies  including bypass surgery 
there were no statistical differences in serious adverse events between the laci group and the historical control group 
we submitted the clinical data from the laci trial to the fda in january and an advisory panel to the fda reviewed our submission at a panel meeting on october  although the clinical trial endpoints were achieved  the panel recommended non approval  citing concerns over the non randomized nature of the trial  use of a historical control group  and the inability to distinguish the specific benefit of laser treatment  since it was used adjunctively with balloons and stents 
the fda  which generally follows the advisory panel s recommendation  issued a non approval letter following the panel meeting 
based on input at the advisory panel meeting and subsequent discussions with the fda  we are pursuing clearance to market our products to patients who have total occlusions that are not crossable with a guidewire  which is a subset of the laci data 
on january   we submitted data on patients that showed a limb salvage rate ie  no major amputations among surviving patients six months after the procedure 
the data consisted of patients from the laci trial supplemented with an additional patients treated at two other sites that were not part of the original laci trial but followed the laci trial protocol 
based on fda input  the application was submitted as a k 
table of contents application as compared to a pre market approval pma supplement submitted along with the original laci application 
the k application is a less rigorous review cycle and has a day response time compared with days for a pma supplement 
the response could be additional questions from the fda or a definitive answer 
if the response consists of additional questions  the day review cycle begins again with our response to the questions 
we submitted this data to the fda in january and it showed that the limb salvage rate among the patients treated was for those patients surviving six months following the procedure 
there was no difference in serious adverse events as compared with the entire set of patients treated in the laci trial 
although we believe the data we have submitted supports fda clearance  there are no assurances that fda clearance will be received 
net income was  or 
per diluted share for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of  or 
per diluted share for the year ended december  excluding costs of  associated with the proxy contest and settlement obligations  income was  for the year ended december  our financial guidance for is for revenue growth in the range of five percent to seven percent compared with  driven primarily by increased disposable product sales and reflecting to new laser placements 
net income is projected to be in the range of  to  however  there are no assurances that these results will be achieved 
our financial guidance assumes no revenue contribution from the treatment of total occlusions in patients with critical limb ischemia 
however  it does reflect costs associated with the hiring of at least three new clinical account managers and the advancement of clinical research focused on a laser based treatment of heart attacks 
product line revenue overview in thousands laser equipment disposables repair and maintenance other  net of provision for sales returns total other revenue consists of sales of custom products offset by a provision for sales returns 
custom products sales in and consisted primarily of coated wire used by a single customer as a component of a medical device it sells to its customers 
the customer moved this business to another supplier in which resulted in the declining revenue in noted in the above table 

table of contents geographical results of operations overview revenue in thousands united states europe total net income loss in thousands united states europe total includes  of costs associated with proxy contest and settlement obligations

equipment revenue of  declined in compared with primarily as a result of a change in focus away from equipment sales and towards disposable product sales 
equipment revenue was affected by the july adoption of the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which modified our revenue recognition policy for the sale of laser equipment by requiring the retail value of service provided during the one year warranty period to be treated as a separate unit of accounting 
accordingly  the retail value of service provided during the warranty period  annually is deducted from the invoiced price of the laser system and recorded as deferred revenue which is recognized as revenue on a straight line basis during the warranty period 
as a result of the adoption of this provision  equipment revenue in was reduced by  a discussion of eitf is provided in the new accounting pronouncements section of this document 
during the first quarter of  we re deployed three field sales employees dedicated to laser equipment sales as a result of the difficulties encountered in selling laser equipment 
these field sales resources were re deployed to focus on the sale of disposable products  which is a higher margin recurring revenue stream 
for the year ended december   we placed sold from inventory  rented or provided for evaluation excimer laser systems compared with in  bringing our total installed base of laser systems to in the united states 
we sold either an outright sale from inventory or a sale conversion from evaluation or rental programs laser systems during as compared with laser systems sold in laser units sold as a result of a sales conversion from an evaluation or rental program are not counted as a placement that increases the installed base since they were counted originally when the unit was placed as an evaluation or rental unit 
the decreased laser equipment revenue reflects lower unit sales of laser systems as a result of eliminating our dedicated equipment sales staff early in combined with a special price promotion on laser systems sold through september   which contributed to increased unit volumes in we expect that a stabilized annual laser equipment revenue level is in the range of  to  disposable products revenue  which primarily consists of single use catheter products  increased  or  compared with this was an important driver of our improved profitability since disposable product gross margins generally range from 
disposable product sales consist of two main product lines atherectomy and lead removal 
our atherectomy revenue was essentially flat compared with and totaled  for the year ended december  this follows two consecutive years of declining revenue within this segment 
we believe this business has stabilized as a result of our focused sales efforts on treating saphenous vein grafts  total occlusions  and in stent restenosis prior to brachytherapy 
table of contents radiation treatment 
furthermore  we believe the clinical research we have initiated in the area of saphenous vein grafts and acute myocardial infarction has elevated our profile among our physician customers which has led to new institutions willing to revisit their use of our excimer laser technology 
our lead removal revenue increased  or  to  in compared with the launch of our second generation laser sheath in late contributed to this growth  which was driven by unit volume increases 
additionally  the market for implantable defibrillators has grown and is expected to grow in the future as a result of clinical research recently completed madit and scd heft clinical trials that expand the patient pool eligible for implantable defibrillators 
the results of the madit clinical trial became available in and the scd heft clinical trial results were made public in february growth in the implantable defibrillator market may accelerate  depending on the establishment of referral patterns to electrophysiologists for this expanded patient pool and whether or not reimbursement will be established for the hospitals and electrophysiologists who treat these patients 
generally  growth in the implantable defibrillator market contributes to growth in our lead removal business  since the leads attached to the implantable defibrillator are larger in diameter and there are more leads attached to the current generation of implantable defibrillators 
for patients who already have a pacemaker or defibrillator with leads attached  this causes a space problem in the vein and enhances the potential for electrical cross talk between the leads 
therefore  the old leads are more likely to be removed in this situation 
although we expect our lead removal business to continue to grow  there can be no assurances to that effect 
the standard of care in this market is to cap leads and leave them behind rather than lead removal 
we have initiated programs to examine the costs and frequency of complications associated with abandoned leads  but there are no assurances that these programs will be successful or will change the current standard of care 
service revenue increased four percent in  due to the larger installed base of the company s excimer laser systems 
fluctuation in euro currency rates in relation to the us dollar during the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   caused an increase in consolidated revenue of  or approximately one percent 
the provision for sales returns  which is recorded as a reduction in revenue and relates to estimated product returns  for the years ended december  and  was  and  respectively 
as a result  revenue increased  the provision for sales returns decline in compared with is due to a decreased rate of historical product returns 
gross margin increased to percent in  from percent in this increase was due to a shift in product mix to a higher proportion of disposable product revenue  which generate higher margins than laser equipment and service revenue 
operating expenses were  in compared with  in operating expenses  excluding proxy contest and settlement obligations of  were  selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to  in from  in  due to the following selling expenses increased approximately  primarily as a result of the explanation below 
we expect selling expenses to increase in since we have hired three additional clinical trainers 
two additional clinical training employees were hired in as compared with  which resulted in increased costs of approximately approximately  of increased costs are associated with unfavorable exchange rate fluctuations of the us dollar in relation to the euro  which is the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiary  spectranetics international  bv general and administrative expenses increased approximately  in as compared with last year as a result of increased incentive compensation to senior and mid level management arising from the achievement of financial goals set at the beginning of we also expect general and administrative costs to increase in as a result of inflation and consulting costs associated with 
table of contents sarbanes oxley compliance estimated between  and 
incentive compensation may increase dependent on achievement of corporate financial objectives 
research  development and other technology expense includes research and development  clinical studies  regulatory  and royalties expenses 
this category of expenses declined  or percent  in to  the overall decrease is primarily due to a  decrease in clinical studies as a result of the completion of the pela and laci clinical studies in late royalty expenses declined  due to product mix changes laser equipment revenue declined in and bears a higher royalty rate than disposable product revenue which increased in 
proxy contest charges and settlement obligations totaled  during further discussion of these costs is contained in the footnotes to our financial statements 
other income of  relates primarily to interest income and is down from  in the decline is a result of declining interest yields on our interest bearing investment securities  which consist of money market accounts  highly rated commercial paper and government backed investment securities 
net income was  in  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of  or per diluted share  in excluding proxy contest charges and settlement obligations incurred in  income would have been  year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenue in was  up  or one percent  from the increase is due to a percent increase in equipment revenue and a two percent increase in service revenue 
disposable catheter revenue in was consistent with levels 
equipment revenue increased percent primarily as a result of increased laser sales resulting from a  special price promotion  which ended september  for the year ended december   we placed sold from inventory  rented or provided for evaluation excimer laser systems compared with in  bringing our total installed base of laser systems to in the united states 
we sold either an outright sale from inventory or a sale conversion from evaluation or rental programs laser systems during as compared with laser systems sold in note that laser units sold as a result of a sales conversion from an evaluation or rental program are not counted as a placement that increases the installed base since they were counted originally when the unit was placed as an evaluation or rental unit 
disposable products revenue  which primarily consists of single use catheter products  was essentially unchanged from a three percent increase in revenue from lead removal devices was offset by a three percent decline in coronary atherectomy catheters 
the decline in coronary atherectomy catheters reflects large orders during the first nine months of from several accounts 
we have not observed decreased catheter utilization in these accounts and expect them to re order as inventory levels are reduced 
service revenue increased two percent in  due to the larger installed base of the company s excimer laser systems 
gross margin decreased to percent in  from percent in this decrease was due to a shift in product mix to a higher proportion of excimer laser systems  which generate lower margins than disposable products and service revenue  especially during the  special price promotion 
operating expenses  excluding proxy contest charges and settlement obligations of  were  compared with  in selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent to  from  in  due to the following selling expenses increased approximately  primarily as a result of the following four additional field sales employees were hired in as compared with  which resulted in increased costs of approximately  
table of contents approximately  was spent in to prepare for the launch of our products to treat critical limb ischemia 
these costs include the hiring of a dedicated product manager  consulting costs to explore medicare medicaid reimbursement issues  and creative concepts related to the development of marketing materials 
no costs of this nature were incurred in approximately  of physician training costs due to a higher number of physicians trained compared with last year for use of our technology in coronary atherectomy and lead removal procedures 
general and administrative expenses decreased approximately  in as compared with last year as a result of the following approximately  related to reduced personnel costs associated with the termination of the company s president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and vice president  corporate relations during the second quarter of approximately  associated with reduced legal expenses due to the settlement of litigation with cook vascular  inc in no litigation costs of this nature were incurred during research  development and other technology expense includes research and development  clinical studies  regulatory  and royalties expenses 
this category of expenses declined  or eight percent  in to  the overall decrease is primarily due to a decrease in clinical studies as a result of reduced costs associated with the lars trial  which was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of these costs were partially offset by increased costs associated with the clinical trials to treat peripheral leg arteries which were both completed in late proxy contest charges and settlement obligations totaled  during further discussion of these costs is contained in footnote to our financial statements 
interest income decreased percent to  due primarily to lower yields on our investment securities  which consist primarily of us government and agency obligations with original maturities of less than two years 
interest expense of  compares with  in and relates primarily to the discount calculated on the settlement obligation for patent infringement litigation concluded in the final payment on this settlement obligation was made in november net loss was  in  or per diluted share  compared with net income of  or per diluted share  in excluding proxy contest charges and settlement obligations  income would have been  or per diluted share 
income taxes at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which are available to offset future federal taxable income  if any  and expire at varying dates from through the annual use of the net operating loss carryforwards is limited under section of the internal revenue code of an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of  is available to offset future tax liabilities and has no expiration date 
the company also has tax loss carryforwards in the netherlands  which have no expiration date  of approximately million euros million us dollars available to offset future taxable income  if any 
we also had research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards for federal income tax purposes at december   of approximately million  which are available to reduce future federal income taxes  if any  and expire at varying dates through the annual use of portions of the research and experimentation credit carryforwards is also limited under section of the internal revenue code of we have generated significant operating losses from inception to date  the income tax impact of which has not been reflected in our financial statements 
deferred tax assets are recognized when it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 
we will need to generate taxable income to recognize available not operating losses in the future 

table of contents the company has provided a valuation allowance offsetting its deferred tax assets as management believes  based on current information  that realizability is not more likely than not 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities of  an increase of  from  at december  in addition  we had classified  and  as restricted cash at december  and  respectively since it was in an escrow account pending resolution of our dispute with interlase see part i  item legal proceedings for further discussion 
since the dispute has been resolved  the amounts from the escrow account have been disbursed to us during the quarter ending on march  cash and cash equivalents were  at december  compared with  at december   an increase of  for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities totaled  these positive cash flows were driven primarily by net income and we expect net income to be the primary driver of future cash flows provided by operating activities 
net income guidance for is a range between  and  other potential uses of cash include growth in accounts receivable as a result of revenue growth and growth in the equipment held for rental or loan account as a result of expanding placement activity of our laser systems through evaluation or rental programs 
we continue to stay focused on the management of accounts receivable as measured by days sales outstanding and will continue this focus in with the goal of maintaining the current level of days sales outstanding  although there can be no assurances this goal will be achieved 
for the equipment held for rental or loan account  this account increases or decreases based on the level of evaluation or rental laser placements offset by sales of laser systems previously placed under evaluation or rental programs 
we continue to expect the majority of our laser placement activity in to be in the form of evaluation or rental units 
for the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities was  the increased cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to proceeds from the maturity of investment securities that were reinvested in cash equivalents 
this was partially offset by capital expenditures during the year ended december   of  capital expenditures for the year ended december  were  we expect an increase of at least  in capital expenditures compared with net cash provided by financing activities was  during the year ended december  financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from sale of common stock to employees or former employees  primarily through the exercise of stock options but also as a result of stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by principal payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations 
at december   there was no debt or capital lease obligations 
in october  we funded an escrow account in connection with a dispute with one of our licensors 
the licensor claimed that additional royalties totaling million were due relating to lead removal products and other service based revenue 
the licensor threatened to seek an injunction to prohibit us from selling lead removal devices 
the dispute was resolved in december through the one time payment to the licensor  interlase  of  no changes were made to the original license agreement entered into in as a result of the settlement 
the settlement was finalized on december  funds from the escrow account were released to spectranetics in march at december  and  we had placed a number of systems on rental or loan programs 
a total of  and  was recorded as equipment held for rental or loan at december  and  respectively  and is being depreciated over three to five years  depending on whether the laser system is new or remanufactured 
in  we used two placement programs in addition to the sale of laser systems evergreen rental program this rental program was introduced in july rental revenue under this program varies on a sliding scale depending on the customer s catheter purchases each month 

table of contents rental revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized upon invoicing 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within cost of sales based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit 
as of december   laser units were in place under the evergreen program 
evaluation programs we loan a laser system to an institution for use over a short period of time  usually three to six months 
the loan of the equipment is to create awareness of our products and their capabilities  and no revenue is earned or recognized in connection with the placement of a loaned laser although sales of disposable products result from the laser placement 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expense based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit 
as of december   laser units were in place under the evaluation program 
at the beginning of  we ran a price promotion in which we offered lasers for sale at  compared with a list price of  the  price promotion ended september   however  we continued to honor special pricing for quotes that were outstanding as of september  we believe our liquidity and capitalization as of december  are sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through december  contractual obligations the company leases office space  furniture and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with initial terms that expire at various dates through purchase obligations consist of purchase orders issued primarily for inventory 
the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases and purchase obligations as of december  are as follows total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations total conversion to the euro for the year ended december   spectranetics international  bv  used the euro as its functional currency 
the euro was adopted as its functional currency on january  the conversion to the euro did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those relating to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  royalty obligations  reorganization costs  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped and title transfers to the customer 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period 

table of contents revenue from the rental of our excimer laser systems is recognized on a monthly basis based on a calculated rental fee 
for evergreen rental units  the calculated rental fee depends on the monthly catheter purchases of each customer 
in july  we adopted the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which modified our revenue recognition policy for the sale of laser equipment 
the primary impact of the new pronouncement is to treat service provided during the one year warranty period as a separate unit of accounting 
as such  the retail value of this service is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the warranty period 
revenue is recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations in the sales contract  which includes installation of the laser system and physician training 
prior to july   revenue for the sale of laser equipment was recognized upon shipment 
allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based on historical experience 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change 
warranty liability 
we generally provide a one year warranty on the sale of our excimer laser 
through june   we recorded warranty expense for the one year warranty period as cost of revenue at the time of sale 
warranty expense is an estimate based on historical experience related to warranty repairs 
as warranty costs are incurred  they are charged against the warranty liability 
as a result of eitf  which became effective july   warranty costs incurred for lasers sold after this date are recorded as expense in the period incurred 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
we have recorded a loss contingency of approximately million related primarily to a disagreement with one of our existing licensors  edwards life sciences edwards 
we have accrued an estimated loss contingency based on the status of negotiations with edwards 
there can be no assurances the loss contingency will be adequate 
the disagreement centers around the treatment of revenues attributed to training services we provide to our customers 
we do not believe these revenues are within the scope of the license agreement and edwards disagrees 
in the event the disagreement is not resolved through our ongoing negotiations  our license agreement with edwards contains an arbitration provision to settle the disagreement 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based compensation plans for employees in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
as such  compensation expense is recorded on the date of grant only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the market price 
no compensation cost has been recognized for original stock option grants to employees in the accompanying financial statements as all options granted had an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 entities are permitted to recognize as expense the fair value of all stock based awards on the date of grant over the vesting period 
alternatively  sfas no 
also allows entities to continue to apply the provisions of apb and provide pro forma earnings loss and pro forma earnings loss per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value based method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
the company has elected to continue to apply the provisions of apb and provide the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 

table of contents we account for nonemployee stock based awards in accordance with sfas no 
and related interpretations 
we calculate compensation expense for the disclosures required by sfas no 
through the use of the black scholes option pricing model  which incorporates assumptions as to volatility and expected option terms  among others 
should these underlying assumptions change  the calculated compensation expense could be materially different 
compensation expense as calculated under a fair value based model has historically been material to our financial statements 
for the years ended december   and  compensation expense related to stock option grants to employees totaled   and  respectively  which have been included in pro forma disclosures  but not included in determining net income loss 
as such  our statement of operations would be adversely affected should new accounting pronouncements be adopted that require the recording of compensation expense within our statement of operations 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is required to the extent it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax asset of  we have established a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realization because of our history of operating losses and lack of significant profits generated in should we demonstrate consistent and continued profitability  the valuation allowance will be evaluated and a deferred tax asset may be recorded within our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus defines the accounting for arrangements that include multiple deliverables and provides guidance on how the arrangement consideration should be measured  whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting and that the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair value  if applicable 
once the arrangement is separated into units of accounting  applicable revenue recognition should be applied to each separate unit of accounting 
the pronouncement was effective july  and is applied prospectively by the company 
the primary impact of the new pronouncement is to treat service provided during the one year warranty period as a separate unit of accounting 
as such  the retail value of this service is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the warranty period 
additionally  the company s revenue recognition policy as it relates to laser equipment sales was modified so that revenue is recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations in the sales contract  which includes installation of the laser system and physician training 
prior to july   revenue for the sale of laser equipment was recognized upon shipment 
risk factors we have a history of losses and may not be able to maintain profitability 
we incurred losses from operations since our inception in june until the second quarter of  and we incurred net losses in the first and second quarters of at december   we had accumulated million in net losses since inception 
we expect that our research  development and clinical trial activities and regulatory approvals  together with future selling  general and administrative activities and the costs associated with launching our products for additional indications will result in significant expenses for the foreseeable future 
although we 
table of contents have been profitable for six consecutive quarters  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain profitability in the future 
regulatory compliance is expensive and can often be denied or significantly delayed 
the industry in which we compete is subject to extensive regulation by the fda and comparable state and foreign agencies 
complying with these regulations is costly and time consuming 
international regulatory approval processes may take longer than the fda approval process 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we may be subject to fines  suspensions or revocations of approvals  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions  criminal prosecutions and other penalties 
we may be unable to obtain future regulatory approval in a timely manner  or at all  if existing regulations are changed or new regulations are adopted 
for example  the fda approval process for the use of excimer laser technology in clearing blocked arteries in the leg has taken longer than we anticipated due to requests for additional clinical data and changes in regulatory requirements 
failures in clinical trials may hurt our business and our stock price 
all of spectranetics potential products are subject to extensive regulation and will require approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies prior to commercial sale 
the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in large clinical trials 
companies in the medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in various stages of clinical trials  even in advanced clinical trials  after apparently promising results had been obtained in earlier trials 
the development of safe and effective products is uncertain and subject to numerous risks 
the product development process may take several years  depending on the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product 
larger competitors are able to offer larger financial incentives to their customers to support their clinical trials 
enrollment in our clinical trials may be adversely affected by clinical trials financed by our larger competitors 
product candidates that may appear to be promising in development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective  take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  or require additional clinical data and testing 
we cannot guarantee that we will gain fda approval to market the use of our excimer laser system to treat blocked arteries in the leg 
if we do not receive these fda approvals  our business will suffer 
our small sales and marketing team may be unable to compete with our larger competitors or to reach all potential customers 
many of our competitors have larger sales and marketing operations than we do 
this allows those competitors to spend more time with potential customers and to focus on a larger number of potential customers  which gives them a significant advantage over our team in making sales 
our products may not achieve market acceptance 
excimer laser technology competes with more established therapies for restoring circulation to clogged or obstructed arteries such as balloon angioplasty and stent implantation 
market acceptance of the excimer laser system depends on our ability to provide adequate clinical and economic data that shows the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of  and patient benefits from  excimer laser atherectomy and lead removal 
we may be unable to compete successfully with bigger companies in our highly competitive industry 
our primary competitors are manufacturers of products used in competing therapies  such as balloon angioplasty  which uses a balloon to push obstructions out of the way  stent implantation  open chest bypass surgery  and atherectomy and thrombectomy  using mechanical methods to remove arterial blockages 

table of contents we also compete with companies marketing lead extraction devices or removal methods  such as mechanical sheaths 
in the lead removal market  we compete worldwide with lead removal devices manufactured by cook vascular inc and we compete in europe with devices manufactured by vascomed 
almost all of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
larger competitors have a broader product line  which enables them to offer customers bundled purchase contracts and quantity discounts 
we expect competition to intensify 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in the interventional cardiovascular market are the ability to treat a variety of lesions safely and effectively  the impact of managed care practices  related reimbursement to the health care provider  and procedure costs  ease of use  size and effectiveness of sales forces  and research and development capabilities 
we estimate that approximately percent of coronary interventions involve the placement of a stent 
the leading stent providers in the united states are scimed life systems  inc a subsidiary of boston scientific corporation  cordis corporation a subsidiary of johnson johnson interventional systems  guidant corporation  medtronic  inc  and jomed nv the leading balloon angioplasty manufacturers are scimed  cordis  guidant and medtronic 
manufacturers of atherectomy or thrombectomy devices include scimed  guidant and possis medical  inc laser placement is a barrier to accessing patient cases for which our disposable products may be suited 
many competing products do not require an up front investment in the form of a capital equipment purchase  lease  or rental 
failure of third parties to reimburse medical providers for our products may reduce our sales 
we sell our cvx laser unit primarily to hospitals  which then bill third party payers  such as government programs and private insurance plans  for the services the hospitals provide using the cvx laser unit 
unlike balloon angioplasty  laser atherectomy requires the purchase or lease of expensive capital equipment 
in some circumstances  the amount reimbursed to a hospital for procedures involving our products may not be adequate to cover a hospital s costs 
we do not believe that reimbursement has materially adversely affected our business to date  but continued cost containment measures by third party payers could hurt our business in the future 
in addition  the fda has required that the label for the cvx laser unit state that adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed together with laser atherectomy in most of the procedures we submitted to the fda for pre market approval 
adjunctive balloon angioplasty requires the purchase of a balloon catheter in addition to the laser catheter 
while all approved procedures using the excimer laser system are reimbursable  some third party payers attempt to deny reimbursement for procedures they believe are duplicative  such as adjunctive balloon angioplasty performed together with laser atherectomy 
third party payers may also attempt to deny reimbursement if they determine that a device used in a procedure was experimental  was used for a non approved indication  or was not used in accordance with established pay protocols regarding cost effective treatment methods 
hospitals that have experienced reimbursement problems or expect to experience reimbursement problems may not purchase our excimer laser systems 
technological change may result in our products becoming obsolete 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale or lease of the cvx laser unit  related disposable devices and service 
technological progress or new developments in our industry could adversely affect sales of our products 
many companies  some of which have substantially greater resources than we do  are engaged in research and development for the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease 
these include pharmaceutical approaches as well as development of new or improved angioplasty  atherectomy  thrombectomy or other 
table of contents devices 
our products could be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations in the treatment of vascular disease 
our european operations may not be successful or may not be able to achieve revenue growth 
in january we established a distributor relationship in germany  and now utilize distributors throughout most of europe 
the sales and marketing efforts on our behalf by distributors in europe could fail to attain long term success 
we are exposed to the problems that come from having international operations 
for the year ended december   our revenue from international operations represented percent of consolidated revenue 
changes in overseas economic conditions  war  currency exchange rates  foreign tax laws or tariffs or other trade regulations could adversely affect our ability to market our products in these and other countries 
the new product approval process in foreign countries is often complex and lengthy 
for example  the reimbursement approval process in japan has taken longer than anticipated due to the complexity of this process 
as we expand our international operations  we expect our sales and expenses denominated in foreign currencies to expand 
we have important sole source suppliers and may be unable to replace them if they stop supplying us 
we purchase certain components of our cvx laser unit from several sole source suppliers 
we do not have guaranteed commitments from these suppliers and order products through purchase orders placed with these suppliers from time to time 
while we believe that we could obtain replacement components from alternative suppliers  we may be unable to do so 
potential product liability claims and insufficient insurance coverage may hurt our business and stock price 
we are subject to risk of product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance with coverage and aggregate maximum amounts of  the coverage limits of our insurance policies may be inadequate  and insurance coverage with acceptable terms could be unavailable in the future 
our patents and proprietary rights may be proved invalid  which would enable competitors to copy our products  we may infringe other companies rights 
we hold patents and licenses to use patented technology  and have patent applications pending 
any patents we have applied for may not be granted 
in addition  our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to give us any competitive advantage 
our patents could be challenged as invalid or circumvented by competitors 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we do not have patents in many foreign countries 
we could be adversely affected if any of our licensors terminates our licenses to use patented technology 
we have received inquiries from two of our licensors regarding the level of past royalty payments 
we have settled one dispute and have recently engaged in discussions with the other regarding their inquiries 
the disagreement over past royalty payments centers on the treatment of certain service based revenue  including repair and maintenance  and physician and clinical training services 
we believe these services are beyond the scope of the license agreement 
if our discussions do not resolve the dispute  our license agreement with the licensor provides for arbitration proceedings to settle this matter 
we have accrued costs of million associated with the resolution of this matter  which represents our best estimate of costs to resolve the matter based on the status of ongoing discussions 
if the matter is referred to arbitration proceedings  we will vigorously defend our position that royalties are not owed on the service based revenues in dispute 
there may be patents and patent applications owned by others relating to laser and fiber optic technologies  which  if determined to be valid and enforceable  may be infringed by spectranetics 
holders of certain patents  including holders of patents involving the use of lasers in the body  may contact us and request that we enter into license agreements for the underlying technology 
for example  we have been made aware of a patent issued to dr 
peter rentrop for a certain catheter with a diameter of less than millimeters and are currently involved in litigation regarding this patent 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion of this litigation 
we are in the process of reviewing the patent to determine its validity and enforceability 
we cannot guarantee a patent holder will not file a lawsuit against us and prevail 
if we decide that we need to license technology  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on favorable terms or at all
