neon s shadow technology provides flexible  industry standard interfaces to enable highly secure and scalable mainframe integration allowing organizations to reduce total cost of ownership and risk associated with mainframe integration while streamlining the number of incumbent technologies needed for such integration 
during fiscal  neon began restructuring the company to concentrate on its core mainframe integration business  which has historically accounted for the majority of its revenues 
prior to fiscal  neon marketed and sold products outside of the mainframe integration market 
in august  neon terminated the distribution agreement for its enterprise subsystem management esm products  owned by neon enterprise software  inc formerly peregrine bridge transfer corporation  hereafter nesi

see management s discussion and analysis related party transactions and the notes to neon s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions 
business environment neon derives revenue from software licenses and maintenance services 
license fees  which are graduated and based upon various industry standard measures of product uses such as mainframe potential capacity  cpus  and users  are generally due upon license grant and include a one year maintenance period 
the sales process typically takes between six and nine months 
after the initial year of license  neon provides ongoing maintenance services  which include technical support and product enhancements  for an annual fee 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of  demand for  or market acceptance of  our products  such as competition or technological change  could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in mid  the mainframe software market began to weaken as the global economies entered a recessionary period 
prior to  many of neon s customers were experiencing consistent growth of their mainframe systems and  as a result  they purchased additional software capacity in anticipation of continued growth at rates consistent with history 
additionally  during this time frame  the competitive landscape for neon s product also began to intensify 
during fiscal  neon began restructuring the company to concentrate on its core mainframe integration business  which has historically accounted for the majority of its revenues 
neon divested of its non core products and reduced the size of its sales  marketing and administration organizations 
during this period neon also began to develop new mainframe integration products as well as identify other adjacent products  technologies and companies  complementary to neon s existing product portfolio 
many of neon s customers remain cautious about their capital spending 
although general economic conditions have improved  neon is still uncertain as to future spending patterns of its customers 
neon believes that period to period comparisons of our revenue and operating results should not be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
further  neon does not believe that its historical growth rates in prior years are necessarily representative of its future growth potential 
financial performance total revenue for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal total revenue in fiscal included  related to esm products  which we ceased to distribute in august during fiscal and  neon did not have any customers that individually accounted for or more of total revenue 
in fiscal and  maintenance revenues represented and of total revenues  respectively 
maintenance revenues may continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues in the future 
net loss for fiscal was  compared to million in the prior year 
neon s net loss during fiscal declined significantly as a result of the divesture of non core products in fiscal as well as other sales  marketing and administrative restructuring activities 
at march   neon had cash and cash equivalents of million  an increase of million from fiscal neon does not have any debt

woodhill  john j 
moores  peter schaeffer  charles e 
noell iii and jim woodhill  had or have a financial interest in scalable 
in june  neon obtained a two year option to acquire scalable as outlined in the agreement and plan of merger dated june  in connection with this option  neon agreed to provide bridge financing of up to million subsequently increased to million in october  in addition to million previously loaned to scalable that was secured by personal guarantees from john j 
moores  louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill 
the aggregate financing had a month term and did not bear interest during the term of the two year option to acquire scalable  which expires june  after the expiration of the option  the loan was scheduled to bear interest at the prime rate plus two percentage points to its due date of june  and thereafter on any unpaid principal and interest amounts outstanding 
in addition to the personal guarantees of john j 
moores  louis r 
woodhill and jim woodhill for the initial million loaned to scalable  the million loan was secured by all of the intellectual property rights of scalable 
as of january  scalable had exhausted its credit facility with neon 
scalable has asked for and received waivers of neon s right of first refusal with respect to additional venture capital bridge financing 
on june   neon entered into a note purchase agreement with jmi services  inc  the largest shareholder of scalable  to sell the million guaranteed note and the million secured note issued by scalable to neon for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
jmi services is an affiliate of john j 
moores  neon s largest shareholder 
the proposed purchase of the scalable notes was reviewed by neon s fully independent board of directors 
the board requested and received a fairness opinion from avail consulting  inc  a houston  texas based independent valuation and financial consultant  stating that the transaction was fair to the stockholders of neon from a financial standpoint 
neon also engaged avail consulting to perform a valuation on both notes receivable from scalable 
the value received by jmi services exceeded the estimated fair value of both notes  as determined by avail consulting 
during the period in which neon was advancing funds to scalable  neon accounted for its investment in scalable using the modified equity method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  neon recognized of scalable s losses to the extent of advances made in excess of the guaranteed amount 
at march   neon had made total advances of million to scalable including million of unguaranteed advances and recognized cumulative losses of million 
no losses have been recognized in fiscal year since neon has no further obligation to advance funds to scalable and have subsequently sold the notes in question 
due to the uncertainties regarding neon s ultimate ability to recover any unguaranteed advances to scalable  neon had previously determined that it should not record the carrying value of its net advance to scalable above the guaranteed amount of million 
neon currently anticipates that the sale of the scalable notes to jmi services  inc will result in a gain of approximately million on sale of assets in the fiscal quarter ending june  critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of the accounting policies that neon believes are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition policies statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  was issued in october by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa and was amended by statement of position sop and statement of position sop 
neon adopted sop effective july   sop effective march  and sop effective april  neon believes its current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with sop  sop and sop revenues from software license sales are recognized when all of the following conditions are met a non cancelable license agreement has been obtained  the product has been delivered  there are no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  collection of the receivable is probable  no other significant vendor obligations exist  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to each element of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price generally charged when an element is sold separately 
all elements of each order are valued at the time of revenue recognition 
neon will defer license revenue for all delivered elements associated with a sales arrangement  if vendor specific objective evidence cannot be established for each undelivered element 
license revenues generally include software maintenance agreements for the first year following the date of sale 
in such cases  revenues are allocated between license and maintenance revenues based on the residual method provided by sop deferred revenue is generally based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of maintenance with the remaining portion of the total arrangement value allocated to license revenues 
revenues from first year maintenance agreements and separately priced software maintenance agreements for subsequent years are deferred and recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the maintenance period 
neon also markets and sells its products through independent distributors and resellers 
license and maintenance revenues from these transactions are recognized as above  when sold to the ultimate end user and all of the above conditions are met 
capitalized software costs neon follows sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
research and development expenditures have been charged to operating expenses as incurred 
no such costs have been capitalized to date  as the impact on the financial statements would be insignificant because the time between a product meeting the definition of technological feasibility and readiness for market is very short 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as a part of its normal accounting procedures  neon evaluates outstanding accounts receivable to estimate whether they will be collected 
this is a subjective process that involves making judgments about our customers ability and willingness to pay these accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance that neon believe will be collected 
in estimating the appropriate balance for this allowance  neon considers specific reserves for accounts neon believes may prove to be uncollectible and additional reserves  based on historical collections  for the remainder of our accounts 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are charged to operating expenses  and deductions from the allowance are recorded when specific accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible or when actual experience differs from management s original estimate 
if neon s estimate of uncollectible accounts should prove to be inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
deferred income taxes neon records deferred income tax assets and liabilities on its balance sheet related to events that impact its financial statements and tax returns in different periods 
in order to compute these deferred tax balances  neon first analyzes the differences between the book basis and tax basis of its assets and liabilities referred to as temporary differences 
these temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
if deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities  neon must estimate whether those net deferred asset amounts will be realized in the future 
a valuation allowance is then provided for the net deferred asset amounts that are not likely to be realized 
the change in neon s net deferred income tax balances during a period results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in its statement of operations 
if neon s expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate  the balances of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods 
such adjustments could cause a material effect on neon s results of operations for the period of the adjustment 
accounting for advances to scalable software  inc during fiscal years and  the period in which neon was advancing funds to scalable  neon accounted for its investment in scalable using the modified equity method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  neon recognized of scalable s losses to the extent of advances made in excess of the guaranteed amount 
at march   neon had made total advances of million to scalable including million of unguaranteed advances and recognized cumulative losses of million 
no losses have been recognized in fiscal year since neon has no further obligation to advance funds to scalable 
due to the uncertainties regarding neon s ultimate ability to recover any unguaranteed advances to scalable  neon has determined that it should not record the carrying value of its net advance to scalable above the guaranteed amount of million 
on june   neon entered into a note purchase agreement with jmi services  inc  the largest shareholder of scalable  to sell the million guaranteed note and the million secured note issued by scalable to neon in connection with neon s financing obligations for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
jmi services is an affiliate of john j 
moores  neon s largest shareholder 
the proposed purchase of the scalable notes was reviewed by neon s fully independent board of directors 
the board requested and received a fairness opinion from avail consulting  inc  a houston  texas based independent valuation and financial consultant  stating that the transaction was fair to the stockholders of neon from a financial standpoint 
neon also engaged avail consulting to perform a valuation on both notes receivable from scalable 
the value received by jmi services exceeded the estimated fair value of both notes  as determined by avail consulting
