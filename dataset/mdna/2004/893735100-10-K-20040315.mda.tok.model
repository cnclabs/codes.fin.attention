sales and marketing tkt plans to market and sell the products for which it obtains marketing approval through a combination of establishing its own commercial capabilities and entering into sales  marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties 
tkt europe in april  the company established a subsidiary in sweden known as tkt europe s ab tkt europe for the purpose of marketing  selling and distributing replagal in europe 
the company owns an equity interest in tkt europe and a team of european pharmaceutical executives with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products in europe own the remaining equity interest in tkt europe 
the company and tkt europe are parties to a distribution agreement relating to replagal  and the company and the european stockholders of tkt europe are parties to a stockholders agreement relating to the operation of tkt europe 
under the distribution agreement  tkt granted tkt europe exclusive marketing rights to distribute and market replagal in all countries in europe  and tkt europe agreed to purchase replagal exclusively from tkt at a negotiated transfer price 
tkt is also required to pay tkt europe a marketing service fee 
the distribution agreement continues until december   and is subject to automatic two year extensions unless a party provides notice of non renewal at least one year prior to the expiration of the term 
the stockholders agreement provides for the governance of tkt europe 
under the agreement  the european stockholders have the right to elect three members of the board of directors  and the company has the right to elect two members of the board of directors 
although the consent of tkt is required for various significant matters relating to the operation of tkt europe  most day to day operations of tkt europe are directed by the european stockholders 
under the stockholders agreement for tkt europe  the company is entitled to purchase the european stockholders ownership interest in tkt europe in september  for a price determined in accordance with a formula 
should the company not exercise that right  the european stockholders of tkt europe can require the company to purchase the european stockholders ownership interest sixty days thereafter 
the buyout price is equal to a of the operating profits  as defined in the stockholders agreement  for the period from september  to august   multiplied by a buyout factor of four  subject to adjustment  plus b of the accumulated positive earnings of tkt europe 
as a result  the amount of the buyout price is dependent on the profits of tkt europe and the commercial success of replagal in europe 
the company estimates that the buyout price could be between million and million based on the company s current estimates for sales and expenses 
as of march   tkt europe employed full time employees 
asia pacific under the company s agreement with sumitomo  sumitomo is responsible for commercializing replagal in japan  korea  china and taiwan 
under the company s agreement with genzyme  genzyme is responsible for developing and commercializing tkt s is product in japan and other asia pacific territories 
canada in canada  the company established tkt canada inc in for the marketing and sales of replagal and any future products 

table of contents aventis aventis is responsible for obtaining regulatory approval and marketing and selling dynepo throughout the world except for japan 
aventis has not launched dynepo in europe 
the company cannot predict whether or when aventis will determine to launch dynepo in europe or anywhere else in the world 
united states commercialization in the united states  the company has developed a small commercial infrastructure for the marketing and sale of its products 
the company expects that it will expand its infrastructure in the united states at such time as it anticipates receiving approval to market its products in the united states 
distributors tkt uses third party distributors to distribute replagal in many areas of the world including australia  canada  europe  israel  and taiwan 
customers the company had three significant customers  healthcare at home limited  globopharm ag  and the university of mainz  who accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s product sales in the same customers accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s product sales in manufacturing tkt manufactures its therapeutic protein products using its proprietary gene activation technology as well as conventional recombinant protein production technology 
tkt currently uses  and expects to continue to use in the future  internal manufacturing and contract manufacturing by third parties to meet its production requirements for preclinical testing  clinical trials  and commercial supply of its products and product candidates 
prior to july  the company relied on a contract manufacturing arrangement with a third party for the production of bulk drug substance for replagal for commercial sale 
in january  tkt terminated its arrangements with the contract manufacturer effective in july in connection with the termination of this arrangement  the company incurred a termination fee of million in the company incurred charges of million related to excess capacity at the terminated manufacturer s facility during the first half of the company has also manufactured bulk drug substance for replagal for commercial sale and clinical trials and bulk drug substance for is and ga gcb for clinical trials at its cambridge  massachusetts manufacturing facility the alewife facility 
in july  the european commission approved the alewife facility for the commercial manufacture of bulk drug substance for replagal 
in october  the company began significant renovations to the alewife facility in order to expand its capacity and configure the facility for the production at a commercial scale of products other than replagal 
in anticipation of these renovations  in the third quarter of the company ceased all manufacturing operations at the alewife facility 
the company expects to complete these renovations in the first half of and to recommence manufacturing operations in the second half of once the company completes these renovations  the appropriate regulatory authorities  including the european commission  will need to re inspect and re approve the facility 
following such re approval  the company plans to resume manufacture of bulk drug substance for replagal for commercial sale and clinical trials and of bulk drug substance for is and ga gcb for clinical trials at the alewife facility 
at the present time  the company anticipates that existing inventory will be sufficient to fill customer orders for replagal into if and when is and ga gcb are approved for commercialization  the company expects to manufacture bulk drug substance for is and ga gcb for commercial sale at the alewife facility 
the company spent approximately million for improvements to the alewife facility through and expects to spend an additional to million related to these renovations during the first half of 
table of contents the company is developing new manufacturing processes to manufacture tkt s bulk drug substance for replagal and for is 
following the development of these new processes  the appropriate regulatory authorities  including the european commission  will need to approve the new processes 
the company relies on contract manufacturing arrangements with third parties with respect to the other aspects of the manufacture of replagal  is  and ga gcb  including the preparation and packaging of tkt manufactured bulk drug substance into finished product 
the company also relies on third parties for supplies and raw materials used in the manufacture of its products 
under tkt s collaborative arrangement with aventis  aventis is required to manufacture dynepo for clinical trials and for commercial sales 
patents  proprietary rights  trade secrets  and licenses patents and proprietary issues the company believes that protection of the proprietary nature of its products and technology is important to its business 
accordingly  it has adopted and plans to maintain a vigorous program to secure and maintain such protection 
the company s practice is to file patent applications with respect to technology  inventions  and improvements that are important to its business 
the company also relies upon trade secrets  unpatented know how  continuing technological innovation  and the pursuit of licensing opportunities to develop and maintain its competitive position 
as of december   tkt owned approximately issued united states patents  approximately pending united states patent applications  approximately corresponding issued foreign patents from third parties  and approximately corresponding pending foreign patent applications 
as of december   tkt licensed approximately issued united states patents and additional corresponding foreign patents from third parties 
the patents owned or licensed by tkt expire at various dates through and cover various aspects of tkt s protein products and gene therapy products as well as various methods related to the development and manufacture of such products 
intellectual property relating to competing products for many currently marketed proteins  the product manufactured using conventional genetic engineering techniques does not represent the first time the protein was isolated and purified 
as such  it is generally not possible to obtain a broad composition of matter patent for many of the currently marketed proteins 
in contrast  the isolated and purified dna sequences encoding these proteins  various vectors used to insert such dna sequences into production cell lines  cell lines modified by the insertion of such dna sequences  and corresponding methods  including methods of producing proteins using this approach  led to issued patents in many cases 
while every patent must be analyzed on a claim by claim basis  tkt believes that  in many instances  its technology does not infringe claims based on isolated and purified dna sequences encoding proteins of commercial interest because gene activation technology does not rely on the manipulation of cloned genes 
the company also avoids the use of technologies such as specific protein purification procedures that are the subject of patents that are not limited to protein products manufactured using conventional genetic engineering techniques 
the company  however  is currently involved in litigation with mount sinai in the united states relating to replagal and  along with the company s collaborative partner  aventis  is involved in litigation in the united states and the united kingdom with amgen and kirin amgen relating to dynepo 
a description of this litigation is set forth in item legal proceedings 
trade secrets to further protect its trade secrets and other proprietary property  the company requires all employees  consultants  and collaborators having access to such proprietary property to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements before beginning their relationship with the company 
while such arrangements are intended to enable the company to better control the use and disclosure of its proprietary property and provide for the company s ownership of proprietary technology developed on its behalf  they may not provide 
table of contents meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  or in the event that such trade secrets or other proprietary property are independently developed by a third party 
intellectual property licenses cell genesys  inc in june  the company obtained an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications from cell genesys  inc cell genesys related to cell genesys approach to gene activation 
in consideration for the license  the company initially paid cell genesys million in cash and issued to cell genesys million of shares of the company s common stock 
under the agreement  cell genesys also has the potential to receive certain milestone payments contingent upon the outcome of related patent matters under the license agreement 
if all of the milestones occur  the company will be obligated to pay cell genesys an aggregate of million payable in part in cash and in part in stock 
the company is not required to make royalty payments to cell genesys 
the agreement terminates on the termination date of the last to expire patent right subject to the agreement  but is subject to earlier termination by either party in the event of a breach of the agreement by the other party 
the company believes the last to expire patent expires in under the agreement  the company agreed that the number of shares of common stock initially issued to cell genesys would be adjusted at the time the company registered such shares for resale under the securities act of  if the market value of such shares at that time was greater or less than million  as calculated in accordance with a predetermined formula 
in january  the company and cell genesys renegotiated the consideration paid for the license  and the company repurchased the shares of stock issued to cell genesys for million in cash 
women s and children s hospital  north adelaide  australia the company has an exclusive worldwide license to pending and issued patents from women s and children s hospital  north adelaide  australia related to certain mucopolysaccharidoses diseases  a type of lysosomal storage disorder  including hurler and scheie syndromes or mps i  hunter syndrome or mps ii  and sanfilippo syndrome or mps iii 
tkt uses these pending and issued patents in the development of is 
under this license  tkt is obligated to pay royalties on net sales of products covered by a valid claim of a patent or patent application licensed to tkt 
the license also imposes various commercialization  insurance and other obligations on the company 
the company s failure to comply with these obligations could result in the termination of the license or the conversion of the license from an exclusive license to a non exclusive license 
the license terminates upon the expiration of the last to expire of the patents covered by the license 
competition the biotechnology industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
the company believes that the primary competitive factors relating to the products that it is marketing and developing include safety and efficacy compared to competitive products  distribution channels  price and the availability of reimbursement 
therapeutics for the treatment of rare genetic diseases in general  the company believes that rare genetic diseases have markets that are too small to attract the resources of most larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
as a result  the company believes that the primary competition with respect to its products for rare genetic diseases is from smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
for example  competitors for lysosomal storage disorders include biomarin pharmaceutical inc  actelion ltd  and genzyme 
specifically  replagal competes with genzyme s fabrazyme  and any product commercialized by the company to treat gaucher disease will compete with genzyme s cerezyme 
tkt does not know of any party developing an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of hunter syndrome 

table of contents the markets for some of the potential products for rare genetic diseases caused by protein deficiencies are quite small 
as a result  if competitive products exist  the company may not be able to successfully commercialize its products 
some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
generally  if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity means that applications to market the same drug for the same indication may not be approved  except in limited circumstances  for a period of up to years in europe and for a period of seven years in the united states 
both replagal and fabrazyme were granted co exclusive orphan drug status in the european union for up to years 
genzyme has orphan drug exclusivity for fabrazyme in the united states until april gene activated versions of proteins that would compete with currently marketed proteins tkt is developing gene activated protein products that would compete with proteins currently being marketed by third parties 
for instance  in the case of dynepo  competing products are marketed by amgen  johnson johnson  f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
boehringer mannheim gmbh  sankyo company ltd  chugai pharmaceutical co  ltd  and the pharmaceutical division of kirin brewery co  ltd 
in japan 
many of the protein products against which the company s gene activated proteins would compete have well known brand names  have been promoted extensively  and have achieved market acceptance by third party payors  hospitals  physicians  and patients 
in addition  many of the companies that produce these protein products have patents covering techniques used to produce these products  which have served as effective barriers to entry in the therapeutic proteins market 
as with amgen and its erythropoietin product  these companies may seek to block tkt s entry into the market by asserting that the company s gene activated proteins infringe their patents 
many of these products may be losing most or all of their patent protection in the next few years 
as a result  the markets in which these products compete may become genericized 
consequently  some of these companies are also seeking to develop and commercialize new or potentially improved versions of their proteins 
gene therapy the company s gene therapy system will have to compete with other gene therapy systems  as well as with conventional methods of treating the disease and conditions targeted 
although no gene therapy product is currently marketed  a number of companies  including major biotechnology companies  pharmaceutical companies and development stage companies  are actively involved in this field 
united states government regulation the testing  manufacturing  labeling  advertising  promotion  export  and marketing  among other things  of tkt s products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the united states 
in the united states  the fda regulates pharmaceutical products under the fda statute  and other laws  including  in the case of biologics  the public health service act 
tkt believes that most of its products will be regulated by the fda as biologics 
tkt cannot market a biologic or drug until it has submitted an application for marketing authorization to the fda  and the fda has approved it 
both before and after approval is obtained  violations of regulatory requirements may result in various adverse consequences  including the fda s delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market  operating restrictions  and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
the steps required before a product may be approved for marketing in the united states generally include preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests  the submission to the fda of an ind  for human clinical testing  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin  
table of contents a series of clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product  the submission to the fda of an application for marketing authorization  satisfactory completion of an fda inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with gmp  and fda review and approval of the application for marketing authorization 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of the product  as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product 
the results of the preclinical tests  together with chemistry  manufacturing  and control data  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may be commenced 
the ind will automatically become effective days after its receipt by the fda  unless the fda before that time raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the ind 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed 
tkt cannot be sure that a submitted ind will become effective thereby allowing initiation of a clinical trial for the product in question 
clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap or be combined  and certain phases may not be necessary for a particular product 
phase i trials  the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects  usually involve the testing of the drug for safety  adverse effects  dosage tolerance  and pharmacologic action 
phase ii trials usually involve studies in a limited patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific  targeted conditions  determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
phase iii trials generally further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety within an expanded patient population 
the company or the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of the preclinical and clinical studies  together with other detailed information  including information on the manufacture and composition of the product  are submitted to the fda in the form of an application for marketing authorization 
if the application for marketing authorization contains all pertinent information and data  the fda will formally accept the file for review 
the fda may refuse to file the application for marketing authorization if it does not contain all pertinent information and data 
in that case  the applicant may resubmit the application for marketing authorization when it contains the missing information and data 
before approving an application for marketing authorization  the fda will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured  and will not approve the product unless current gmp compliance is satisfactory 
the fda often requests a review of an application for marketing authorization or parts of an application for marketing authorization by an advisory committee of outside experts 
the fda is free to accept or reject the advisory committee s recommendations 
the fda may refuse to approve an application for marketing authorization if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  require additional testing or information  or require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product 
the testing and approval process require substantial time  effort  and financial resources  and tkt cannot be certain that any of its products will be approved on a timely basis  if at all 
also  new federal  state  or local government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of its products under development 
the fda sometimes approves biologics and drugs under its accelerated approval regulations 
these approvals may be issued when  among other circumstances  clinical studies establish that the biological product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 
when approval is granted under the accelerated approval regulations  the holder of the regulatory approval must conduct additional studies after approval to demonstrate the clinical benefit of the product 
failure to conduct 
table of contents the required studies  or to comply with other accelerated approval requirements  may result in the fda s withdrawing or modifying the approval 
once the fda approves a product  tkt and any third party manufacturers are required to comply with a number of post approval requirements 
for example  tkt will be required to report certain adverse events to the fda  and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling of the products 
also  quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to gmp regulations after approval  and the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with gmp 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  monies  and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain gmp compliance 
in addition  discovery of problems may result in restrictions on a product  manufacturer  or holder of marketing approval  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  tkt is also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and other present and potential future federal  state  or local regulations 
tkt s research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  biological materials  and various radioactive compounds 
although tkt believes that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  tkt could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed tkt s resources 
the fda may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process 
if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity  which means the fda may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity 
also  competitors may receive approval of other different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity 
european union government regulation in the european union  tkt s products are subject to extensive regulation by the european union and the individual member states of the european union 
preclinical testing must be carried out in accordance with principles of good laboratory practice and is subject to inspections by national authorities 
certification of compliance is required in applications for approval to conduct clinical trials and in marketing authorization applications 
clinical trials are subject to national regulation 
at present  the rules are not harmonized  but most member states require some form of notification or approval by government authorities  review and approval by independent ethics committees and other measures to protect the interests of human subjects 
clinical trials are also expected to be carried out in compliance with detailed requirements for good clinical practice 
a european union directive scheduled to take effect in may will harmonize requirements for regulation of clinical trials but will likely also impose a greater bureaucratic burden on sponsors 
additional requirements include a data base of trials across the eu  special provisions for notification or approval of trials relating to biotechnology products and inspections by government authorities to insure compliance with good clinical practice 
all trials  including those in healthy volunteers  will be regulated in this way 
medicinal products to be used in clinical trials will be required to be manufactured to the same standard as those applicable to commercial products 
at the present time the company does not believe the european union s new directives will materially affect clinical operations 
medicinal products intended for commercial distribution in the european union must be subject to a marketing authorization 
for new biotechnology products  marketing authorization applications must be submitted to the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products the emea 
they are 
table of contents reviewed by scientific experts in the committee for proprietary medicinal products the cpmp  which issues an opinion that is referred to the commission of the european communities for a final decision  taken in conjunction with representatives of the member states 
marketing authorization applications must be supported by technical dossiers containing detailed information including reports of preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing information demonstrating that the medicinal product will be safe  effective and of satisfactory quality 
in exceptional circumstances for rare diseases  less than complete clinical data may be accepted such as when the authorities determine that it would be impractical or unethical to carry out full scale pivotal clinical trials 
specific obligations are imposed on the granting of such approvals 
these obligations form part of the formal marketing authorization issued by the european commission and must be reviewed at the intervals specified  minimally on an annual basis 
the annual review includes a reassessment of the overall benefit risk ratio 
if specific obligations are not fulfilled the marketing authorization can be varied  suspended or withdrawn by the agency 
upon completion of all requirements  these conditions are removed 
the european union marketing authorization review process is time consuming  often lasting one to two years or longer 
the review process is suspended whenever the applicant is requested to provide additional information  the applicant may be required to withdraw the application and resubmit it at a later date if additional tests are necessary to provide requested information 
european union and national procedures ordinarily make provision for hearings and appeals  but in practice determinations by the authorities on scientific and medical questions relating to the authorization of medicinal products are often conclusive 
all patient information  including the summary of product characteristics  package leaflet and label and carton texts must be translated into all the languages of the european union before approval 
since may  an additional countries have joined the european union  bringing the number of languages up to establishments located within the european union in which medicinal products are manufactured must be authorized by national authorities and inspected for compliance with good manufacturing practices gmp 
european union authorities also currently inspect establishments in the united states or other non european union countries that manufacture medicinal products for european union markets 
each batch of a medicinal product that is imported to the european union must be tested for compliance with applicable specifications and certified by a qualified person in the european union 
although the united states and the european union have agreed in principle to mutual recognition of gmp inspections  the details have not been worked out in practice  and it is uncertain when  or whether  actual mutual recognition will be achieved 
advertising and promotion of medicinal products are regulated by national authorities pursuant to broadly harmonized provisions in european union directives 
interpretation and enforcement vary from country to country  but many european union member states impose strict requirements concerning inducements and honoraria paid to physicians and other promotional activities 
prescription medicinal products may not be advertised to patients or the general public in the european union 
some member states restrict or prohibit co promotion of the same medicinal product by different pharmaceutical companies 
marketing authorization holders are required to maintain pharmacovigilance systems for collecting and reporting information concerning suspected adverse reactions 
in response to pharmacovigilance reports  authorities may initiate proceedings to revise the prescribing information for medicinal products or to suspend or revoke marketing authorizations 
procedural safeguards are often limited  and marketing authorizations can be suspended with little or no advance notice 
most european union member states maintain public health systems in which many medicinal products are paid for at least in part by government authorities  insurers or other third parties 
nearly every member state has introduced one or more systems to control the cost of medicines supplied under these programs 
member states fix the prices of medicinal products  impose reimbursement limits  establish positive or negative formularies  encourage prescribing or dispensing of generic substitutes for innovative products  and regulate the profitability of the pharmaceutical industry 
wholesalers often purchase medicinal products in low price member states and sell them in higher price member states  so that there is general downward pressure on prices throughout the european union 

table of contents european union medicines laws establish certain protections in addition to patents that are intended to encourage investment in research and development of medicinal products 
european union law includes special provisions for orphan medicines that are intended to treat rare diseases or conditions 
criteria for designation are similar but somewhat different from those in the united states 
orphan medicines are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity except under certain limited circumstances comparable to us law 
during this period of market exclusivity  no similar product  whether or not supported by full safety and efficacy data  will be approved 
this period may also be reduced to six years if the conditions that originally justified orphan designation change or the sponsor makes excessive profits 
provisions for data and market exclusivity only protect against the grant of marketing authorizations 
many european union member states maintain alternative procedures that permit commercial distribution of medicinal products without marketing authorizations on a compassionate or named patient basis 
procedures differ from country to country  but all member states forbid advertising of such products and some countries prohibit or discourage named patient distribution after a suitable licensed product is on the market 
additional foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the united states and europe  tkt will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and sales of tkt s products  including replagal and is 
whether or not united states or european approval has been obtained  approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of clinical trials and marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for united states or european approval 
for marketing outside the united states and europe  the company also is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for products 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing  and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country

replagal patent litigation in july  genzyme and mount sinai filed a patent infringement action against the company in the united states district court of delaware 
the complaint alleges that the company s activities relating to replagal infringe a patent licensed by genzyme from mount sinai 
in january  the united states district court of delaware dismissed this patent litigation granting the company s motion for summary judgment of non infringement and denying genzyme and mount sinai s motion for summary judgment of infringement 
genzyme and mount sinai sought monetary damages and injunctive relief 
in march  genzyme and mount sinai appealed the united states district court of delaware s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit  and in january the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal 
in october  pursuant to a global legal settlement  genzyme agreed to withdraw from this suit and paid the company  mount sinai is not a party to the settlement 
in october  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed a finding of non infringement by the company 
in january  the federal circuit denied mount sinai s petition for a rehearing en banc 
the company believes it is possible  but unlikely  that mount sinai will obtain further appellate review of this decision by the united states supreme court 
dynepo patent litigation in april  amgen commenced a patent infringement action against the company and aventis in the united states district court of massachusetts 
in january  the united states district court of massachusetts concluded that dynepo infringed eight of the claims of five patents that amgen had asserted 
amgen did not seek and was not awarded monetary damages 

table of contents in january  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision affirming in part and reversing in part the decision of the united states district court of massachusetts and remanded the action to the united states district court of massachusetts for further proceedings 
in particular  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit upheld the united states district court of massachusetts determination of invalidity of one of amgen s patents  upheld the united states district court of massachusetts determination that some claims of two other amgen patents were infringed  but vacated the united states district court of massachusetts determination that those patents were not invalid  and vacated the united states district court of massachusetts determination that dynepo infringed some claims of the two remaining amgen patents  and vacated the united states district court of massachusetts determination that one of these patents was not invalid 
as part of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit s ruling  it remanded the case to the united states district court of massachusetts and instructed it to reconsider the validity of amgen s patents in light of potentially invalidating prior art 
the united states district court of massachusetts has recently concluded the remand proceedings and heard oral argument on some of these issues in july the company expects that the united states district court of massachusetts will enter a decision on the remanded issues at some point during the first half of the united states district court of massachusetts also recently issued a decision upholding its earlier findings that amgen successfully rebutted the presumption of prosecution history estoppel with respect to certain patents  and therefore  the company and aventis infringe such patents in light of recent supreme court precedents 
on remand  the company and aventis presented affirmative defenses with respect to such patents 
both amgen and aventis  together with the company  will have the right to appeal the decision of the united states district court of massachusetts to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
in addition  in july  the company commenced legal proceedings with aventis in the united kingdom against kirin amgen  which sought a declaration that a european patent held by kirin amgen will not be infringed by the company s activities relating to dynepo and that certain claims of kirin amgen s uk patent are invalid 
in april  the high court of justice in the united kingdom ruled that dynepo infringed one of four claims of the patent asserted by kirin amgen 
in july  the court of appeals in the united kingdom reversed the high court of justice and ruled that dynepo did not infringe kirin amgen s patent 
kirin amgen petitioned the house of lords to hear an appeal from the decision of the court of appeals

tkt has received approval to market and sell replagal agalsidase alfa  an enzyme replacement therapy for the long term treatment of patients with fabry disease  in countries outside of the united states 
two of the products tkt is developing include is  an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of hunter syndrome  and ga gcb for the treatment of gaucher disease 
the company is currently conducting a pivotal clinical trial of is and anticipates starting a phase i ii clinical trial of ga gcb in the second quarter of tkt is currently evaluating out licensing opportunities for ga gcb as well as a number of other gene activated and gene therapy products 
with the exception of  the company has incurred substantial annual operating losses since inception 
the company expects to incur significant operating losses until substantial product sales are generated 
until such time  the company is dependent upon product sales  collections of accounts receivable  existing cash resources  interest income  external financing from equity offerings  debt financings  and collaborative research and development alliances to finance its operations 
at december   the company s accumulated deficit was  the company expects that its existing capital resources  together with anticipated proceeds from collections on existing and future accounts receivable on product sales  anticipated cash payments under collaborative agreements  and interest income  will be sufficient to fund its operations into 
table of contents the company s results of operations may vary significantly from period to period depending on  among other factors the timing and amount of replagal product sales  as well as the collection of receivables  continued progress in its research and development programs  particularly is  the scope and results of its clinical trials  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of expansion of tkt s internal manufacturing facilities  the inherent variability of biological manufacturing activities  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for sales denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  the quality and timeliness of the performance of third party suppliers  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the outcome of pending purported class action and other related  or potentially related  actions and the litigation costs with respect to such actions  the timing and cost of the company s purchase of the minority interest in tkt europe  the outcome of the sec investigation  and tkt s ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires tkt to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
tkt bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  tkt evaluates these estimates and judgments 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company regards an accounting estimate underlying its financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to level of subjectivity and judgment involved or the susceptibility of such matter to change and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
while tkt s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to tkt s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  tkt regards the following accounting policies as critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition product sales 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the company determines that collection is reasonably assured in europe and in some other countries outside of the united states  once reimbursement agreements and pricing arrangements are established and formalized  
table of contents as these agreements establish the relevant governmental agency s intent to pay  or once there are legally binding purchase agreements between a hospital and the company  or once approval has been granted for the reimbursement of cost for individual patients 
the company only records revenues in those countries for which one of the conditions set forth in the previous sentence has been met 
if any of the above circumstances were to change  it could affect the company s revenue recognition in future periods 
in the european pharmaceutical industry  it is common practice that customers  principally hospitals  have a general right of return on purchases of product 
to date  the company has not had any sales returns 
the company generally ships small quantities of replagal to customers on the basis of firm purchase orders 
the customers generally order replagal for specific patients  and the drug is typically utilized within one month of receipt 
in part due to the expensive price of the drug  customers maintain small inventories of it  typically less than a one month supply 
because of these circumstances  the company expects that it will have no or minimal returns in the future and  accordingly  has not recorded a reserve for sales returns and allowances in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
if any product is returned  the company may need to begin to record reserves for sales returns and allowances and incur charges to revenues in future periods 
license and research revenues 
the company records contract revenue for research and development as it is earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there are no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
the company recognizes revenue from non refundable up front license fees and milestone payments where there is continual involvement through development collaboration or an obligation to supply product  as the obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development period or the period of the manufacturing obligation  as appropriate 
the company recognizes revenue associated with substantive performance milestones based upon the achievement of the milestones  as defined in the respective agreements 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue 
the company has estimated the term of the genzyme distribution agreement to be years  which represents the period under which the company will supply bulk drug substance to genzyme 
if this estimate changes  the company may need to adjust revenue recognition in future periods 
accounts receivable in certain european countries  such as italy and belgium  customary payment terms on accounts receivable are significantly longer than in the united states  particularly for products treating orphan drug indications 
in these countries  the company historically has received and expects to continue to receive  payments approximately one year from the invoice date 
accounts receivable balances for italy and belgium were and of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
the company monitors its days sales outstanding and collections in these countries 
to date  customers in these countries have been paying within the customary payment terms 
if collections and days sales outstanding in these countries deteriorate in the future  the company may need to discount those receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical 
replagal inventory balances as of december  consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
in general  the company s manufacturing process for replagal consists of two distinct phases the manufacture of bulk drug substance and the preparation and packaging of bulk drug substance into finished product 
bulk drug substance has a shelf life of up to months before the product is prepared and packaged into finished goods vials  and an additional two years upon packaging of finished goods in vials 
the company s estimates relating to the current demand for replagal and future sales projections indicate that all of the inventory will be utilized within the designated shelf lives of both bulk drug substance and finished 
table of contents goods vials 
if actual product sales differ from the company s projections  inventory may not be fully utilized 
as a result  the company would need to write down the value of such inventory to its net realizable value 
this write down would be recorded as additional cost of goods sold 
asset impairment the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment indicators at each reporting period in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that an impairment indicator existed with respect to a manufacturing facility 
an undiscounted cash flow analysis confirmed the impairment  and the company obtained an appraisal of the manufacturing facility to determine its fair market value 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of  at december   based upon the difference between the fair market value of the facility and its carrying value at such date 
the company is actively seeking a buyer for this facility 
upon a sale of the facility  any difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the facility will be recognized as an impairment charge  or credit  in the period of the sale 
restructuring charges in february  tkt announced a major reorganization in an effort to reduce costs and narrow the scope of the company s research initiatives 
the reorganization included reduction in workforce  consolidation of facilities and disposal of certain assets 
these restructuring charges were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and included a net facilities charge 
in determining the net facilities charge  various assumptions were made  with respect to sublease terms and expected sublease rates 
these estimates were made based on a periodic review of current sublease environment and acquired market quotes 
should operating lease rental rates decline or should it take longer than expected to find suitable tenants to sublease the facilities  adjustments to the net present value of remaining lease obligations may be necessary in future periods based upon the future events and circumstances 
see results of operations below and note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s restructuring actions 
results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes thereto

change change change change in thousands  except percentages product sales license and research revenues product sales since  substantially all replagal product sales have been in europe 
prior to product approval in august  product sales were made in europe under compassionate use programs 
compassionate use programs in certain countries in europe allow limited sales of products that have not yet been approved by the appropriate regulatory agency 
the increase in product sales in reflects an overall increase in unit sales over the increase in replagal product sales in was a result of the launch of replagal  the availability of replagal for sale in additional countries for the entire year  the receipt of pricing and reimbursement in additional countries  and additional patients commencing therapy 

table of contents the company prices replagal in the functional currency of the country into which it is sold 
while overall price levels in local currencies have generally remained consistent since  foreign exchange fluctuations caused an increase in the united states dollar denominated average selling prices 
substantially all of the company s manufacturing costs are in united states dollars 
therefore  any fluctuation in the value of the payment currencies relative to the united states dollar is likely to impact gross margins since the company s manufacturing costs would remain approximately the same while its revenue in terms of united states dollars would change 
foreign currency fluctuations increased sales and gross margins by approximately  or  in and  or  in in  these currency fluctuations were immaterial to gross margin 
the company s gross margin will continue to be affected by currency fluctuations in the future 
product sales and gross margins will be negatively affected if the us dollar strengthens against currencies in which the company sells replagal 
the company currently does not engage in foreign currency hedging activities 
the company expects continued growth in european sales in and a significant percentage growth of sales from the rest of the world  excluding the united states  as additional countries approve replagal and reimbursement is established 
license and research revenues the company earned substantially all of its license and research revenues in   and under its collaborative agreements with genzyme  sumitomo and wyeth 
the decrease in license and research revenues in primarily reflects a decrease in revenues from wyeth due to the termination of research and development fees from wyeth in  which was offset by a  fee that wyeth paid to tkt in connection with the termination of the collaboration agreement in august the decrease in license and research revenue in from was due to the timing of completion of obligations under each collaborative agreement

the increase of  or  in was due primarily to increased product sales volume 
for the year ended december   the decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales reflected continuing improvements in manufacturing and production efficiencies and the sale of replagal inventory that had been produced at the company s alewife facility 
in july  the alewife facility was approved by the european commission to manufacture bulk drug substance for replagal 
the costs to manufacture replagal at the alewife facility prior to approval were expensed as research and development costs 
these factors reduced cost of goods sold by  in the company incurred additional charges amounting to  or of product sales  in related to excess capacity at the terminated contract manufacturer of bulk drug substance of replagal 

table of contents the increase of cost of goods sold in as compared to was primarily due to full year replagal sales in the increase also reflects that the company sold units of replagal containing expensed bulk drug substance in and in the first half of as a result of the sale of these units  cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales did not begin to reflect all production costs until the second half of in  the company also incurred a charge of  or of product sales  related to the termination of the contract manufacturer of bulk drug substance of replagal 
the company has historically relied on contract manufacturing arrangements with third parties for the production of replagal bulk drug substance for commercial sale  as well as contract packaging and labeling services 
in january  the company terminated its agreement with a third party manufacturer of the bulk drug substance of replagal  effective in july in october  the company began significant renovations to the alewife facility in order to expand its capacity and configure the facility for the production on a commercial scale of products other than replagal 
in anticipation of these renovations  in the third quarter of  the company ceased all manufacturing operations at the alewife facility 
production at the alewife facility is scheduled to recommence in the second half of at the present time  the company anticipates that existing inventory will be sufficient to fill customer orders for replagal into the company will continue to rely on third party manufacturers for preparation and packaging services 
the company expects that replagal inventory produced both at the contract manufacturer and at the alewife facility will be sold in cost of goods sold will reflect a mix of full production costs with respect to inventory produced at the contract manufacturer  and partial production costs with respect to inventory manufactured at the alewife facility as the majority of such costs were previously expensed 
the company expects the cost of goods sold percentage for will be approximately of product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled  in  as compared to  in and  in the decrease in of  or  was primarily due to decreases in research and development staffing and in outside testing and supplies costs in connection with the company s restructuring plan 
this decrease also reflected  in non recurring expenditures related to set up and technology transfer fees paid to the contract manufacturer of replagal bulk drug substance in in addition  in  the overall decrease in research and development costs was partially offset by increases in both clinical trial costs associated with the commencement of the is pivotal clinical trial of  and research and development occupancy costs of  primarily related to the company s occupancy of its new corporate headquarters for a full year in the increase in of  or  was primarily due to increases in research and development staffing and manufacturing development costs 
in addition  in november  the company occupied a new combined headquarters and research and development facility for two months  which increased its research and development occupancy costs in the increase in was partially due to the company s incurrence of expenditures totaling  related to set up and technology transfer fees paid to a contract manufacturer of replagal bulk drug substance 
the company does not intend to engage in any further product development activities related to its gene activated protein products  which are versions of proteins that would compete with proteins currently being marketed by third parties  except with respect to ga gcb 
the company is seeking collaborative partners for all of these gene activated protein products other than dynepo 
the company also does not intend to engage in further product development activities related to its gene therapy programs unless those activities are funded under a collaboration agreement with a third party 
the company expects its research and development expenses in to increase compared to primarily because of expenses that it expects to incur for the company s pivotal clinical trial for is and the phase i ii clinical trial for ga gcb  including costs to manufacture clinical supplies 
the company s two largest research and development programs  replagal and is  represent the majority of the company s total research and development spending 
the expenses associated with these 
table of contents programs totaled approximately in as compared to in and in of total research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the replagal program totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of  or  in was primarily the result of the conclusion of certain replagal clinical trials prior to the beginning of the periods as well as decreased expenses incurred in connection with producing clinical materials and set up and technology transfer fees totaling  paid to the contract manufacturer of replagal bulk drug substance 
the increase of  or  in was due primarily to an increase in expenditures related to the continued development of internal manufacturing capability 
tkt has ceased efforts to seek the approval of replagal from the fda 
as a result of this decision  the company expects the amount of future replagal related research and development expenses will decrease significantly 
the company will continue to incur expenses related to the conditions associated with the company s european approval of replagal  including an obligation to conduct additional clinical trials and an obligation to submit an annual assessment of replagal for review by regulatory authorities 
future replagal related expenditures are principally dependent upon those regulatory requirements 
research and development expenses for the is program equaled  in as compared to   in  and  in the increases of  or  and  or  for and  respectively  reflect increases in allocated employee costs associated with is research and development activities and expenses incurred in connection with the company s ongoing clinical trials of is in and  including the phase i ii study in  ongoing maintenance studies in and and the double blind  placebo controlled pivotal clinical trial of is which commenced in the fourth quarter of in addition  expenditures for the manufacture of is for use in these studies and clinical trials contributed to the increase in expenses period over period 
future research and development costs for the is program are not reasonably certain because such costs are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of any additional clinical trials  uncertainties in the timing of the regulatory process  and the costs associated with large scale manufacture of is 
the company estimates that the cost of its pivotal clinical trial of is may aggregate approximately  to  in the company expects that expenses related to is will be significant in as the company intends to prepare applications for marketing approval of is 
intellectual property license expense in june  the company obtained an exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications from cell genesys  inc cell genesys related to cell genesys approach to gene activation 
in consideration for the license  the company initially paid cell genesys  in cash and issued to cell genesys shares of the company s common stock worth  as of the date of the agreement 
under the license agreement  the company agreed that the number of shares of common stock initially issued to cell genesys would be adjusted at the time the company registered such shares for resale under the securities act of  as amended  if the market value of such shares at that time was greater or less than  pursuant to the agreed upon formula  at december   with the closing price of the company s common stock at per share  the company would have been required to issue to cell genesys an additional  shares of common stock 
as a result  the company recorded an additional non cash license fee expense of  in the fourth quarter of on january   the company and cell genesys renegotiated the consideration paid for the license  and the company repurchased the shares of stock issued to cell genesys for  in cash 
the company incurred an additional license expense in the first quarter of of  which represents the further decline in the market value of the company s common stock from december  to january  the repurchased shares have been recorded as treasury stock 
under the license agreement  cell genesys also has the potential to receive certain milestone payments from the company contingent upon the outcome of related patent matters under the license agreement 
if all 
table of contents of the milestones are achieved  the company will be obligated to pay cell genesys an aggregate of  payable in part in cash and in part in stock

the increase in weighted average shares outstanding reflects the sale of  common shares from the company s public offerings of common stock in june and december and the issuance of  shares of common stock upon the conversion of all of the then outstanding series a convertible preferred stock in november 
table of contents liquidity and sources of capital since its inception  tkt has financed its operations through the sale of common and preferred stock  borrowings under debt agreements  revenues from collaborative agreements  interest income and  more recently  with collections from accounts receivable 
in the near term  tkt expects to finance its operations principally from existing cash and cash equivalents and from collections of accounts receivable related to sales of replagal 
the company expects that its existing capital resources  together with anticipated collections on existing and future accounts receivable on product sales  anticipated cash payments under collaborative agreements  and interest income  will be sufficient to fund its operations into cash flows the company had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  at december   including restricted marketable securities collateralizing letters of credit totaling  at december   the company s owned subsidiary  tkt europe  held  of the  primarily denominated in swedish krona  british pound  and euro 
cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested in united states government and agency obligations and money market funds 
the company used net cash of  for operating activities for the year ended december  major cash flow changes consisted of a net loss of  an increase in accounts receivable of  an increase in accrued restructuring of  a decrease in accrued expenses of  and a decrease of inventory of  net cash usage decreased in from primarily due to cost savings associated with the company s restructuring efforts  growth in replagal sales  increased accounts receivable collections  and a decrease in inventories 
working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  significant changes in working capital during included a  decrease in accrued expenses  primarily related to intellectual property license expense related to cell genesys 
accounts receivable increased by  in due to growth of replagal sales in europe 
inventory decreased by  in due to increases in replagal sales and a reduction in manufacturing activity at the terminated contract manufacturer and the company s alewife facility 
in certain european countries  such as italy and belgium  customary payment terms on accounts receivable are significantly longer than in the united states  particularly for products treating orphan drug indications 
in these countries  the company historically has received  and expects to continue to receive  payments approximately one year from the invoice date 
accounts receivable balances for italy and belgium were and of total accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
the company monitors its days sales outstanding and collections in these countries 
to date  these customers have been paying within the customary payment terms 
if collections and days sales outstanding in these countries deteriorate in the future  the company s liquidity will be adversely affected 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  net maturities and sales of marketable securities contributed  to net cash provided by investing activities 
the company used net cash of  during for property and equipment purchases related to leasehold improvements and equipment for the company s manufacturing facility 
the company expects to spend a total of approximately  for purchases of property and equipment in  principally for expanding its internal manufacturing capabilities 

table of contents the  effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the weakening united states dollar relative to the swedish krona  euro  british pounds and the translation of our foreign subsidiaries cash and accounts receivable balances  which are primarily denominated in the euro currency 
the company s cash requirements for operating activities and investment activities have significantly exceeded its internally generated funds 
the company expects that its cash requirements for such activities will continue to exceed its internally generated funds until it is able to generate substantially greater product sales 
the company expects that it will require substantial additional funds to support its research and development programs  obligations under license agreements  acquisition of technologies  preclinical and clinical testing of its products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  expansion of internal manufacturing capabilities  selling  general and administrative expenses  and the buyout of the minority interests in tkt europe 
the company plans to meet its long term cash requirements through proceeds from product sales and revenues from collaborative agreements 
in december the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec  which became effective in december this shelf registration statement permits the company to offer  from time to time  any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants of up to an aggregate of  the company currently has approximately  available under this shelf registration statement 
the company may also pursue opportunities to obtain additional external financing in the future through debt financing  lease arrangements related to facilities and capital equipment  and collaborative research and development agreements 
if the company is unable to obtain additional financing  the company may be required to reduce the scope of its planned research  development  sales and marketing efforts  which could harm the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon equity and debt market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on the company s continued progress in its preclinical and clinical development programs  and the extent of its commercial success 
there can be no assurance that external funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s estimated significant contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less than after year years years years total non cancelable operating leases estimate of tkt europe buyout price estimate of clinical trial commitments purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations in april  the company established tkt europe for the purpose of marketing  selling and distributing replagal in europe 
under the stockholders agreement for tkt europe  the company is entitled to purchase the european stockholders ownership interest in tkt europe in september  for a price determined in accordance with a formula 
should the company not exercise that right  the european stockholders of tkt europe can require the company to purchase the european stockholders ownership interest sixty days thereafter 
the buyout price is equal to a of the operating profits  as defined in the stockholders agreement  for the period from september  to august   multiplied by a buyout factor of four  subject to adjustment  plus b of the accumulated positive earnings of tkt europe 
as a result  the amount of the buyout price is dependent on the profits of tkt europe and the commercial success 
table of contents of replagal in europe 
the company estimates that the buyout price could be between  and  based on the company s current estimates for sales and expenses 
as of december   the company had committed to pay approximately  to various contract vendors for administering and executing clinical trials 
the timing of payments is not reasonably certain as payments are dependent upon actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
however  the company does expect to pay for these commitments throughout and into as ongoing trials are completed 
the company also is subject to the potential commitments discussed in the following paragraph that is not included in the above table in june  the company obtained an exclusive license to certain patent and patent applications from cell genesys related to cell genesys approach to gene activation 
in consideration for the license  the company paid  cash in june and an additional  in january if cell genesys achieves all the milestones related to patent matters under the license agreement  the company will be obligated to pay cell genesys an aggregate of  payable in part in cash and in part in stock 
the company cannot predict when these milestones will become due  if ever 
the company is not required to make royalty payments to cell genesys 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  which expire at various times through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate use of loss carryforwards and tax credits  the company has fully reserved against any potential tax benefit 
the future utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be subject to limitation under the changes in stock ownership rules of the internal revenue code 
because of this limitation  it is possible that taxable income in future years  which would otherwise be offset by net operating losses  will not be offset and  therefore  will be subject to tax 
litigation expenses the company is a party to the legal proceedings listed below which are described in greater detail under item legal proceedings 
the costs related to these proceedings have been significant and the company expects that these costs will continue to be significant 
the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any of these proceedings 
a decision by a court in the united states or in any other jurisdiction in a manner adverse to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has been engaged in patent litigation with genzyme and mount sinai with respect to replagal 
in october  pursuant to a global legal settlement  genzyme agreed to withdraw from this patent litigation and paid the company  mt 
sinai is not a party to the settlement 
as of december   the company had incurred approximately  in litigation expenses associated with the replagal litigation 
the company and aventis have been involved in patent infringement actions with amgen and kirin amgen with respect to dynepo 
the litigation is costly and the company is required to reimburse aventis  which is paying the litigation expenses  for of the expenses 
aventis is entitled to deduct up to of any royalties due to the company from the sale of dynepo until aventis has recouped the full amount of tkt s share of litigation expenses

this interpretation addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities in which they are determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of their variable economic interest 
the interpretation is intended to provide guidance in judging multiple economic interests in an entity and in determining the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation outlines disclosure requirements for variable interest entities in existence prior to january   and outlines consolidation requirements for variable interest entities created after january  the company will adopt the provisions of fin in the first quarter of and the interpretation is not expected to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

table of contents certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors could cause actual results to differ from those indicated by forward looking statements made by the company in this annual report and elsewhere from time to time 
development  clinical and regulatory risks if our clinical trials are not successful  we may not be able to develop and commercialize our products  including is 
in order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our potential products  we and our collaborators will be required to complete extensive clinical trials in humans to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products 
however  we may not be able to commence or complete these clinical trials in any specified time period  or at all  either because the fda or other regulatory agencies object  because we are unable to attract or retain clinical trial participants  or for other reasons 
even if we complete a clinical trial of one of our potential products  the data collected from the clinical trial may not indicate that our product is safe or efficacious to the extent required by the fda  the european commission  or other regulatory agencies to approve the potential product 
for example  we are currently conducting a pivotal clinical trial of is in patients with hunter syndrome at nine sites around the world 
if the results are positive  we expect to file applications for marketing approval in the united states and europe in the second half of however  even if we file such applications  the fda  the european commission and other regulatory agencies with which we file applications may not agree that our product is safe and efficacious and may not approve our product 
the results from preclinical testing of a product that is under development may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials 
in addition  the results of early human clinical trials may not be predictive of results that will be obtained in larger scale  advanced stage clinical trials 
furthermore  we  one of our collaborators  or a regulatory agency with jurisdiction over the trials may suspend clinical trials at any time if the patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks  or for other reasons 
the rate of completion of clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate of enrollment of patients 
patient accrual is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the existence of competitive clinical trials  and the availability of alternative treatments 
delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs and prolonged clinical development 
in addition  patients may withdraw from a clinical trial for a variety of reasons 
if we fail to accrue and maintain the number of patients into one of our clinical trials for which the clinical trial was designed  the statistical power of the clinical trial may be reduced which would make it harder to demonstrate that our products are safe and efficacious 
regulatory authorities  clinical investigators  institutional review boards  data safety monitoring boards and the hospitals at which our clinical trials are conducted all have the power to stop our clinical trials prior to completion 
if our studies are not completed  we would be unable to show the safety an efficacy required to obtain marketing authorization for our product 
we may not be able to obtain marketing approvals for our products 
we are not able to market any of our products in the united states  europe or in any other jurisdiction without marketing approval from the fda  the european commission  or any equivalent foreign regulatory agency 
the regulatory process to obtain marketing approval for a new drug or biologic takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in august  the european commission granted marketing authorization of replagal in the european union  approximately one year after we submitted our marketing authorization application to the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  or emea  and approximately five years after we filed our 
table of contents investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda 
we are continuing to seek marketing approval for replagal in a number of other countries in the world 
if the results from the pivotal trial of our is product are positive  we expect to file applications for marketing approval of our is product in the united states and europe in the second half of although the european commission has granted marketing approval of dynepo  a fully human erythropoietin for the treatment of anemia related to chronic renal failure  in the european union  dynepo has not been approved in the united states 
in  our collaborator on the development of dynepo  aventis  submitted a biologics license application  or bla to the fda seeking marketing authorization for dynepo in the united states 
the fda did not accept the bla for filing  and requested that aventis provide additional manufacturing data 
aventis has not yet submitted the requested additional data to the fda  and we cannot predict whether or when aventis will do so 
in addition  aventis has not launched dynepo in europe 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when any of our applications for marketing authorization relating to any of our products  including replagal  is  and dynepo  or additional applications for marketing authorization that we may make in the future as to these or other products  will be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities 
among other things  we have had only limited experience in preparing applications and obtaining regulatory approvals 
if approval is granted  it may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of the product 
for example  there are conditions associated with our european approval of replagal  including an obligation to conduct additional clinical trials and an obligation to submit an annual assessment of replagal for review by the european commission 
if we do not complete these clinical trials on a timely basis or the results of these trials are not satisfactory to the european commission  the european commission may withdraw or suspend replagal approval 
if approval of an application to market a product is not granted on a timely basis or at all  or we are unable to maintain our approval  our business may be materially harmed 
we have developed several gene activated protein products that would compete with proteins that are currently being marketed by third parties 
the fda and european regulatory authorities may consider our gene activated protein products to be follow on biologics 
the fda and european regulatory authorities are re evaluating their respective approval processes with respect to follow on biologics 
therefore  the process for approval  and timing of approval  for our gene activated products may be heavily influenced by united states and european decisions regarding follow on biologics 
the timing and content of these decisions  if any  is highly unpredictable 
if the process ultimately adopted for approval  or the timing of approval  for follow on biologics is cumbersome or lengthy  we may not be able to realize much  if any  value from our gene activated products  or we may not be able to partner with third parties to continue developing or marketing such products 
we may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases 
some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing authorization 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process  but does make the product eligible for orphan drug exclusivity and certain tax credits in the united states 
generally  if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity means that another application to market the same drug for the same indication may not be approved  except in limited circumstances set forth in the fda statute  for a period of up to ten years in europe and for a period of seven years in the united states 
obtaining orphan drug designations and orphan drug exclusivity for our products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases may be critical to the success of these products 
our competitors may obtain orphan drug exclusivity for products competitive with our products before we do as genzyme did with fabrazyme in the united states 
even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any of our potential 
table of contents products  we may not be able to maintain it 
for example  if a competitive product is shown to be clinically superior to our product  any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product 
in august  the european commission granted marketing authorization of replagal in the european union 
the european commission also granted marketing authorization of genzyme s fabrazyme in the european union in august in connection with these approvals  the european commission granted replagal and fabrazyme co exclusive orphan drug status in the european union for up to years 
in april  genzyme received marketing authorization in the united states for fabrazyme 
because fabrazyme had received orphan drug designation in the united states  upon its marketing approval  fabrazyme received orphan drug exclusivity 
because fabrazyme received marketing approval in the united states before replagal and received orphan drug exclusivity  the fda may not approve replagal and replagal will be excluded from the united states market for seven years  until april  unless we receive approval to market and sell replagal in the united states and we can demonstrate that replagal satisfies the limited criteria for exceptions set forth in the fda statute 
in november  our is product for the treatment of hunter syndrome was designated an orphan drug in the united states and in europe 
if our is product receives the first marketing approval for hunter syndrome  then our is product will be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity and no other application to market the same drug for the same indication may be approved  except in limited circumstances  for a period of up to years in europe and for a period of seven years in the united states 
if we fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements to which our products are subject  we could be subject to adverse consequences and penalties 
the testing  manufacturing  labeling  advertising  promotion  export  and marketing  among other things  of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in europe  the united states  and elsewhere throughout the world 
if one of our products is approved by the european commission  the fda or another regulatory agency  we and any third party manufacturers we use will be required to comply with a number of post approval requirements 
in each case  the product  the facilities at which the product is manufactured  any post approval clinical data and our promotional activities will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the emea  the fda and other regulatory authorities 
for example  replagal was granted approval in exceptional circumstances by the european commission 
in exceptional circumstances for rare diseases  less than complete clinical data may be accepted such as when the authorities determine that it would be impractical or unethical to carry out full scale pivotal clinical trials 
specific obligations are imposed on the granting of such approvals 
these obligations form part of the formal marketing authorization issued by the european commission and must be reviewed at the intervals specified  minimally on an annual basis 
the annual review includes a reassessment of the overall benefit risk ratio 
if specific obligations are not fulfilled the marketing authorization can be varied  suspended or withdrawn by the agency 
upon completion of all requirements  these conditions are removed 
the european commission required us as part of its post approval requirements to conduct additional clinical trials of replagal 
if we do not complete these clinical trials on a timely basis or the results of these studies are not satisfactory to the european commission or we otherwise fail to comply with the conditions imposed on us pursuant to approval in exceptional circumstances  the approval of replagal by the european commission could be withdrawn or suspended 
in addition  in the united states we will be required to report certain adverse events to the fda and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling of the products 
we are required to maintain pharmacovigilance systems for collecting and reporting information concerning suspected adverse reactions to our products 
in response to pharmacovigilance reports  regulatory authorities may initiate proceedings to revise the prescribing information for our products or to suspend or 
table of contents revoke our marketing authorizations 
procedural safeguards are often limited  and marketing authorizations can be suspended with little or no advance notice 
quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practice regulations  or gmp  after approval 
regulatory authorities  including the emea and the fda  periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with gmp 
accordingly  we and our contract manufacturers will need to continue to expend time  monies  and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain gmp compliance 
in addition  discovery of problems may result in financial penalties  suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market  operating restrictions  and the imposition of criminal penalties 
in addition to regulations adopted by the emea  the fda  and other foreign regulatory authorities  we are also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and other federal  state  and local regulations 
our research and development efforts may not result in products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials 
we expend significant resources on research and development and preclinical studies of product candidates 
however  these efforts may not result in the development of products appropriate for testing in human clinical trials 
for example  our research may result in product candidates that are not expected to be efficacious in treating disease or that reveal safety concerns 
we may postpone or terminate research and development of a product candidate or a program at any time for any reason such as the safety or efficacy of the potential product  allocation of resources or unavailability of qualified research and development personnel 
adverse events in the field of gene therapy may impair our ability to obtain collaborative partners for our gene therapy programs 
we have terminated internal development of our gene therapy programs and are seeking collaborative partners with which to continue to develop these programs 
adverse events in the field of gene therapy  although not occurring in our clinical trials  may impair our ability to enter into collaborations for our programs 
in particular  in november  a patient with a rare metabolic disorder died in a gene therapy trial conducted at the university of pennsylvania 
in addition  in october  a french boy developed a leukemia like disease nearly three years after participating in a gene therapy study as a baby 
as a result of these and other events  a number of gene therapy clinical trials have been terminated or suspended in the united states and in other countries  and regulatory authorities have grown increasingly concerned about the safety of gene therapy 
litigation and intellectual property risks we are a party to patent litigation involving replagal which could preclude us from manufacturing or selling replagal 
in july  genzyme and mount sinai school of medicine of new york university filed a patent infringement action against us in the united states district court of delaware 
the complaint alleges that our activities relating to replagal infringe a patent licensed by genzyme from mount sinai 
in january  the united states district court of delaware dismissed this patent litigation granting our motion for summary judgment of non infringement and denying genzyme and mount sinai s motion for summary judgment of infringement 
genzyme and mount sinai sought monetary damages and injunctive relief 
in march  genzyme and mount sinai appealed the united states district court of delaware s ruling to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit  and in january the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit heard oral arguments on the appeal 
in october  pursuant to a global legal settlement  genzyme agreed to withdraw from this suit and paid us approximately million 
mount sinai is not a party to the settlement 
in october  the united states court of appeals for the 
table of contents federal circuit affirmed a finding of non infringement by us 
in january  the federal circuit denied mount sinai s petition for a rehearing en banc 
we believe it is possible  but unlikely  that mount sinai will obtain further appellate review of this decision by the united states supreme court 
we are a party to litigation with amgen  inc and kirin amgen  inc 
involving dynepo which could preclude us from manufacturing or selling dynepo 
in april  amgen commenced a patent infringement action against us and aventis in the united states united states district court of massachusetts 
in january  the united states district court of massachusetts concluded that dynepo infringed eight of the claims of five patents that amgen had asserted 
amgen did not seek and was not awarded monetary damages 
in january  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit issued a decision affirming in part and reversing in part the decision of the united states district court of massachusetts and remanded the action to the united states district court of massachusetts for further proceedings 
in particular  the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit upheld the united states district court of massachusetts determination of invalidity of one of amgen s patents  upheld the united states district court of massachusetts determination that some claims of two other amgen patents were infringed  but vacated the united states district court of massachusetts determination that those patents were not invalid  and vacated the united states district court of massachusetts determination that dynepo infringed some claims of the two remaining amgen patents  and vacated the united states district court of massachusetts determination that one of these patents was not invalid 
as part of the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit s ruling  it remanded the case to the united states district court of massachusetts and instructed it to reconsider the validity of amgen s patents in light of potentially invalidating prior art 
the united states district court of massachusetts has recently concluded the remand proceedings and heard oral argument on some of these issues in july we expect that the united states district court of massachusetts will enter a decision on the remanded issues at some point during the first half of the united states district court of massachusetts also recently issued a decision upholding its earlier findings that amgen successfully rebutted the presumption of prosecution history estoppel with respect to certain patents  and therefore  we and aventis infringe such patents in light of recent supreme court precedents 
on remand  we and aventis presented affirmative defenses with respect to such patents 
both amgen and aventis  together with us  will have the right to appeal the decision of the united states district court of massachusetts to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
in addition  in july  we commenced legal proceedings with aventis in the united kingdom against kirin amgen  which sought a declaration that a european patent held by kirin amgen will not be infringed by our activities relating to dynepo and that certain claims of kirin amgen s uk patent are invalid 
in april  the high court of justice in the united kingdom ruled that dynepo infringed one of four claims of the patent asserted by kirin amgen 
in july  the court of appeals in the united kingdom reversed the high court of justice and ruled that dynepo did not infringe kirin amgen s patent 
kirin amgen petitioned the house of lords to hear an appeal from the decision of the court of appeals 
the house of lords agreed to hear this appeal during the summer of we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of either litigation 
if we and our collaborator  aventis  are not successful in the dynepo litigation  we and aventis would be precluded from making  using and selling dynepo in the united states and or in the united kingdom 
we are required to reimburse aventis  which is paying the litigation expenses  for of the expenses 
aventis is entitled to deduct up to of any royalties due to us from it with respect to the sale of dynepo until aventis has recouped the full amount of our share of litigation expenses 
we currently estimate that our share of the expenses associated with the litigation will total between approximately million and million by the time the matter is finally adjudicated 

table of contents we are a party to shareholder lawsuits and a derivative action regarding the adequacy of our public disclosure which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition

the complaint purports to assert derivative claims against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty  and to assert a claim for contribution and indemnification on behalf of us for any liability we incur as a result of the individual defendants alleged misconduct 
the complaint seeks declaratory  equitable and monetary relief  an unspecified amount of damages  with interest  and attorney s fees and costs 

table of contents in august  the plaintiff filed its verified amended derivative complaint  which we refer to as the amended derivative complaint 
the amended derivative complaint alleges that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties owed to us and our stockholders by causing us to issue materially false and misleading statements to the public  by signing our form ks for the years and and by signing a registration statement 
the amended derivative complaint also alleges that defendant dr 
selden sold our stock while in possession of material non public information 
the plaintiffs seek declaratory  equitable and monetary relief  an unspecified amount of damages  with interest  and attorney s fees and costs 
in september  we served a motion to dismiss the amended derivative complaint 
a hearing of the motion was held in january as of december   we had spent approximately million related to these lawsuits 
we expect that the costs related to these suits will be significant 
we can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any of these suits 
if we are not successful in defending these actions  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
in addition  even if we are successful  the defense of these actions may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running our business 
the sec is investigating us regarding our public disclosures and filings  as well as transactions in our securities  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in may  we received a copy of a formal order of investigation by the sec 
the order of investigation relates to our disclosures and public filings with regard to replagal and the status of the fda s approval process for replagal  as well as transactions in our securities 
we are cooperating fully and will continue to cooperate fully with the sec in the investigation 
as of december   we had spent approximately million related to this matter 
if this investigation results in a determination that we have failed to properly disclose information relating to replagal and the status of the fda s approval process for replagal or that there were improper transactions in our securities  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and other sanctions 
an adverse determination could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
however  at this time  we cannot accurately predict the outcome of this proceeding 
in addition  even if we are successful  this investigation may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running our business 
we may become involved in additional and expensive patent litigation or other proceedings 
the biotechnology industry has been characterized by significant litigation  and other proceedings regarding patents  patent applications  and other intellectual property rights 
we may become a party to additional patent litigation and other proceedings with respect to our proteins or other technologies 
such litigation could result in liability for damages  prevent our development and commercialization efforts  and divert management s attention and resources 
an adverse outcome in any patent litigation or other proceeding involving patents could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to cease using the technology or product that is at issue or to license the technology or product from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms  or at all 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain these costs more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop  manufacture  and market products  form strategic alliances  and compete in the marketplace 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain patent protection for our discoveries  the value of our technology and products may be adversely affected 
our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our processes and products in the united states and other countries 
the patent situation in the field of biotechnology generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
we may not be issued patents relating to our technology 
even if issued  patents may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented 
our patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology 
because some patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until patents issue  third parties may have filed or maintained patent applications for technology used by us or covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of these applications 
as a result  third parties could assert claims against us concerning our gene activation or other technology 
we may not hold proprietary rights to certain product patents  process patents  and use patents related to our products or their methods of manufacture 
in some cases  these patents may be owned or controlled by third parties 
as a result  we may be required to obtain licenses under third party patents to market certain of our potential products 
if licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms  we may not be able to market these products 
if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know how  the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected 
we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology  processes  and know how 
we seek to protect this information in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  and other third party contractors 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
if we fail to comply with our obligations under the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from third parties  we could lose license rights 
we are a party to over patent licenses under which we have acquired rights to proprietary technology of third parties  including a license to patents related to is  and expect to enter into additional patent licenses in the future 
these licenses impose various commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  insurance  and other obligations on us 
if we fail to comply with these obligations  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license and we could lose our license to use the acquired rights 
if these rights are lost  we may not be able to market products that were covered by the license 
business risks our revenue from product sales is dependent on the commercial success of replagal 
replagal is our only commercial product 
we expect that replagal will account for all of our product sales into at least the commercial success of replagal will depend on its acceptance by physicians  patients and other key decision makers for the treatment of fabry disease 
the commercial success of replagal will also depend in part upon replagal receiving marketing approval in japan and other countries 
as noted above  we have ceased our efforts to seek the approval of replagal in the united states 
our revenue from sales of replagal and our cash held by tkt europe are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
we have exposure to currency risk for replagal sales in europe 
country by country pricing of replagal was initially established as the local currency equivalent of between approximately  and  per patient per year for an average patient weighing kilograms 
the price generally remains fixed in the local currencies and varies in united states dollars with exchange rate fluctuations 
since the approval of replagal in august  the united states dollar has weakened substantially versus most european currencies  including the euro  which has resulted in increased revenues for us from sales of replagal 
if the united 
table of contents states dollar were to strengthen versus these currencies  this currency fluctuation would adversely impact our replagal product sales 
foreign currency fluctuations favorably contributed million to product sales for the year ended december  as compared to the same period of we also have exposure to currency risk for cash and cash equivalents held by tkt europe  which are primarily denominated in swedish krona  british pound and euro 
any change in the value of the us dollar as compared to these foreign currencies may have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
for example  a hypothetical percent increase in currency rates relative to the us dollar would result in an approximate million decrease in our cash and cash equivalents held by tkt europe as of december  the continuity of our sales of replagal in europe may be affected by our expected purchase of the holdings of the minority stockholders of our majority owned sales and marketing subsidiary in europe 
in april  we established an owned subsidiary  tkt europe  for the purpose of marketing  selling and distributing replagal in europe 
under the stockholders agreement for tkt europe  we agreed that the holders of the remaining interest in tkt europe would  with specified exceptions  manage the day to day operations of tkt europe 
as a result  our ability to successfully market and sell replagal in europe has been dependent on the efforts of the minority stockholders of tkt europe 
under the stockholders agreement for tkt europe  we are entitled to purchase the european stockholders ownership interest in tkt europe in september for a price determined in accordance with a formula 
should we not exercise that right  the european stockholders of tkt europe can require us to purchase the european stockholders ownership interest sixty days thereafter 
we currently expect that we will purchase the european stockholders interest in tkt europe for between million and million based on our current estimates for sales and expenses 
if we purchase the european stockholders interest in tkt europe or if the european stockholders exercise their contractual right to require us to purchase their interest  our ability to successfully market and sell replagal in europe would be dependent on our ability to integrate the functions of tkt europe into our infrastructure 
in addition  if we cannot retain existing marketing and sales personnel of tkt europe  it is likely that the current relationships that tkt europe maintains with patients  physicians and other key decision makers for the treatment of fabry disease would be affected  and any such changes could adversely affect our results of operations in europe  including our sales of replagal  and could result in the loss of market share in europe 
we face significant competition  which may result in others discovering  developing or commercializing products before  or more successfully  than we do 
the biotechnology industry is highly competitive and characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology firms  universities  and other research institutions 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do and are conducting extensive research and development activities on technologies and products similar to  or competitive with  ours 
we may be unable to develop technologies and products that are more clinically efficacious or cost effective than products developed by our competitors 
even if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates  many of our competitors have more extensive and established sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities than we do 
litigation with third parties  such as our litigation with amgen  could delay our time to market or preclude us from reaching the market for certain products and enable our competitors to more quickly and effectively penetrate certain markets 
therapeutics for the treatment of rare genetic diseases we believe that the primary competition with respect to our products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases is from biotechnology and smaller pharmaceutical companies 
competitors include biomarin pharmaceutical inc  actelion ltd  and genzyme 
the markets for some of the potential therapeutics for rare 
table of contents genetic diseases caused by protein deficiencies are quite small 
as a result  if competitive products exist  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
we believe that our primary competition with respect to replagal is genzyme 
replagal and fabrazyme were each granted marketing authorization in the european union and were also granted co exclusive orphan drug status in the european union for up to years 
fabrazyme has received marketing authorization and orphan drug exclusivity in the united states 
we believe that our primary competition with respect to our ga gcb product for the treatment of gaucher disease will be genzyme s product cerezyme 
gene activated versions of proteins that would compete with currently marketed proteins we have developed several gene activated protein products that would compete with proteins that are currently being marketed by third parties 
for instance  in the case of dynepo  competing products are marketed by amgen  johnson johnson  f 
hoffmann la roche ltd 
boehringer mannheim gmbh  sankyo company ltd  chugai pharmaceutical co  ltd  and the pharmaceutical division of kirin brewery co  ltd 
in japan 
many of the products against which our gene activated proteins would compete have well known brand names  have been promoted extensively  and have achieved market acceptance by third party payors  hospitals  physicians  and patients 
in addition  many of the companies that produce these protein products have patents covering techniques used to produce these products  which have often served as effective barriers to entry in the therapeutic proteins market 
as with amgen and its erythropoietin product  these companies may seek to block our entry into the market by asserting that our gene activated proteins infringe their patents 
many of these companies are also seeking to develop and commercialize new or potentially improved versions of their proteins 
gene therapy our gene therapy system will have to compete with other gene therapy systems  as well as with conventional methods of treating the disease and conditions targeted 
although no gene therapy product is currently marketed  a number of companies  including major biotechnology companies  pharmaceutical companies and development stage companies  are actively involved in this field 
the market may not be receptive to our products upon introduction 
the commercial success of any of our products for which we obtain marketing approval from the european commission  the fda  and other regulatory authorities will depend upon their acceptance by patients  the medical community and third party payors as clinically effective  safe and cost effective 
it may be difficult for us to achieve market acceptance of our products 
other factors that we believe will materially affect market acceptance of our products include the timing of the receipt of marketing approvals  the countries in which such approvals are obtained  and the safety  efficacy  convenience  and cost effectiveness of the product as compared to competitive products 
we have limited manufacturing experience and may not be able to develop the experience and capabilities needed to manufacture our products in compliance with regulatory requirements 
the manufacture of proteins is complicated and technical 
we have limited manufacturing experience 
in order to continue to develop products  apply for regulatory approvals  and commercialize our products  we will need to develop  contract for  or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities 
we have 
table of contents manufactured  and plan to continue in the future to manufacture  the bulk drug substance for our products for preclinical testing  clinical trials  and commercial sale 
any manufacturing of our products must comply with gmp as required by the countries in which we intend to sell our products 
before approving an application for marketing authorization for a product  the fda  the european commission  or any other equivalent foreign regulatory agency will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured 
if we or our third party manufacturers do not comply with applicable gmp  such regulatory agency may refuse to approve our application for marketing authorization 
once the regulatory agency approves a product  we or our third party manufacturers must continue to comply with gmp 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to maintain compliance with gmp  adverse consequences can result  including suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market  operating restrictions  and the imposition of civil and criminal penalties 
we are developing new manufacturing processes to manufacture bulk drug substance for replagal and for is 
following the development of these new processes  we will need to obtain regulatory approval of these new processes before we may manufacture our products using these new processes 
in some of our manufacturing processes  we use bovine derived serum sourced from canada and the united states 
the discovery of cattle in both canada and the united states with bovine spongiform encephalopathy  or mad cow disease  could cause the regulatory agencies in some countries to impose restrictions on our products  or prohibit us from using our products at all in such countries 
we are incurring significant costs to expand our manufacturing facility 
any delays in completing the renovations to our facility or obtaining re approval of our facility following completion of the renovations could adversely affect our ability to supply the bulk drug substance needed to manufacture our products 
we are investing substantial funds to expand the capacity of our alewife manufacturing facility in cambridge  massachusetts and to configure the facility for the production at a commercial scale of products other than replagal 
in anticipation of these renovations  in the third quarter of  we ceased all manufacturing operations at our alewife facility 
we expect to complete these renovations in the first half of and recommence manufacturing operations in the second half of following completion of these renovations  the appropriate regulatory authorities  including the european commission  will need to re inspect and re approve the alewife facility before we can produce bulk drug substance at the alewife facility for commercial sale and clinical trials 
if we are unable to successfully complete our renovations in a timely manner or to obtain regulatory approval of the alewife facility  our ability to supply our products for commercial sale and clinical use  including replagal  is and ga gcb  could be interrupted and our sales of replagal and the timing of our is or ga gcb clinical trials could be adversely affected 
we also plan to use the alewife facility to manufacture is and ga gcb for commercial use if and when such products are approved for commercialization 
if we are unable to successfully manufacture these products in our alewife facility  we may not be able to supply patients with is or ga gacb or complete our clinical trials 
we depend on third party contract manufacturers for various aspects of the manufacture of our products  including the preparation and packaging of tkt manufactured bulk drug substance into finished product 
if these manufactures fail to meet our requirements  our product development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed 
to the extent that we are a party to manufacturing arrangements with third parties  we are dependent upon these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable government regulations 
for instance  we rely on contract manufacturing arrangements with third parties with respect to various aspects of the manufacture of replagal  is  and ga gcb  other than the manufacture of the bulk drug substance for such products  including the preparation and packaging of tkt manufactured bulk drug substance into finished product 
each of these manufacturing arrangements relates to only some aspects of the manufacturing process 
in the event that any one of these manufacturers fails to or is unable to 
table of contents comply with its obligations under its manufacturing agreement with us  and if the manufacturer s failure materially delays the ultimate production of replagal  is  or ga gcb and adversely affects our inventory levels  our sales of replagal or the timing of our is or ga gcb clinical trials could be adversely affected 
in addition  the value of the inventory under the control of these third party contract manufacturers far exceeds the amount of liability such third parties are willing to assume for their negligence 
in the event that inventory in the possession of one of these third party manufacturers is damaged  we could face significant financial losses and we could also experience an interruption in supply which could have a significant long term affect on our sales 
under our collaborative agreement with aventis  aventis is responsible for the manufacture of dynepo for clinical trials and commercial sales and is also responsible for conducting future clinical trials and commercial sales 
we are not a party to any other arrangements relating to the manufacture of dynepo and  as a result  we are dependent on aventis and its third party manufacturer for the manufacture of dynepo 
there are a limited number of third party manufacturers capable of manufacturing our protein products with a limited amount of production capacity 
as a result  we may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate manufacturing capacity for our needs 
if we are unable to obtain or maintain contract manufacturing of these products  or to do so on commercially reasonable terms  we may not be able to complete development of these products or market them 
if we fail to manage our inventory correctly  we could experience supply shortages or a significant build up of high cost products and raw materials 
manufacture of proteins  including our products and potential products  is expensive and requires lengthy production cycle times 
we build inventory of both bulk drug substance and of finished product in order to ensure the adequate supply to patients of our products and potential products  including replagal and is 
accordingly  we have significant capital invested in inventory because of the high cost of manufacturing protein products  including replagal and is 
furthermore  much of our inventory is stored in a single facility 
however  we have limited experience in managing our supply for replagal and our other potential products 
if we fail to keep an adequate inventory of our products  it is possible that patients could miss treatments  which could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our products and on our clinical trials 
conversely  if we are unable to sell our high cost inventory in a timely manner  or if our high cost inventory were to be destroyed or expire  we could experience cash flow difficulties as well as losses 
some of the raw materials used to manufacture our products are expensive and are available from a small number of suppliers 
if we fail to keep an adequate inventory of our raw materials  it is possible that we would be unable to manufacture our products in a timely manner 
conversely  if we are unable to use our high cost raw materials  or if our high cost raw materials were to be destroyed or expire  we could experience cash flow difficulties as well as losses 
if we fail to obtain reimbursement  or an adequate level of reimbursement  by third party payors in a timely manner for our products  or if we are unable to collect payment in a timely manner  we may not have commercially viable markets for our products 
in certain countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and the level of reimbursement are subject to governmental control 
in some countries  it can take an extended period of time to establish and obtain reimbursement  and reimbursement approval may be required at the individual patient level  which can lead to further delays 
in addition  in some countries such as italy  spain and belgium  it can take an extended period of time to collect payment even after reimbursement has been established 
in the united states and elsewhere  the availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product 
these third party payors continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
for example  in germany  the reimbursement authority unilaterally reduced the price that it would 
table of contents reimburse for pharmaceutical products  including replagal  by six percent in and an additional ten percent in governmental and reimbursement authorities or third party payors in other countries may attempt to control costs by limiting access to pharmaceutical products such as replagal or by narrowing the class of patients for which a pharmaceutical product such as replagal may be prescribed 
if we are not able to obtain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for our products that receive marketing approval  our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected  possibly materially 
we expect that the prices for many of our products  when commercialized  including in particular our products for the treatment of rare genetic diseases  may be high compared to other pharmaceutical products 
for example  we have established pricing and reimbursement for substantially all patients receiving replagal in the european union 
country by country pricing was initially established as the local currency equivalent of between approximately  and  per patient per year for an average patient weighing kilograms 
the price generally remains fixed in the local currencies and varies in united states dollars with exchange rate fluctuations 
we may encounter particular difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pricing and reimbursement for products for which we seek a high price 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services of the united states department of health and human services has considered proposals from time to time to reduce the reimbursement rate with respect to erythropoietin 
if dynepo is approved and commercialized  adoption by the centers for medicare and medicaid services of any such proposal might have an adverse effect on the pricing of dynepo 
we also may experience pricing pressure with respect to replagal and other products for which we may obtain marketing approval due to the trend toward managed health care  the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and legislative proposals 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount 
we have limited sales and marketing experience and capabilities and will need to develop this expertise or depend on third parties to successfully sell and market our products on our behalf 
except for tkt europe with respect to the marketing and selling of replagal  we have limited sales and marketing experience and capabilities  and limited resources to devote to sales and marketing activities 
in order to market our products  including replagal  we will need to develop this experience and these capabilities or rely upon third parties  such as our collaborators  to perform these functions 
if we rely on third parties to sell  market  or distribute our products  our success will be dependent upon the efforts of these third parties in performing these functions 
in many instances  we may have little or no control over the activities of these third parties in selling  marketing  and distributing our products 
if we choose to conduct these activities directly  as we plan to do with respect to some of our potential products and with replagal following our expected purchase of the european stockholders interests in tkt europe  we may not be able to recruit and maintain an effective sales force 
competition for technical  commercial and administrative personnel is intense in our industry and we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 
while we do not feel that any single individual is indispensable  our success is highly dependent on the retention of principal members of our technical  commercial  and administrative staff 
our future growth will require hiring a significant number of qualified technical  commercial and administrative personnel 
accordingly  recruiting and retaining such personnel in the future will be critical to our success 
there is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities 
if we are not able to continue to attract and retain  on acceptable terms  the qualified personnel necessary for the continued development of our business  we may not be able to sustain our operations or grow 

table of contents we depend on our collaborators to develop  conduct clinical trials of  obtain regulatory approvals for  and manufacture  distribute  market and sell products on our behalf and their efforts may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
we are parties to collaborative agreements with third parties relating to certain of our principal products 
we are relying on genzyme to develop and commercialize is in japan and certain other countries in asia  on aventis to develop  conduct clinical trials of  obtain regulatory approvals for  and manufacture  market  and sell dynepo in the united states and europe  and sumitomo to develop and commercialize replagal in japan  korea  china and taiwan 
we also use third party distributors to distribute our products in many areas of the world including australia  canada  europe  and israel 
our collaborators may not devote the resources necessary or may otherwise be unable or unwilling to complete development and commercialization of these potential products 
our existing collaborations are subject to termination without cause on short notice under specified circumstances 
in some cases  we may not receive payments contemplated in the agreements with our collaborators if our collaborators fail to achieve certain regulatory and commercial milestones 
our existing collaborations and any future collaborative arrangements with third parties may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
factors that may affect the success of our collaborations include the following our collaborators may be pursuing alternative technologies or developing alternative products  either on their own or in collaboration with others  that may be competitive with the product as to which they are collaborating with us or that could affect our collaborative partners commitment to the collaboration with us  reductions in marketing or sales efforts or a discontinuation of marketing or sales of our products by our collaborators would reduce our revenues  which will be based on a percentage of net sales by the collaborator  under our collaboration agreements  we cannot conduct specified types of research and development in the field that is the subject of the collaboration 
these agreements have the effect of limiting the areas of research and development that we may pursue  either alone or in cooperation with third parties  our collaborators may underfund or not commit sufficient resources to the testing  marketing  distribution or other development of our products  our collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or they may utilize our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential liability  our collaborators may terminate their collaborations with us  as aventis has done with respect to our ga gcsf product  which could make it difficult for us to attract new collaborators or adversely affect the perception of us in the business and financial communities  and our collaborators may pursue higher priority programs or change the focus of their development programs  which could affect the collaborator s commitment to us 
if third parties on whom we rely for clinical trials do not perform as contractually required or as we expect  we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates  and our business may suffer 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval for our products 
we depend on independent clinical investigators  contract research organizations and other third party service providers in the conduct of the clinical trials of our product candidates and expect to continue to do so 
we rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials  but do not control many aspects of their activities 
for example  the investigators are not our employees 
however  we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial 
third parties may not complete activities on schedule  or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols 
the failure 
table of contents of these third parties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the development  approval and commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be exposed to product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate product liability insurance 
our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the manufacturing  testing  and marketing of human therapeutic products 
we maintain clinical trial liability insurance and product liability insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable 
this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations 
we may not be able to obtain additional insurance or maintain insurance on acceptable terms or at all 
moreover  any insurance that we do obtain may not provide adequate protection against potential liabilities 
if we are unable to obtain insurance at acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  we will be exposed to significant liabilities  which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position 
these liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
if we fail to obtain marketing authorizations in a timely manner  our costs associated with clinical trials will increase 
after completion of a clinical trial designed to show safety or efficacy  we often enroll patients taking our products in maintenance clinical trials in which these patients continue to receive treatment with our products pending approval for marketing authorization in the relevant jurisdiction 
the costs associated with maintaining open ended maintenance clinical trials can be significant  and if we fail to obtain marketing authorizations in a timely manner for the product being tested in such trials  our costs associated with these maintenance clinical trials could increase 
financing risks we have not been profitable and expect to continue to incur substantial losses 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we had net losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect that we will continue to incur substantial losses and that  until we have substantial product sales  our cumulative losses will continue to increase 
we recorded million in product sales for the year ended december  and million in product sales in we expect that the losses that we incur will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
we will need additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain 
if we do not obtain additional financing  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
we expect that our existing capital resources  together with anticipated proceeds from collections on existing and future accounts receivable on product sales  anticipated cash payments under collaborative agreements  and interest income  will be sufficient to fund our operations into and our expected buyout of the european stockholders interest in tkt europe for between million and million 
our cash requirements for operating activities  financing activities and investment activities have exceeded our internally generated funds 
we expect that our cash requirements for such activities will continue to exceed our internally generated funds until we are able to generate substantial product sales 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the timing and amount of replagal product sales  as well as the cash collections on receivables  continued progress in our research and development programs  particularly is  the scope and results of our clinical trials  
table of contents the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of expansion of tkt s internal manufacturing facilities  the inherent variability of biological manufacturing activities  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for sales denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  the quality and timeliness of the performance of third party suppliers  the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the outcome of pending purported class action and other related  or potentially related  actions and the litigation costs with respect to such actions  the timing and cost of tkt s purchase of the minority interest in tkt europe  the outcome of the sec investigation  and tkt s ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements 
because we do not expect to reach profitability until the end of  at the earliest  if at all  we will need to seek additional funding to fund our operations 
we may do so through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain additional financing  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our then existing stockholders will result 
in addition  the terms of the financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of such stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  or products which we would otherwise pursue on our own 
our stock price has been and may in the future be volatile  which could lead to losses by investors 
our stock has been and in the future may be subject to substantial price volatility  which may prevent you from reselling our common stock at or above the price you paid for it 
the value of your investment could decline due to the effect of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors  disclosure of results of clinical testing or regulatory proceedings by us or our competitors  results of litigation  the timing  amount and receipt of revenue from sales of our products and margins on sales of our products  governmental regulation and approvals  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concerns as to the safety of products developed by us or the fields of study in which we work  and general market conditions 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile 
moreover  broad market and industry fluctuations that are not within our control may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
during the period from january  to december   the closing sale price of our common stock ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
you must be willing to bear the risk of fluctuations in the price of our common stock and the risk that the value of your investment in our stock could decline 

table of contents our corporate governance structure  including provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  our stockholder rights plan and delaware law  may prevent a change in control or management that stockholders may consider desirable 
section of the delaware general corporation law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company or discourage a third party from attempting to take over our company these provisions include the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings  and the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of us or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock
