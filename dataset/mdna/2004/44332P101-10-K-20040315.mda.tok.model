overview hub is a leading north american insurance brokerage that has grown rapidly since its formation in through mergers  acquisitions and organic growth 
we provide a broad array of property and casualty  life and health  employee benefits  investment and risk management products and services through offices located in the united states and canada 
we are pursuing a growth strategy that includes expansion of our geographic footprint across the united states and deeper penetration of the insurance brokerage market in both the united states and canada 
both acquisitions and internal growth are core components of our strategic plan for revenue expansion 
we anticipate that increases in revenue  higher revenue per employee  expense control and more advantageous commission arrangements with insurance firms will be instrumental in margin expansion efforts 
hub international limited annual report december  as of december   our operations included regional hub brokerages five in the united states and five in canada and more than offices staffed by approximately  people 
our strategic plan calls for the addition of approximately additional us hubs to extend our geographic footprint 
brokerages large enough to be considered hubs will generally have annual revenue in excess of million 
in addition to larger  hub acquisitions by the parent corporation  each regional hub is tasked with pursuing smaller  fold in acquisitions that either expand its geographic penetration or add new specialization or expertise to the regional operation 
we generally acquire larger  hub brokerages  for a combination of cash and stock 
although there are variations in the purchase terms for each hub  our goal is to pay of the hub purchase price in our common stock  while setting escrow periods of up to years for the sellers to hold these shares 
we believe the use of escrowed stock in major acquisitions creates increased alignment of interests between senior managers and the public shareholders of the corporation 
we have paid all cash for the acquisition of certain brokerages  and may pay an all cash purchase price for brokerages in the future 
as of december   senior managers of the company and its hubs owned approximately  shares  or of shares outstanding  while all employees as a group held approximately  shares  or of total shares outstanding 
during the three years ended december   we acquired brokerages in the united states and another brokerages in canada  adding a combined million to our revenue as of the dates of acquisition 
of these acquisitions  were regional hubs  all based in the united states 
united states revenue has grown to of our total in from in  reflecting primarily acquisition growth but also organic growth and our strategic plan to use acquisitions to expand across the united states 
organic growth is similar to the same store sales calculation used by retailers 
it includes revenue growth from units included in our financial statements for at least months 
because we apply the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  acquired brokerages financial results are included only from the date of acquisition 
we acquired brokerages with aggregate annual revenue of million in  down from approximately million of acquired revenue in the slower pace of acquisitions in resulted from a number of factors  including competition for brokerages by banks and other buyers willing to acquire insurance brokers at higher valuations than we and most industry peers have been willing to pay 
our management believes pricing discipline is a key to successful acquisition efforts and did not complete potential acquisitions that did not meet our pricing criteria 
during  for example  we considered an acquisition of a large brokerage firm in chicago  but decided against the potential transaction as a result of our due diligence process 
this process led to diversion of a significant amount of management s time  which weighed against other acquisition efforts 
we still continue to have a goal of acquiring an average of hub operations per year  increasing our base of us hubs to from the current six 
acquisitions will be driven by opportunity  pricing and fit  however  not by a rigid timetable 
our revenue base is diversified across a large number of insurance products and services  including commercial insurance property and casualty employee benefits risk management services business property auto and trucking fleets technology intellectual property natural disaster workers compensation liability surety bonds business income accounts receivable environmental risks group life and health employment issues human resources retirement plans contract review claims management risk finance structuring exposure evaluation coverage analysis contract review annual report december  hub international limited personal insurance property and casualty life  health and financial home personal property auto and recreational vehicles travel accident and trip cancellation disability life investments financial planning commercial lines have increased as a percentage of our total revenue  increasing to in from in  largely as a result of our more rapid expansion in the united states  where middle market companies and other commercial clients are the primary source of revenue 
in  commercial lines constituted of us revenue and of canadian revenue 
in british columbia canada  we are the largest broker of government underwritten auto insurance  a personal line 
in addition  canada s public health care system eliminates a significant portion of the demand for employer provided health insurance  a major commercial product line for us in the united states 
we employ a number of distribution channels to deliver products and services to clients 
among the distribution channels we employ are retail sales and service centers that target middle market companies  providing a broad range of property and casualty insurance  life and health insurance  risk management and financial services  retail call centers provide sales and services by telephone to individuals or members of employee groups  associations  affinity groups and specific communities 
we operate call centers in chicago  and in saint john  new brunswick and chilliwack  british columbia  wholesale life and financial services centers  known as managing general agents  provide life and financial products and expertise to independent agents on a wholesale basis from our locations in vancouver  calgary  montreal and toronto  wholesale property and casualty insurance centers provide products  international risk solutions  captive management programs and specialty lines to independent brokers and corporations in north america and globally from offices in new york  toronto  montreal and vancouver 
in addition  we are a member of the worldwide broker network  a consortium of international brokerages which we can access to service us or canadian clients who require insurance internationally 
because we have a diverse mix of products  services  insurer relationships and distribution channels  revenue and profitability levels are not usually highly susceptible to major changes as a result of a single product or service 
an exception occurred in see us results on page however  general economic trends can influence both overall insurance rates and commissions and availability or costs of individual types of coverage 
during the s  for example  insurance rates were generally considered low  or soft  as insurance companies sought to maximize the flow of premium dollars that they could invest profitability in a rising stock market and in other investments 
beginning in  as return on investment began to shrink  insurance rates began to rise  or harden  a pace that accelerated rapidly after the terrorist attack of september  during the past two years  premium rates have remained firm for most types of coverage  rising to per year in many cases 
during  the canadian market remained firm  but the us market experienced some softening of premium rates for property and casualty coverage 
rates for liability  health and other types of coverage continued to experience increases however 
looking toward  we anticipate some continued softening in the us market and the beginning of softening in the canadian market as the year progresses 
for us  as for other brokers  rising rates can present both positive and negative effects 
rising premiums usually yield stronger commission levels  if the insurance buyer maintains its coverage levels 
however  many insurance buyers will respond to rising rates by reducing total coverage  often by raising deductibles  reducing limits of coverage  or by leaving some risks uninsured 
in addition  a weak economic environment often leads to lower sales and employee headcounts at client companies  leading in turn to reduced demand for employee benefits  liability and other types of coverage tied to business activity levels 
our ability to achieve organic revenue growth is not solely dependent on hub international limited annual report december  rising or declining rates  but results from a more complex mixture of general economic growth  access to coverage from insurers and marketing sales expertise 
our strategic plan has traditionally included a highly decentralized structure that offered a large degree of autonomy to each regional hub operation 
we have sought to acquire strong businesses and retain the services and commitment of the management teams that built those businesses successfully 
decentralization has been a core component of this growth plan 
as the company continues to grow  however  it is likely that added investment will be made to coordinate more functions from the head office  enhancing the potential for cross selling  international coordination  marketing efficiency  total expense management and financial controls 
because we are a service organization  compensation and other personnel costs make up the largest component of total expenses in property and equipment are comprised primarily of furniture  computer systems and office equipment 
therefore  hub s capital resources  including external borrowings  internally generated cash flow and issuance of common shares  are targeted primarily toward acquisitions 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we achieved growth in revenue and profitability in although the pace of acquisitions did not match that of  we benefited from strong organic growth rates in most hubs  contributions from brokerages acquired in and the currency exchange benefits of a strengthening canadian dollar 
overall  our management believes the company made strong progress on several fronts in  including increased penetration of the commercial middle market in british columbia  expansion of the professional liability practice in chicago and growth of the wholesale brokerage business in new york and toronto 
as a result of these and other factors  we reported a revenue increase to million in  while net earnings increased to million 
diluted earnings per share increased to from 
the slower rate of growth in diluted earnings per share as compared to growth in revenue and net earnings reflected a larger number of average shares outstanding  resulting from both our us ipo in june and the use of common shares in both acquisitions and compensation programs 
annual report december  hub international limited the table below shows a breakdown of our revenue by segment and type for including organic growth for in thousands of us dollars  except percentages revenue adjustment for total net total net acquisitions organic organic change growth and disposals growth growth total commission income contingent commissions and volume overrides other income total us commission income contingent commissions and volume overrides other income total canada commission income contingent commissions and volume overrides other income total of the million in new revenue we reported  million  or reflected growth through acquisition  while million  or resulted from organic growth 
by comparison  acquired units added million  or of s sales growth  while organic growth contributed million  or of our revenue increases 
organic growth figures for both revenue and earnings include the impact of foreign exchange rate changes between the us and canadian dollars 
in  the rise of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar contributed percentage points of our organic growth rate in revenue 
commission income  which usually ranges from to of the premium charged by insurers  provides approximately of our revenue base 
in addition to these core commissions  the company derives revenue from volume overrides additional compensation paid by insurance companies to brokerages on the basis of the overall volume of business a brokerage places with the insurance company 
contingent commissions additional compensation based on the profit an insurance company makes on the book of business a brokerage places with the insurance company 
other income comprised of fees and interest income  including income earned while we hold client premiums on behalf of insurance companies 
volume overrides and contingent commissions are typically paid in the first or second quarter  based on prior year performance 
the sharp increase in contingent commissions and volume overrides in reflected increased profitability of business placed by us at higher premium rates and increased concentrations of some placements among a group of selected insurers 
in addition to the variations that can result from changes in organic growth rates  acquisitions and other variables related to operations  both and results included a number of factors that can complicate any efforts at hub international limited annual report december  direct comparisons 
the following chart shows the net earnings and diluted per share impacts that several of these factors had over the past two years 
they are shown here as an added disclosure to increase investor understanding 
in thousands of us dollars  except per share amounts net earnings diluted eps net earnings canadian gaap impact of foreign exchange life insurance proceeds non cash stock based compensation adjusted results net earnings canadian gaap gain on sale of old lyme non cash stock based compensation adjusted results as shown above  we benefited from both a stronger canadian dollar and the receipt of life insurance proceeds in  while results were strengthened by the sale of two insurance subsidiaries 
the impact of foreign exchange on earnings was insignificant 
in addition  included a full year s amortization of non cash stock based compensation  versus which included only six months of amortization 
excluding the effects of these items  net income would have increased in  versus under canadian gapp  and diluted earnings per share would have increased in  versus under canadian gaap 
changes in currency exchange rates are not an unusual item 
because we derive our revenue from both the united states and canada and do not use derivatives to manage our canadian pre tax income  foreign exchange fluctuations will continue to impact our results 
we have highlighted the impact of these changes because currency translation effects can lead to reported results that are less meaningful than local currency results as an indicator of underlying operations 
this year the strength of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar had a positive impact on our results 
a decline would have a negative effect 
see market risk 
us results us revenue grew to million  or of revenue  in  due to both organic growth and the contributions of operations acquired in acquisitions added million to revenue of the increase while organic growth provided million  or of revenue growth 
our us operations posted an organic growth rate of in  an decrease from in core commission income increased  while contingent commissions and volume overrides grew 
during we experienced an unusual timing issue at a single hub that provides lender placed auto insurance coverage for financial institutions 
lender placed coverage is primarily collision coverage on automobiles financed through a financial institution 
this is a high volume business that is generally very profitable for us 
however  in the third quarter of  two financial institutions adjusted their credit policies  leading to cancellation of several quarters worth of policies in a single quarter resulting in revenue being reduced by approximately million 
excluding the impact of this product line  us organic growth was in during  us insurance premium rates remained strong or hard for most product lines  although rates for property coverage showed only modest increases as the year progressed 
hard insurance pricing in contributed strongly to a significant increase in contingent profitability income from insurers in  as these insurers benefited from the near term impact of higher rates implemented in our management believes contingent commissions are likely to rise or decline only marginally in versus levels  reflecting a relative moderation in the pace of rate increases 
in the united states  our brokerages benefited from new business generation  additional revenue from businesses acquired during and moderate premium rate increases 
while higher premium rates on most product lines annual report december  hub international limited added nominally to total premium amounts  client response to higher rates often included a reduction in total coverage  increasing deductibles and other cost savings techniques 
in addition  the relative weakness in the us economy led to declines in sales levels and staff headcount at many of our clients 
many products  including employee benefits and product liability coverage  are linked closely to the level of business activity at our clients 
a weak economy reduces total risk  total coverage and total premiums for these clients 
as a result  our management believes an economic recovery that adds jobs and revenue at our client could make a meaningful contribution to organic growth in in addition  stronger revenue and earnings of our clients could lead these clients to reinstate coverages or lower deductibles  which also would have a beneficial impact on total premiums and commissions 
canadian results canadian revenue grew to million  or of consolidated revenue  in  primarily as a result of a strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar as well as organic growth 
canadian brokerages posted organic growth of  of which percentage points reflected a stronger canadian dollar 
acquisitions added only million  or  of the revenue increase  reflecting a slower pace of fold in acquisitions in canada than in the united states 
apart from foreign currency gains  in canada  our brokerages benefited from strong organic growth and a sustained pace of increases in insurance premium rates 
canadian rate trends have trailed those of the united states  leading to expectations that canadian premium rates will continue to be firm for much of  with some softening as the year progresses 
because canadian revenue includes a lower percentage of commercial business and more personal lines  any acceleration in economic growth that adds to payrolls is not expected to have as strong a benefit in canada as in the united states 
the strong rate of organic growth in canada reflected both increased market penetration and continued strength in premium rates 
our strong relationships with and access to insurers in canada proved to be an important competitive advantage in  leading to increased sales to clients who were unable to obtain coverage from other sources 
as was the case in the united states  canadian operations benefited strongly from an increase in contingent commissions and volume overrides  which grew in  versus a decline of in compensation expense the majority of our expenses are related to compensation  which increased in to million 
as a percentage of revenue  compensation increased to from in  due in large part to an increase in non cash stock based compensation 
total compensation includes both cash based salaries and benefits and non cash stock based compensation 
cash based compensation grew to million in  while non cash stock based compensation increased to million 
of in thousands change revenue compensation comparison compensation cash non cash stock based compensation total we have undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce or maintain compensation expense 
during  members of the executive management group agreed to accept of their earned bonuses in the form of stock options  rather than cash 
at the close of  we obtained agreement from managers to restructure the company s management bonus agreement 
under the new agreement the non cash stock option component of the annual bonus was eliminated in exchange for restricted share units to be issued in the first quarter of in addition  whereas the management bonus agreement was previously contractual in nature  the restructured plan is no longer contractual and may be subject to change as we deem necessary 
management has estimated that approximately million of restricted share units will be issued in connection with the modifications 
the amount of restricted share units to be issued was based upon a multiple of the previous two years average bonus 
the restricted share units will all vest in full on january  subject to continued employment 
although the impact of this change is hub international limited annual report december  expected to be earnings neutral in  the long term effect is to reduce compensation costs as a percentage of revenue 
in addition to cash compensation  we have employed non cash compensation tools such as stock options  restricted shares and restricted share units for senior employees 
in response to investor interest in the true impact of these costs  we began recognizing the expense of non cash stock based compensation during we recognized million of expense for the full year in  including both stock options and restricted share units  versus million of expense for two quarters of options vest evenly over three years and expire in seven years from issuance 
shares derived from the options are held in escrow for a period of five years from the date the options are granted  subject to early release in certain circumstances 
restricted share units vest over periods ranging from months to months 
our policy is to expense the fair value of non cash stock based compensation to employees over the period in which entitlement to the compensation vests 
the amount of expense recognized in each quarter related to stock options will vary with respect to exercise and forfeiture of options 
in total  as of december   we had issued and outstanding approximately million stock options at a weighted average exercise price of 
our closing share price on the new york stock exchange was on december  selling  occupancy and administration expense selling  occupancy and administration expense increased to million in as a percentage of revenue  selling  occupancy and administration expense declined slightly to  versus in depreciation depreciation declined slightly to of revenue in from in the lower relative impact reflected control of capital expenditures while revenue grew 
this number is not particularly important  as our business is not driven by capital expenditures 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million from million in this decline reflected in large part the application of million in proceeds for the ipo to pay down debt 
in addition  interest expense was reduced by the benefits of performance based forgiveness of interest payments due under a loan agreement with an insurer and an interest rate swap during the third and fourth quarters of the interest rate swap effectively converted million of fixed interest rate senior notes into floating rate instruments  reducing interest expense on the senior notes by million in intangible asset amortization in january  we adopted a corporate marketing and positioning strategy to build awareness of the hub brand across all of our markets and to encourage greater coordination and collegial identity among our employees 
as part of this corporate consolidation and identity development program  we have reassigned a number of key executives to new or expanded areas of responsibility and determined that future marketing and communications will be conducted under the hub international name  rather than the traditional corporate names of acquired brokerages 
as a result  in the first quarter of certain of our subsidiaries changed their names and as a result  we will recognize a non cash impairment expense of approximately million before tax related to trademarks 
gain on put option liability in addition to the issuance of stock options  we issued put options to a number of individuals as part of the sale of their brokerages to us 
these put options allowed the former owners to require us to repurchase our shares issued to them when we acquired their brokerages 
we negotiated the cancellation of put options with one group of former owners during and negotiated the cancellation of all remaining put options during provision for income tax expense our effective tax rate increased in to from 
the difference in tax rates was affected most directly by non taxable items in both and approximately million of earnings resulting from the sale of annual report december  hub international limited two subsidiaries  old lyme insurance company of rhode island inc and old lyme insurance company  ltd 
collectively  old lyme were non taxable  while million of earnings resulting from life insurance proceeds were non taxable 
absent these two items  the tax rates were unchanged at approximately in both years 
based on existing operations  management anticipates that our effective tax rate will likely be in the range of in net earnings and earnings per share our net earnings increased to million in  primarily as a result of growth in revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  net earnings declined approximately percentage points to in from in diluted earnings per share increased at a somewhat slower rate than net earnings to  due primarily to a larger number of shares outstanding 
our use of shares as a core component of our acquisition proceeds and as a form of executive compensation has led to significant increases in the number of shares outstanding over the past few years 
in addition  we issued million common shares in our june us ipo and listing on the new york stock exchange 
the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding increased from million in to million in and million in the impact of new acquisitions on the level of weighted average diluted shares outstanding in will be determined by both the size of acquisitions and their timing within the coming year 
as shown in the table on page  net earnings increased million or per diluted share  in on the sale of two insurance subsidiaries and decreased million or per diluted share due to non cash stock based compensation 
in  diluted earnings per share increased per diluted share from life insurance proceeds and another per diluted share from foreign exchange rates and net earnings decreased million or per diluted share due to non cash stock based compensation 
excluding these effects our diluted earnings per share would have increased from in to in on a comparable basis

as part of our acquisition of kaye in  we acquired old lyme  with the intent to sell the operation and have since sold it to a subsidiary of fairfax at a purchase price equivalent to its us gaap book value as of december  of approximately million 
the sale of old lyme was completed on may  as of december   fairfax owned of our common shares 
prior to the sale  we recorded old lyme as an investment available for sale  and accordingly  its results of operations are not included in our consolidated earnings

we earn interest on these funds during the time between receipt of the cash and the time the cash is paid to insurers 
the cash held in trust is shown separately on our balance sheet 
on the statement of cash flows  changes in trust cash are included as part of the change in non cash working capital and the determination of cash provided from operating activities 
in addition to internally generated cash  we maintain two separate credit facilities revolving us dollar libor loan this undrawn facility was renegotiated in december subject to completion of the definitive amended agreement 
under the new terms  the unsecured facility totals million and bears interest at a floating rate of prime plus or basis points above libor  which were and at december  and  respectively 
the facility is available on a revolving basis for one year and expires on december   however if the revolving period is not extended  we may convert the outstanding balance under the facility to a three year non revolving term loan repayable at the end of three years with an interest rate of basis points above the canadian dollar interest swap rate 
an annual commitment fee of basis points is assessed on the unused balance 
borrowings under this facility totaled nil and million at december  and  respectively 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants governing this facility as of december  and demand us dollar base rate loan we have an undrawn million facility which expires on july  and bears interest at the bank s us base rate plus bonus points 
borrowings under this facility are repayable on demand 
in june  we completed a private placement of million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes 
the senior notes were issued in two series 
series a represents million of senior notes with interest due semi annually  and principal due of  annually  june  through june  series b represents million of senior notes with interest due semi annually  and principal due of  annually june  through june  the senior notes were sold on a private basis in the united states to institutional accredited investors 
net proceeds of the sale of the senior notes were used to pay down million of our revolving us dollar libor loan with the balance held for general corporate purposes  which may include future acquisitions 
we incurred approximately million in fees and expenses related to the offering of these notes  which were capitalized and are being amortized to expense over the term of the notes 
at december   million was outstanding under the senior notes 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants governing the senior notes 
on july   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the effect of the swap is to convert the fixed rate interest payments of and on million and million  respectively  of the senior notes in order to ensure that we pay a market related interest rate on a portion of our borrowings 
under canadian gaap  we account for the swap transaction using the synthetic instruments method under which the net interest expense on the swap and associated debt is reported in earnings as if it were a single  synthetic  financial instrument 
as at annual report december  hub international limited december   we estimate the fair value of the swap to be million  which is not recognized in these financial statements 
accordingly  million is the estimated amount that we would need to pay to terminate the swap as of december  also at december  we had outstanding a million term loan from an insurance carrier 
the terms of the loan provide for an incentive arrangement whereby a credit can be earned that will reduce annual interest payments under the loan based on target premiums placed with the carrier and reduces the principal repayment due in february based on both target premiums placed with the carrier as well as the loss ratio on premiums placed with the carrier 
credits were earned for and which reduced interest payments to zero from and  respectively 
in addition to these primary credit sources  we ended with million of subsidiary debt comprised of various notes payable  term loans and capital leases 
we intend to repay these liabilities from internally generated cash flow  existing cash balances and or borrowings under our credit facilities as the subsidiary debt becomes due during through of the outstanding subsidiary debt  million is secured by liens on certain assets of our subsidiaries 
also at december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due june  held by certain subsidiaries of fairfax the fairfax notes 
the fairfax notes are convertible by the holders at any time into our common shares at c per share 
if fairfax converted all of the fairfax notes  fairfax would own approximately of our total outstanding common shares as of december   versus the of outstanding shares held on that date 
at the close of  our cash position included approximately million deployed as working capital at the brokerage level and approximately million available for acquisitions 
it is impossible to define exactly how many acquisitions or how much new revenue could be acquired through the use of this cash  additional cash flow from operations and application of credit facilities  as acquisition pricing and other factors vary during the course of the year 
however  we intend to use common shares as compensation for approximately of the value of a hub acquisition  and generally have paid a multiple of times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization frequently referred to as ebitda for acquired brokerages 
we believe that our capital resources  including existing cash  funds generated from operations and borrowings available under credit facilities  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s financial requirements  including some strategic acquisitions  during the next twelve months 
we may finance acquisitions with available cash or an existing credit facility  but may  depending on the number and size of future acquisitions  need to supplement our finance requirements with the proceeds from debt financing  the issuance of additional equity securities  or a combination of both 
our debt to capitalization ratio defined as debt expressed as a percentage of debt and shareholders equity decreased to at december   compared with at december  if all lines of credit and other loan facilities were fully utilized by the company at december   our ratio of debt to capitalization would have been  which is below the range to that our management believes is suitably conservative for our business model 
under our loan covenants  our debt to capitalization ratio must be maintained below the level 
as of december   we were in compliance with the financial covenants under all of our debt instruments 
hub international limited annual report december  contingent obligations the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period on less than after in thousands total demand year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations executive share purchase plan loans total acquisitions in connection with the acquisition of hooper hayes and associates  inc  in we issued  shares the retractable shares that are being held in escrow subject to release over a period of three years upon the satisfaction of certain performance targets 
as of december    shares have been released from escrow 
as part of the negotiations of the contingent consideration for jp flanagan corporation flanagan total additional consideration of  of our common shares were earned at december  valued at approximately  based on the closing price of the shares at december  on the nyse 
the common shares have been recorded as issuable shares and included in shareholders equity and goodwill has been increased by the same amount at december  also as part of the negotiations the former owner agreed to relinquish his rights to put options on the  shares previously issued as well as on shares issued as contingent consideration 
in addition we expect to issue non cash stock based compensation in the form of  restricted share units in the first quarter of half of these restricted share units will vest in years and the balance will vest in years 
in connection with other various acquisitions completed through december   we may be obligated to pay contingent consideration up to a maximum sum of approximately million cash and million in common shares based upon the acquired brokerages achieving certain targets 
the contingent payments are payable on various dates through september  according to the terms and conditions of each purchase agreement 
any additional consideration will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill once the contingency is resolved 
in connection with contingent consideration earned as at december   the financial statements reflect a liability to pay cash of and to issue common shares valued at approximately as of december  other in connection with our executive share purchase plan  under certain circumstances  we may be obligated to purchase loans for officers  directors and employees from a canadian chartered bank totaling  and  as of december  and respectively  to assist in purchasing our common shares 
as collateral  the employees have pledged  and  common shares as of december  and  respectively  which have a market value of  and  as of december  and  respectively 
interest on the loans in the amount of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  was paid by us and is included in compensation expense 
we no longer make loans to our executive officers and directors 
we have undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce and maintain compensation expense 
during  members of the executive management group agreed to accept of their earned bonuses in the form of stock options  rather than cash 
at the close of  we obtained agreement from managers to restructure the company s management bonus agreement to reduce total compensation expense over the long term 
under the new agreement the non cash stock option component of the annual bonus was eliminated in exchange for restricted annual report december  hub international limited share units to be issued in the first quarter of in addition  whereas the management bonus agreement was previously contractual in nature  the restructured plan is no longer contractual and may be subject to change as we deem necessary 
our management has estimated that approximately million of restricted share units will be issued in connection with the modifications 
the amount of restricted share units to be issued was based upon a multiple of the previous two years average bonus 
the restricted share units will vest in full on july   subject to continued employment of the awardee 
although the impact of this change is expected to be earnings neutral in  the long term effect is intended to be a slower rate of increase in compensation expense relative to revenue growth 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to various claims and lawsuits consisting primarily of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance 
in the opinion of our management  the ultimate resolution of all asserted and potential claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
shareholders equity restricted share units 
we committed to award  under our equity incentive plan  an aggregate of  restricted shares that would be paid for by the participants none of whom are members of our senior management or directors with loans either from us or from a bank guaranteed by us 
in addition  we committed to award an aggregate of  restricted share units that would be exercisable for common shares  without payment of cash consideration 
on june   we awarded  restricted share units in satisfaction of substantially all of the above mentioned commitments 
the restricted share units vest over periods ranging from months to months 
in the first quarter of   restricted share units were issued in connection with the restructure of our management bonus agreement and  restricted share units were issued in connection with the renegotiation of contingent consideration for flanagan 
share repurchases 
for the year ended december   no common shares were repurchased by us  other than  common shares under the executive share purchase plan 
shares reserved for issuance 
as of december   million common shares were reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plan 
as of december   an aggregate of approximately million stock options and restricted share units were outstanding which would reduce such shares reserved for issuance 
the issuance of approximately  additional restricted share units in the first quarter of will also reduce such shares reserved for issuance 
shareholders equity increased by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  this increase resulted from net earnings of million  an increase in contributed surplus of million related primarily to non cash stock based compensation expense  million increase due to the release of the put option liability  million due to shares issued in conjunction with purchase of subsidiaries and other items  million due to shares issued in conjunction with the contingent consideration payments  as well as an increase in the cumulative translation account of million  due mainly to the strengthening of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar in the increase in shareholders equity was offset by the payment of dividends of million in  and a reduction in share capital of million as a result of a transfer from long term assets on company funded loans to executives used to purchase company shares pursuant to our executive share purchase plan 
we no longer make loans to our executive officers 
this treatment is consistent with us gaap 
market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with our senior notes due to the interest rate swap entered into in july which converted the fixed rate interest payments on the million of senior notes outstanding into floating rate payments 
at december   we had million of floating rate debt outstanding 
each basis point increase in interest rates charged on the balance of our outstanding floating rate debt as of december  will result in approximately million decrease in our earnings 
hub international limited annual report december  exchange rate sensitivity we report our revenue in us dollars 
our canadian operations earn revenue and incur expenses in canadian dollars 
given our significant canadian dollar revenue  we are sensitive to the fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
foreign currency exchange risk is the potential for loss in revenue and net income as a result of a decline in the us dollar value of canadian dollar revenue due to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar 
the canadian dollar is subject to volatility and had experienced a significant decline in its value compared to the us dollar in and but has increased significantly in value throughout at december  and one us dollar equaled and canadian dollars  respectively 
the table below summarizes the effect that a decline or increase in the value of the canadian dollar would have had on our revenue  net earnings and cumulative translation account for the twelve months ended december   and in thousands of us dollars  except percentages revenue net earnings cumulative translation account the increasing proportion of our revenue derived from our us operations and earned in us dollars has  in part  offset the potential risk of a decline in the canadian dollar 
we expect that the proportion of revenue earned in us dollars will continue to increase  further mitigating our foreign currency exchange sensitivity 
we have not entered into  and do not intend to enter into  foreign currency forward exchange agreements 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets arising from acquisitions consist of the following in thousands of us dollars customer relationships non competition covenants trademarks goodwill accumulated amortization total we completed our impairment testing on the balance of goodwill and intangible assets as of january   and based on the testing performed  no impairment losses were incurred 
the amounts allocated to customer relationships were determined by discounting the expected future net cash flows from commissions with consideration given to remaining economic lives  renewals  and associated expenses 
non competition covenants value were determined using an income approach with consideration given to economic benefits associated with having the covenants in place versus damages that would ensue absent the agreements  and in the case of trademarks  a cash flow royalty savings approach addressing the economic benefits of the trademarks to hub was used 
the balance of the excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill 
customer relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over their periods of duration  normally fifteen years 
many factors outside our control determine the persistency of our customer relationships and we cannot be sure that the value we have allocated will ultimately be realized 
non competition covenants and trademarks are intangible assets that have an indefinite life and accordingly  are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment 
when an employee leaves hub  the non competition covenant becomes effective and the value assigned is then amortized over the life of covenant 
prior to we amortized goodwill primarily over a period of forty years 
under the new accounting standards adopted in  goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated annually for annual report december  hub international limited impairment 
for the past three years ended december   our amortization has been comprised of the following in thousands of us dollars customer relationships non competition covenants goodwill total we estimate that our amortization charges for intangible assets from through for all acquisitions consummated to date will be year ended december  in thousands of us dollars customer relationships non competition covenants trademarks total related party transactions we had transactions with  and recorded revenue from  the following related parties northbridge financial corporation crum forster holdings  inc fairfax inc as of december  and  we had accounts receivable and accounts payable balances with the above related parties in the amounts of  and  for  respectively  and  and  for  respectively 
all revenue and related accounts receivable and accounts payable are the result of transactions in the normal course of business 
the companies above are related through common ownership by fairfax  which owns approximately of our common shares as of december  as of december  and  long term debt related to put options of nil and  respectively  and subordinated convertible debentures of  at the end of both years  are due to related parties 
during  and  we incurred expenses related to rental of premises from related parties in the amount of   and  respectively 
at december  and  we also had accounts receivable due from related parties in the amount of  and  respectively  of which the majority were loans to employees to enable them to purchase our common shares 
of the accounts receivable  as of december  and   and  respectively  were related to company loans to employees to purchase shares under our executive share purchase plan 
as collateral  the employees have pledged  and  common shares as of december  and  respectively  which have a market value of  and  as of december  and  respectively 
off balance sheet transactions under canadian gapp  we account for the interest rate swap transaction which converted fixed rate interest payments of and on the senior notes of million and million  respectively  using the synthetic instruments method 
under this method  we report in earnings the net interest expense on the swap and associated debt as if it were a single  synthetic  financial instrument 
the fair value of the swap  estimated at million is not hub international limited annual report december  recognized in our canadian gaap financial statements 
under us gaap  we have designated the swap transaction of a hedge of changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt caused by changes in interest rates and record the swap on our us gaap balance sheet at is fair value 
changes in fair value of the swap are reported in earnings 
changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged which are attributable to changes in interest rates are recognized in earnings by adjustment of the carrying amount of the debt 
we have no other material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting polices are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts and policies  our observance of trends in the insurance industry  information provided by our clients and information provided by outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include the recognition of commission income  the allocation of the purchase price of an acquisition  the measurement of goodwill and other intangibles and related impairment evaluation  and the valuation of stock based compensation 
these policies are discussed below 
recognition of commission income we recognize commission income and fees as of the effective date of our client s policy unless information is not available relating to the determination of their policy premiums  in which case we recognize commission income and fees related to that policy when that information becomes available and the revenue can be reasonably determined 
we maintain an allowance for estimated policy cancellations and commission returns based upon the application of historical policy cancellation and commission return rates to the current year revenue  adjusted for any known deviations 
the allowance for estimated policy cancellations is based on our management s judgment  and is regularly evaluated by management by taking into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and volume of policies  trends in actual and forecasted policy cancellations  and current economic conditions that may affect the likelihood of client policy changes or cancellations 
if our actual policy cancellation rates are significantly different from our historical policy cancellation rates  and those changes have not been adjusted for in the allowance  our actual commission income may be significantly different from what we estimated 
allocation of the purchase price of an acquisition the acquisition of new brokerages is a fundamental component of our strategy 
when we acquire a business  the cost of the purchase is allocated to all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values 
any excess of the cost of purchase over the net of the allocated amounts is recognized as goodwill 
for significant acquisitions  we engage qualified third party valuators to assist us in conducting asset valuations 
the fair value of assets  including intangible assets  and liabilities may be determined using a number of valuation methods including net realizable values  market prices and discounted cash flows 
the use of assumptions and estimates is inherent in each of these valuation methods 
valuation methods and their underlying assumptions and estimates are based on management s judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates  or assumptions could produce different allocations of the purchase price and  as a result  different results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets primarily represent goodwill  associated with our acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of purchase of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
the fair value of our subsidiary brokerages has been increasing primarily due to recent increases in premium rates and organic growth as previously discussed which has generally increased the commission earned by us 
annual report december  hub international limited effective january   we adopted canadian institute of chartered accountants cica accounting standards board handbook section and the us financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 which change and conform the recognition  measurement and disclosure of goodwill and other intangible assets under canadian and us gaap 
these new accounting standards require that we no longer amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we test at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit may be determined using a number of market valuation methods including quoted market prices  discounted cash flows and net realizable values 
the use of assumptions and estimates is inherent in each of these valuation techniques 
the valuation method and the underlying assumptions and estimates are based on management s judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates and assumptions could produce different results in the application of the impairment tests and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
the cost of definite lived intangible assets is amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the assets 
we regularly evaluate whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangibles  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  may warrant revision or may not be recoverable 
the estimation of the useful economic lives and the selection of estimates and assumptions used in conducting impairment tests require the exercise of judgment 
the use of different judgments  estimates and assumptions could produce different results in the application of the impairment tests of the assets and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation includes both stock options  restricted shares and restricted share units 
our accounting policy is to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation as an expense over the period in which entitlement to the compensation vests 
we measure the fair value of stock options at the date of grant of the award and recognize this amount as compensation expense over the vesting period of the options 
an alternative accounting treatment would be to follow the intrinsic value method for accounting for stock options 
we estimate the fair value of the stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make assumptions in relation to the expected term of the stock option  volatility in the price of the underlying common shares  interest rates and dividend yield 
the fair value model is particularly sensitive to the changes in the price and price volatility of our common shares 
the assumptions used are based on our management s judgment and the use of different judgments  estimates  and assumptions could produce significantly different results of fair value of the stock options and  as a result  significantly different results of operations 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements we are not aware of any new accounting pronouncements which will impact on our financial reporting
