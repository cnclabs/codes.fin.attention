item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year end our fiscal year ends on the last friday of the calendar year 
to simplify our narrative discussion  we refer to the fiscal years ended december   december   and december   as   and  respectively 
introduction and overview while fiscal was another financially challenging year overall  we ended the year with our best quarter in terms of revenues and earnings since the first quarter of  posting strong seasonal fourth quarter revenues of million and earnings of per share before adjusting for certain significant items as discussed in results of operations below 
in addition  revenues in were million  an increase of over  marking the first year of annual revenue growth since fiscal year while we are encouraged by these results  it is not yet clear whether these results represent the beginning of a positive trend or were simply an unusually strong seasonal increase in demand 
over the past three years  the conditions in the markets we serve have changed significantly  and a return to moderate revenue growth may not ensure a return to acceptable levels of profitability 
the majority of our revenues have historically been  and continue to be  driven by a relatively small number of technology focused customers in the personal computer hardware and software industries such as microsoft and dell 
the latter part of the year marked the start of an abrupt downturn in technology spending by the companies and consumers served by our customers  and our business was affected accordingly 
demand for our services decreased  capacity in our industry became under utilized  competition grew more fierce and prices declined significantly 
these factors have been the primary determinants of our financial results over this time period in which we have generally experienced declining revenues  gross margins and profitability 
the effects of these market changes have not only had an impact on our financial performance  but have defined our challenges and opportunities going forward 
in general  media production capacity in our industry continues to be under utilized  particularly during seasonally slow periods 
until this capacity either becomes more consistently fully utilized through an increase or diversification in demand  or is in some way removed from the market  the ability of zomax or other companies in our industry to maintain or regain pricing power and acceptable levels of profitability  will be limited 
we are privileged to have long standing relationships with large customers who are market leaders in their industries  but these customers demand continuous improvements in service  quality and price from their vendors  and our ability to retain these customers is dependent on our ability to consistently deliver on these demands better and more efficiently than our competitors 
because a large portion of our business is dependent on a relatively few number of these customers  our ability to retain and grow our business with these customers in the face of intense competition is critical to our financial performance into the foreseeable future 
while we recognize the difficult challenges to growing our business and returning it to acceptable levels of profitability  we believe we are well positioned to address such challenges 
our core market supply chain outsourcing services continues to show promising growth as industry leading companies continue to focus on their core competencies and outsource their non critical business functions 
the challenges mentioned above associated with our customer and industry dependencies also provide us opportunities 
we believe our relationships with these customers are strong and that our knowledge of their businesses  our broad range of service capabilities and our financially strong balance sheet are important decision factors for these customers 
we also believe that our efforts over the past two years in broadening our customer base in both traditional and new markets should provide opportunities for growth 
while we believe we have many of the ingredients necessary to return growth and profitability to our business  doing so will require that we continue to increase our investments in the people  processes and technologies that are critical to delivering services to our customers and positioning our business for growth  and that we continue to address and manage the many risks and uncertainties we face in our business 
a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties can be found in the section captioned risk factors at item of the form k

for purposes of our internal understanding of business operations  as well as for planning and forecasting future periods  we exclude from our gaap results those items that meet the definition of non recurring  as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
accordingly  to aid in the understanding of our financial results  our discussion and analysis of results of operations is presented on both a gaap basis as reported  and on the basis of the exclusion of these non recurring items as adjusted 
however  the presentation of as adjusted results is not meant to be a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with gaap

this item is not reflected as an adjustment in the table as it does not meet the definition of a non recurring item as defined by the securities and exchange commission 
revenue general factors affecting revenue 
we derive our revenues from a wide variety of supply chain services provided to our customers 
changes in our revenues from period to period are directly related to changes in the number of cd and dvd media units that we replicate for our customers  changes in pricing  changes in the composition of the products and services we provide  and changes in the mix of customers we serve 
revenues are generally more favorably impacted when our mix of customers is weighted toward those who are using a broad range of our services 
bundled pricing  changes in the content of the products we make for our customers and other factors make it difficult to precisely determine the impact each of these factors has on changes in our total revenue 
vs 
for the first time since fiscal year  our revenue increased on an annual basis  growing  from million in  to million in in  we experienced a increase in media unit volume  accounting for the majority of our increase in revenue 
this volume increase was driven mostly by increases in demand from our current customer base  but also by demand from new customers 
the balance of the revenue increase was a result of a favorable change in our customer mix  partially offset by continued pricing pressures 
the increase in demand in was relatively broad across our major customer base 
microsoft  our largest customer  represented approximately of our revenue in  up from approximately in while our sales to microsoft increased in  the programs we support for microsoft continue to evolve and we anticipate that related support requirements and revenues associated with these programs will continue to decline going forward 
however  we believe we maintain a positive relationship with microsoft and continue to pursue opportunities to provide additional services to this key customer 
in addition to microsoft  sales to dell computer exceeded of our total revenue in  representing a significant increase over the improvement in customer mix in was primarily related to a reduction in sales to a customer which purchased large volumes of lower priced  bulk cds from us in bulk cds represent cds that we replicate and sell without providing additional services such as packaging or fulfillment 
the price declines were a result of the general industry conditions discussed in the introduction and overview above 
vs 
total revenues in declined despite an increase of approximately in the number of media units sold 
the volume increase was more than offset by changes in our customer mix and pricing declines 
in  our customer mix was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the number of lower priced  bulk cds sold to one major customer  and a significant decrease in our sales to microsoft  our largest customer 
sales to microsoft  which consist of replication  fulfillment and call center services in support of certain microsoft programs  decreased from of revenue in  to in this decrease was attributable to the composition and pricing of the microsoft programs we support  resulting in a decrease in the cost to microsoft of providing those services 
gross profit general factors affecting gross profit 
our gross profit percentage during a period is dependent on a number of factors 
the pricing declines discussed under revenue above have been the primary contributor to the gross profit erosion we experienced from to in addition to changes in pricing  the volume of business we experience in a given period also impacts our margins 
a large portion of the costs required to deliver our products and services are fixed in nature 
increases in volume allow us to leverage these costs resulting in higher gross profit margins  while decreases in volume have the opposite effect 
our relative mix of customers  as well as the related content of products or services we provide them  can also have a significant impact on gross profit margins 
for example  the relative mix of cd dvd media  labor and print material in the products we produce for our customers can affect our overall gross profit percentage 
although gross profit measured as a percentage of revenue may be lower  we believe providing incremental value added services to our customers has an overall positive effect on gross margin as measured in dollars 
additionally  our ability to utilize automated packaging equipment versus manual labor can have a favorable effect on gross profit 
vs 
on an as reported basis  our gross profit percentage improved from in  to in this increase reflects a million benefit related to the signing of a revised royalty agreement as discussed in footnote to table a above 
however  had the reduced royalty rates been in effect since  as reflected in table a above  our gross profit percentage would have declined from in to in this decrease is primarily attributable to the effect of declining unit prices  partially offset by an increase in unit volumes as discussed under revenue above  particularly in the fourth quarter 
this increase in unit volume resulted in improved leverage of our fixed costs and had a favorable effect of approximately on our gross profit margin percentage 
vs 
on an as reported basis  our gross profit percentage decreased  from in  to in however  had the reduced royalty rates been in effect since  as reflected in table a above  our gross profit percentage would have decreased only  from in to in this decrease reflected continued unit price deterioration of cd and dvd media  a decline in total revenue relative to our fixed costs and the shift in our product mix to products that contain a higher content of lower margin packaging materials 
while unit volumes increased from to  this increase provided only minimal fixed cost leverage as the volume increase was attributable to sales of low priced  bulk cds to a single customer 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses general factors affecting sg a expenses 
a substantial portion of our sg a expenses are fixed in nature 
however  certain components such as incentive compensation  professional services  travel and other expenses can vary based on business results  individual events  or initiatives we may be pursuing at various times throughout the year 
in addition to these factors  some of our sg a expenses are incurred in countries outside the us and changes in foreign currency rates can cause our sg a expenses reported in us dollars to fluctuate 
vs 
on an as reported basis  our sg a expenses increased million  or 
on an as adjusted basis  which excludes the effect of a charge related to the settlement of a customer claim and a severance charge related to the resignation of our ceo as described in table a above  sg a expenses increased million  or 
sg a expenses in included approximately million of costs associated with potential acquisition opportunities pursued earlier in that year  and a million write down of customer contact center software systems as a result of the replacement of those systems beginning late in excluding these expenses from  sg a expenses increased million  or from to a significant portion of this increase is related to investments we started making in the latter part of  in capabilities aimed at increasing the number of customers and markets we serve  the suite of services we offer  including electronic software downloading  our capabilities to support new and existing markets and services  and new locations in the us and mexico 
in addition to the effects of these investments on our sg a expenses  approximately million of the increase is attributable to the translation effect of currency exchange rate changes on expenses incurred in our ireland and canadian operations 
increases in employee medical and general business insurance costs and incentive compensation also contributed to the increase in sg a expense in vs 
on an as reported basis  sg a expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is the result of approximately million in legal and other costs associated with potential acquisition opportunities pursued in the first half of and a million write down of the company s existing call center software systems as a result of the replacement of those systems that began in the fourth quarter of income taxes vs 
on an as reported basis  our income tax benefit in represents of our pretax loss  compared to of our pretax loss in our income tax benefit in includes a million benefit related to a reduction in our tax accruals following the completion of a canadian tax audit see income taxes under application of critical accounting policies below 
excluding this benefit  our effective tax rate would have been  reflecting the favorable tax position of having current year operating profits in our ireland operations  which are subject to relatively low tax rates  and current year operating losses in our us operations  which are subject to relatively higher tax rates 
had our consolidated operating losses been spread evenly across all tax jurisdictions in which we operate  our effective tax rate  excluding the million benefit previously discussed  would have been more comparable to vs 
on an as reported basis  the effective income tax rate for was compared to in due to the decline in earnings before income taxes  income and deductions that are permanently treated differently for book and tax purposes had a larger relative effect in than in when measured as a percentage of the lower pretax results 
application of critical accounting policies revenue recognition we record revenue at the time product is shipped or as services are rendered 
for certain customers  product is invoiced upon completion  with shipment occurring based on written customer instructions 
in these cases  the customer accepts title to the goods as of the date of the invoice and sales revenue is recognized at that time 
in each case of these bill and hold sales  we ensure that the transaction complies with the conditions and considerations contained in accounting and auditing enforcement release no 
of the securities and exchange commission 
royalties 
we have license agreements with several companies for the use of certain cd and dvd manufacturing technology we use in our business 
we do not necessarily have agreements with every patent holder that may assert or has asserted a claim to royalties 
the cost of these royalties is accrued based on units sold and charged to cost of revenue 
our royalty costs are based upon the terms of our royalty agreements as well as our assessment of the applicability of any other known or potential royalties 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed negotiations with one of the major patent holders resulting in the signing of a revised royalty agreement that retroactively reduced the royalties payable to this patent holder 
these negotiations  which had been previously disclosed in our form k  began in while we were hopeful from the start of our negotiations that we would achieve a retroactive application of the reduced royalty rates  this was not guaranteed and  in our judgment  it was not appropriate to recognize the benefit of the potentially reduced rates until the completion of a final agreement 
upon signing the new agreement in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a benefit to cost of revenue totaling million related to these reduced rates as well as smaller adjustments to the rates at which we accrue other known or potential royalties 
this total benefit reflected a reduction of unpaid royalties of million accrued in the first three quarters of and million accrued in income taxes 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return and separate state and foreign returns 
deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes  based on the expected income tax rates for the year in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse 
foreign net operating loss carryforwards may be carried forward indefinitely 
the preparation of our income tax returns requires the interpretation of the associated tax laws 
many tax laws are complex  and at times ambiguous  and our interpretations of these laws may differ from the interpretations of the taxing authorities who have the right to audit our returns within statutory time periods 
where we believe there is a quantifiable risk that our interpretations of these laws could reasonably differ from those of the taxing authorities  we make appropriate provisions in our tax liabilities 
in  canadian tax authorities completed an audit of our canadian tax returns for the years  and accordingly  we removed million of provisions we had made in our tax liabilities related to the risk that tax authorities would reject certain positions we had taken in the preparation of these returns 
accounts receivable 
we review our accounts receivable balances on a regular basis to determine their collectability 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded based on management s estimate of those accounts which may become uncollectible 
inventory 
we review our inventory on a regular basis with the objective of assessing its net realizable value 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory according to our estimates of the net realizable value of individual inventory components relative to their purchase or carrying value

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents 
at the end of  cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million from despite our net loss in  we generated million of cash from operations 
this represents a decrease of million from the million generated in this decrease is primarily due to increases in working capital requirements in the fourth quarter of resulting from the strong increase in revenues during that quarter 
cash used in investing activities in was million  net of the return of a million escrow deposit related to the ilogistix acquisition that was subsequently terminated 
see item of this form k 
capital expenditures in totaled million  an increase of million from  and consisted primarily of upgrades to our customer contact center systems and an increase in dvd replication capacity 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  an increase from the million of cash used by these activities in in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a stock buy back program to expend up to million to repurchase zomax common stock in the open market 
we repurchased  shares in for a total cost of million  bringing our total repurchases under this program to  shares for a total cost of million 
the timing and extent of future repurchases will vary based on market conditions as well as regulatory limitations imposed on such programs 
in  we also retired all of our long term debt obligations for a total of million 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a million positive impact on reported cash balances in due to the increase during the year in the value of the euro and canadian dollar  the functional currencies of our ireland and canadian operations  relative to the us dollar 
working capital and liquidity 
working capital totaled million and million at the end of and  respectively 
our primary source of working capital continues to be cash and cash equivalent balances as described above 
in addition to our working capital balances  we also have available for sale securities which had a value at the end of of million  up from million at the end of  representing our investment in intraware see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of the end of  these securities were fully registered 
at the end of  we had no outstanding debt 
at the end of and  our total outstanding debt was million and million  respectively 
in we cancelled our revolving line of credit facility which had available borrowings up to million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility during  or our future liquidity needs will depend on  among other factors  the timing of capital expenditures  expenditures in connection with possible acquisitions  changes in customer order volume and the timing and collection of receivables 
we believe that existing cash and investment balances and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations payments due under known contractual obligations as of the end of are as follows in millions less than year to years to years after years total operating lease obligations strategic alliance agreement total as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have entered into a strategic alliance agreement with intraware  a provider of electronic software download services 
this agreement has a ten year term that may be cancelled earlier at our option upon days notice 
we also incur other contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business related primarily to the purchase of goods and services such as inventory  supplies and capital equipment 
these obligations are generally cancelable up until the time we receive the related goods or services 
market risk foreign currency 
a portion of our operations are located in ireland and canada 
a majority of the revenue from our canadian operations  and a portion of the related costs  are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we have limited exposure to the canadian currency 
the majority of revenues and related costs in our ireland operations are denominated in euros 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are reflected in our financial statements and historically have not been material to our results of operations or financial condition 
however  we anticipate we will continue to incur exchange gains and losses from foreign operations in the future which may be significant depending on factors such as changes in foreign currency or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in addition  sales of our products and services may be directly impacted by the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
inflation historically  inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
the cost of labor and raw material  particularly the cost of petroleum  which affects the cost of polycarbonate used in the manufacture of optical discs  can influence the cost of our products and services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on any increased material or labor costs to our customers in the future
