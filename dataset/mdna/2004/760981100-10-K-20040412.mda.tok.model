our plan is to fill the void in the marketplace above the current home lifestyle retailers  and below the interior design trade  by providing products centered around our core businesses that reflect a predictable  high quality promise to our customers 
we operate on a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to january st 
our current fiscal year ended on january  fiscal  the prior fiscal year ended on february  fiscal and fiscal ended on february  fiscal 
fiscal  and each consisted of weeks 
as of january   we operated stores in states  the district of columbia and canada 
in addition to our retail stores  we operate a direct to customer sales channel that includes both catalog and internet  and a wholly owned furniture manufacturer 
in fiscal  we determined that we needed to implement a repositioning strategy to expand and clarify our core businesses  adjust down our proportion of lower margin furniture sales while increasing our higher margin textiles category  increase our direct imports  grow our direct to customer business and close underperforming stores 
we were successful in meeting our goals for fiscal  and during fiscal we continued to make progress in each of these categories 
during fiscal  we introduced bath fixtures and faucets and a customizable sofa offering  increased direct imports to of our purchases versus in fiscal and in fiscal  grew our direct to customer business over fiscal  reduced furniture as a percentage of net revenue  and closed four under performing stores 
we have begun a core business excellence approach to merchandising our business 
in particular  in march  we have increased the number of vice presidents in merchandising from two to four individuals  each of whom is in charge of separate core merchandise offerings  such as furniture or textiles and added complementary support in product development  design and sourcing 
to oversee this new organization  we have placed a new senior vice president  who previously ran our direct to customer division  in charge of our entire merchandising process 
our business is highly seasonal  which reflects a general pattern in the retail industry wherein the highest sales and earnings occur during the holiday season 
historically  a significant portion of our sales are in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in our peak holiday selling season  we incur significant additional expenses in connection with  among other things  the hiring of additional seasonal employees in our retail stores and the production and mailing of our catalogs 
in fiscal  our holiday sales results were disappointing 
we attribute this to two principal facts 
first  during fiscal  we focused more on the expansion of our core merchandise offerings and  as a consequence  we underdeveloped accessories 
we believe the accessories category tends to be compatible with gift items that should perform well during the holiday season 
second  during fiscal  management devoted significant amounts of time on operational and other administrative aspects of the business  including executing a significant reorganization in our accounting and finance departments 
having addressed many of these and other issues in fiscal  we are focusing more of our efforts in the fiscal year ending january  fiscal on the development of holiday offerings as well as the continued growth of our core merchandise offerings 
in the latter half of fiscal  we faced issues with our in stock availability and furniture delivery through our distribution network due to management difficulties in our baltimore distribution facility as well as problems with the implementation of a new order management system 
we expect that during the first half of fiscal we may continue to have some distribution delays in the eastern part of the united states  which may constrain our results during this period 
we have actively worked to address these issues  including putting in place a new management team in our baltimore distribution facility 
we also opened two new stores  one that is located in cleveland  ohio and one that is located in richmond  virginia  and we closed four under performing stores during fiscal we opened the two new stores based on our new prototype  which is designed to showcase our existing and new core businesses with greater clarity and authority 
a third prototype store was re opened in november  replacing our previously existing store in corte madera  california  which was temporarily closed for expansion 
for the upcoming fiscal year  we are also considering the expansion of one existing store and the opening of one to two additional new stores 
in march  we closed one under performing store and we are evaluating one to two additional under performing stores for potential closure 
a material decline in sales and other adverse conditions resulting from our failure to accurately anticipate changes in merchandise trends and consumer demands may cause us to close additional under performing stores 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the amount and percentage of net revenue represented by certain line items in our consolidated statement of operations 
dollars in thousands  except per share data fiscal of net revenue fiscal of net revenue fiscal of net revenue retail revenue    direct to customer    net revenue    cost of revenue and occupancy   gross profit    selling  general and administrative expenses   loss from operations interest expense  net and other loss before income taxes   income tax benefit    net loss preferred shareholder return dividends  beneficial conversion charges  loss attributable to common stockholders   loss per common share basic and diluted furniture manufacturing revenue of thousand  thousand and thousand for fiscal  and  respectively  has been allocated to retail revenue for purposes of the following discussion 
loss from operations improved to million in fiscal as compared to loss from operations of million in fiscal loss attributable to common stockholders was per share  or million  for fiscal  compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of per share  or million  for fiscal fiscal year included a one time tax benefit of million  or per share  related to the economic stimulus bill enacted on march  the million improvement in the loss from operations in fiscal over the prior fiscal year is primarily driven by a million  or  increase in net revenue  which largely resulted from a increase in comparable store sales  as well as the continued growth of our direct to customer business  which increased million  or  over fiscal the increase in comparable store sales over fiscal is driven by our continued focus on building brand authority in our core merchandise offerings 
the increase in net revenue in both our retail and direct channels can also be attributed to our focus on growing both our catalog circulation and page count per catalog  as the catalog is our primary advertising vehicle 
the increase in net revenue drove higher gross margins as we leveraged fixed infrastructure costs 
results were also affected by an increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily attributable to higher payroll  catalog production costs and credit card fees  these increases were incurred in support of our revenue growth 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses  expressed as a percentage of revenue  declined basis points in fiscal versus fiscal from leverage on higher sales 
going forward  we plan to continue fostering brand awareness through annual  product focused sales events  such as our famous fall lighting sale and our annual bath event 
loss from operations improved to million in fiscal as compared to loss from operations of million in fiscal during fiscal  we incurred special item charges of million  or per share  related to our inventory lower of cost or market reserve  depreciation  asset impairment charges and valuation allowance 
loss attributable to common stockholders was per share  or million for fiscal  compared to a loss attributable to common stockholders of per share or million for fiscal fiscal results included a one time tax benefit of million  or per share 
our smaller loss from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven by a million increase in net revenue  million of which related to an increase in net revenue from our retail stores and an million increase in net revenue from our direct to customer channel 
these increases resulted from the implementation of our repositioning strategy in fiscal  including the introduction of new product lines  in particular our premium positioned textiles  the re modeling our stores  and increases in advertising and events associated with the re launch of our remodeled stores 
revenue retail revenue fiscal year dollars in thousands net retail revenue    net retail revenue growth percentage comparable store sales growth total transactions growth decline percentage average revenue per transaction growth percentage number of stores at beginning of year number of stores opened number of stores closed number of stores at year end store selling square feet at year end    net retail revenue for fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal primarily due to an million  or  increase in comparable store sales 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal was driven primarily by strong performance in our core merchandise offerings 
this increase was partially offset by decreased sales related to the closure of four under performing stores during the second and third quarters of fiscal  the temporary closure of one additional store which was closed for expansion during the third quarter of fiscal  and a slight decrease in furniture sales 
net revenue from these closed stores was million during fiscal and these stores contributed million in net revenue for the portion of fiscal that they were open 
net retail revenue increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million  or  increase in comparable store sales 
in addition to revenue growth from comparable store sales  one new store and a warehouse sale event in fiscal accounted for increased net retail revenue  offset by a decrease in net retail revenue as a result of fiscal store closures 
the comparable store sales increase resulted from the implementation of our repositioning strategy as described above  in particular  the introduction of our premium positioned textiles 
average revenue per retail transaction increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and the total number of retail transactions by customers was consistent with the prior year 
the increase in average revenue per retail transaction in fiscal was primarily due to a change in our product mix to include more textiles and fewer lower priced products  such as accessories 
average revenue per retail transaction in fiscal increased compared to fiscal  while the total number of retail transactions decreased by 
we attribute both the changes in the number of retail transactions and average revenue per transaction from fiscal through fiscal to the new product introductions and product mix changes implemented as the integral part of our repositioning strategy 
average revenue per transaction is calculated by dividing the amount of gross sales  exclusive of delivery revenue and sales taxes  by the gross number of transactions 
comparable store sales are defined as sales from stores whose gross square footage did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open at least full months 
stores generally become comparable in their th full month of operation 
we believe that comparable store sales are a more useful indicator of store performance than the change in total net revenue  since comparable store sales exclude the effects of changes in the number of stores open 
we periodically hold warehouse sales to sell our damaged items  seconds and sample inventory items 
the revenue related to these sales is included in our retail revenue  but it is excluded from our comparable store sales 
net revenue was million and million related to our warehouse sales in fiscal and  respectively 
there were no warehouse sales held during fiscal direct to customer revenue fiscal year dollars in thousands catalog revenue    internet revenue    total net direct to customer revenue    percentage growth in net direct to customer revenue percentage growth in number of catalogs mailed total transactions growth percentage average revenue per transaction growth percentage net direct to customer revenue consists of both catalog and internet sales 
net direct to customer revenue during fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal a portion of this increase was the result of a increase in the number of catalogs mailed in fiscal  to million from million in fiscal average revenue per direct to customer transaction in fiscal increased from fiscal we believe this increase related to a change in our product mix in the catalog and an increase in catalog only furniture offerings 
total direct to customer transactions in fiscal increased from fiscal we believe this increase in direct to customer transactions is due in part to our initiative to increase page count in our catalog and increase the number of new images in each catalog we send out 
additionally  we believe our website marketing efforts coupled with growing consumer familiarity with the internet and growth in high speed internet consumers also helped drive customers to our website 
shipping income related to and included in our direct to customer revenue above was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net direct to customer revenue in fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal this was a result of a increase in the number of catalogs mailed in fiscal  to million from million in fiscal we also believe that the new textile product introduction  as well as the redesign of our catalog and website  contributed to the revenue increase 
average revenue per direct to customer transaction in fiscal increased from fiscal  and total direct to customer transactions increased from fiscal we believe the increase in average revenue per transaction is a result of our new product introductions and changed product mix 
furniture manufacturing we have a wholly owned furniture manufacturing company located in sacramento  california  the michaels furniture company  inc michaels 
virtually all of the furniture produced at michaels is sold through our retail or direct to customer revenue channels  and such sales have been recognized in the revenue channel from which the sale originated 
we have eliminated sales by michaels to third parties  in order to increase production capacity for our retail and direct channel customers 
expenses cost of revenue and occupancy expense in fiscal  cost of revenue and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to  from in fiscal approximately basis points of improvement was achieved due to the leveraging of relatively fixed store occupancy costs and was partially offset by approximately basis points related to distribution costs 
in fiscal  cost of revenue and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to  from in fiscal approximately basis points of this improvement was related to inventory charges taken in fiscal as a result of our product repositioning strategy 
another basis points of the improvement was due to higher product margin in fiscal compared to fiscal  driven primarily by higher initial markups on our merchandise purchases 
this increase was due to the addition to our product mix of merchandise with higher gross margins  particularly our new textile categories and better product sourcing 
the last basis points of the improvement was due to the leveraging of buying and distribution and occupancy costs by increased revenue in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to in fiscal  from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense expressed in absolute dollars increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars primarily related to an increase in payroll expense and to a lesser degree  an increase in catalog production costs and credit card fees 
the improvement in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the leveraging of store payroll costs approximately basis points  which declined as a percentage of net revenue  cost savings initiatives for supplies approximately basis points  partially offset by increases in advertising costs as well as increased credit card fees related to the conclusion in fiscal of our incentive program in connection with our private label credit card approximately basis points in total 
advertising expense primarily represents costs associated with catalog production and mailing 
we expect that as the direct to customer channel revenue grows at a faster rate than retail revenue  the costs of this advertising will necessarily have the effect of de leveraging selling  general and administrative expenses  as occurred in fiscal in contrast  the cost of retail occupancy will decline as a percentage of net revenue  which benefit will be reflected in improved gross margins 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expense in absolute dollars were incurred largely to support our increase in net revenue 
expense has been incurred  and will continue to be incurred  with respect to the implementation of the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  in particular  with respect to section requiring management to report on  and the independent auditors to attest to  internal controls 
selling  general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue increased approximately basis points to in fiscal  from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense expressed in absolute dollars increased million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense expressed as a percent of net revenue was primarily due to increased advertising costs approximately basis points  increased personnel costs due to staffing upgrades and personnel additions implemented in connection with our repositioning strategy approximately basis points  and increased professional fees approximately basis points 
the increase in absolute dollars primarily related to increases in advertising costs  payroll and professional fees  and to a lesser degree  store related expenses incurred to support our increases in revenue 
interest expense  net and other for fiscal  interest expense  net and other includes interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and amortization of debt issuance costs 
in fiscal  interest expense  net and other was million  a decrease of million as compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower average borrowing rates and lower average borrowings outstanding  and the repayment of a stockholder note by our president and chief executive officer  gary g 
friedman  during the third quarter of fiscal we ended with a million lower gross debt balance than at the end of fiscal in fiscal  interest expense  net and other was million as compared to million in fiscal excluding the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest expense related to warrants  interest expense decreased by million 
the decrease resulted from amendments to our revolving credit facility to provide for more favorable interest rates 
average borrowings in fiscal were only slightly higher than the average debt level in fiscal in addition  we originally issued warrants in connection with a september amendment of our revolving credit facility 
such warrants have been exercised into common stock over time and all warrants had been exercised by the end of the first quarter of fiscal during the period the warrants were outstanding in fiscal and  million and million  respectively  were recorded as a result of the change in their fair value 
income tax benefit our effective tax benefit rate was in fiscal  as compared to a tax benefit rate of in fiscal and a tax benefit rate of in fiscal the fiscal rate reflects a million benefit realized due to the economic stimulus bill enacted in that year  which resulted in a reduction of the valuation allowance recorded in fiscal this reduction in the valuation allowance had the effect of increasing our fiscal tax benefit rate by percentage points 
as of january   we have deferred tax assets totaling million  net of a million valuation allowance  which primarily represent the income tax benefit associated with losses reported in prior years 
these losses are subject to federal and state carryforward provisions of up to years 
we have performed an analysis of the deferred tax assets for realization  including an evaluation of applicable available evidence  both positive and negative 
this included a careful analysis of results of operations for fiscal year and prior years  as well as current operating trends and financial projections for future years 
as of january   we have concluded that the net deferred tax asset balance of million is more likely than not to be recovered 
if we are not able to achieve positive operating results in the future  a valuation allowance for some or all of the million deferred tax asset would need to be recorded against future operations 
the fiscal income tax benefit was reduced by a million valuation allowance provision which adjusted deferred tax assets to an amount that management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
under the applicable accounting literature  we were not allowed to consider the potential effects of a tax law change when we established the valuation allowance at february  as a result  even though the economic stimulus bill was approved prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we were not allowed to reflect the potential positive effects on the overall valuation allowance until the year of the law change  which occurred in the first quarter of fiscal the increase in the valuation allowance in fiscal had the effect of decreasing our tax benefit by percentage points 
preferred shareholder dividends dividend charges of million and million were recognized during fiscal and  respectively  associated with our outstanding series a preferred stock 
subsequently  pursuant to an august  letter agreement  holders of our series a preferred stock agreed to waive their dividend participation right in the event we were to declare a dividend on our common stock 
in the same agreement  we agreed that we would not declare any dividends payable to our common stock holders until we first obtain the approval of at least seventy percent of the then outstanding shares of series a preferred stock 
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and we have no obligation to do so 
as a result of the letter agreement  beginning with the second quarter of fiscal  we no longer record dividend charges related to our outstanding series a preferred stock 
fiscal special items fiscal included special item charges of approximately million 
a discussion of these charges follows 
inventory lower of cost or market reserve in connection with the elimination of approximately of the items from our merchandise assortment during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million to write down discontinued merchandise to its estimated net realizable value 
depreciation at the beginning of the fourth quarter  concurrent with our november private placement of common stock  we finalized our decision to remodel our stores in the first quarter of fiscal as a result  we recorded an increase in depreciation charges of million in fiscal in order to reflect the shortened useful lives of store fixtures and leasehold assets  which were scheduled to be replaced 
asset impairment charge in the course of performing our periodic cash flow analysis of our mature stores  we determined that an asset impairment charge of million was required for eight underperforming locations 
the impairment charge was calculated as the difference between the net book value of the store s long lived assets and the present value of the store s estimated future cash flows over the remaining life of the lease 
tax valuation allowance in the course of analyzing our projected taxable income  we determined that a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets was appropriate as of february  the valuation allowance reduced our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
liquidity and capital resources operating cash flows in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of net cash used by operating activities in fiscal the change in net cash provided used by operating activities resulted primarily from significantly lower merchandise inventory purchases  our improved operating results  and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the impact of these items was partially offset by a decrease in deferred lease incentives and other long term liabilities 
merchandise inventory purchase activity was significantly higher in fiscal as part of the launch of our merchandise repositioning strategy 
in fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was million compared to million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal cash was used by operating activities in fiscal to fund increased merchandise inventories from the unusually depressed inventory levels at the end of fiscal  as we exited old products in preparation for the receipt of new goods for the launch of our merchandise repositioning 
the cash used for inventory investment in fiscal was partially offset by our smaller operating loss  driven by increased sales and improved merchandise margins  the receipt of million in connection with the economic stimulus bill enacted in  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing cash flows net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million of cash used by investing activities in fiscal the million of cash used for investing activities in fiscal primarily related to capital expenditures associated with the opening of two new stores  as well as the remodeling of one additional store in fiscal  all three of which were designed under our new store prototype that was introduced in fiscal net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to million of cash provided by investing activities in fiscal in fiscal  cash was used primarily for the re modeling of substantially all of our stores approximately million  in addition to smaller investments to open one new store  re engineer our website  and implement productivity enhancements in our distribution centers and the michaels furniture operation 
financing cash flows net cash used by financing activities was million in fiscal  and net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal substantially all of the change in net cash provided used by financing activities resulted from net repayments of million in fiscal  as compared to net borrowings of million in fiscal  under our revolving credit facility 
we were able to pay down our line of credit in fiscal due to our lower net loss and additional cash generated from sales 
in addition  we received million during the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the settlement of a claim  and million from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal in fiscal  the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily from our revolving credit facility  in addition to the repayment of a million loan by gary g 
friedman  our president and chief executive officer 
we also received million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on september   we amended our revolving credit facility  which provides for an overall commitment of million  to  among other things  increase the amount available for letters of credit from million to million  and extend the revolving credit facility two years  from june to june in november and march we amended our revolving credit facility further to make minor revisions and clarifications to certain definitions used in the revolving credit facility 
as of january   we had million outstanding under the line of credit  net of unamortized debt issuance costs of million  and million in outstanding letters of credit 
borrowings made under the revolving credit facility are subject to interest at either the bank s reference rate or libor plus a margin 
as of january   the bank s reference rate was and the libor plus margin rate was 
the availability of credit at any given time under the revolving credit facility is limited by reference to a borrowing base formula based upon numerous factors  including the value of eligible inventory and accounts receivable  and is structured to increase to meet seasonal needs 
as a result of the borrow base formula  the actual borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility could be less than the stated amount of the facility reduced by the actual borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
based on our fiscal year end eligible inventory and accounts receivable levels  which are typically lower following the holiday season  and applying the borrowing base formula  we had actual remaining availability under the revolving credit facility of million as of january  the revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including limitations on our annual capital expenditures  store openings  ability to incur additional debt  acquisition of other businesses and payment of dividends and other distributions 
the revolving credit facility does not contain any other significant financial or coverage ratio covenants 
our revolving credit facility requires a lockbox arrangement  which provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
this arrangement  combined with the existence of a subjective acceleration clause in the revolving credit facility  necessitates the revolving credit facility be technically reclassified a current liability on our balance sheet  pursuant to guidance in the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
however  we do not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
the acceleration clause  which is a typical requirement in commercial credit agreements such as ours  allows our lenders to forego additional advances should they determine there has been a material adverse effect in our operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects or a material adverse change in our financial position or prospects reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on our business  condition financial or otherwise  operations  performance or properties 
however  the revolving credit facility does not expire or have a maturity date within one year  but rather has a final expiration date in june additionally  our lenders have not notified us of any indication that a material adverse effect exists at january  or that a material adverse change has occurred 
we believe that no material adverse change has occurred and we believe that we will continue to borrow on the line of credit to fund our operations over the term of the revolving credit facility 
we do not anticipate any changes in our business practices that would result in any determination that there has been a material adverse effect in our operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects 
however  we cannot be certain that our lenders will not make such a determination in the future 
we currently believe that our cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility will satisfy our expected working capital and capital requirements  including our contractual commitments described below  for at least the next months 
however  the weakening of  or other adverse developments concerning our sales performance or adverse developments concerning the availability of credit under our revolving credit facility due to covenant limitations or other factors could limit the overall availability of funds to us 
moreover  we may not have successfully anticipated our future capital needs and we may need to raise additional funds in order to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we also may need to raise additional funds to respond to changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures 
however  should the need arise  additional sources of financing may not be available or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds  we may be required to delay or abandon some of our planned future expenditures or aspects of our current operations 
for more information  please see the section factors that may affect our future operating results  above  in particular the sections we are dependent on external funding sources which may not make available to us sufficient funds when we need them  and because our business requires a substantial level of liquidity  we are dependent upon a revolving credit facility with numerous restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of january  including lease renewals and substitute leases entered into after year end

we do not expect to be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
excluded from the table are contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business such as contracts for professional services or maintenance contracts 
such contracts are cancelable and contain no penalty fees 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  inventories  goodwill  income tax benefits  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other facts and assumptions  including current and expected economic conditions and product mix  that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue revenue is recognized at the time of customer receipt 
this can occur when an item is purchased in the store  or when the item is delivered to the customer 
we record the sale as revenue in the channel where the transaction originated 
shipping and handling we record shipping and handling fees as revenue in the revenue channel that originated the sales transaction 
costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of revenue and occupancy 
returns we provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical return rates 
merchandise inventory our retail inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
manufacturing inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined at standard costs  approximating average costs 
costs include certain buying and distribution costs  including payroll and other costs related to the purchase of inventory 
we write down inventories whenever markdowns reduce the selling price below cost 
additionally  we provide for reserves on inventory based upon our estimate of shrinkage losses 
we also write down our slow moving and discontinued inventory to its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
prepaid catalog expenses prepaid catalog expenses consist of the cost to prepare  print and distribute catalogs 
such costs are amortized over the expected revenue generated from each catalog based on historical experience 
typically the cost of a catalog is amortized over approximately four months 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  typically ranging from three to ten years for all property and equipment except for leasehold improvements and lease acquisition costs 
the cost of leasehold improvements and lease acquisitions is amortized over the useful life of the asset or applicable lease term  whichever is less 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
we review goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
if the carrying values of such assets exceed their estimated fair values  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values 
we generally evaluate long lived tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives at an individual store level  which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified 
we evaluate corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific at a consolidated entity or reporting unit level  as appropriate 
since there is typically no active market for our long lived tangible and intangible assets  we estimate fair values based on the expected future cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows based on store level historical results  current trends and operating and cash flow projections 
our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside our control  including general economic conditions  the competitive environment and regulatory changes 
if actual results differ from our estimates of future cash flows  we may record significant additional impairment charges in the future 
store closure reserves prior to january   we recorded the estimated costs associated with closing a store during the period in which the store was identified and approved by management under a plan of termination  which included the method of disposition and the expected date of completion 
these costs include direct costs to terminate a lease  lease rental payments net of expected sublease income  and the difference between the carrying values and estimated recoverable values of long lived tangible and intangible assets 
we recorded severance and other employee related costs in the period in which we communicated the closure and related severance packages to the affected employees 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires that for exit or disposal activities  initiated after december   we recognize a liability for costs associated with closing a store when the liability is incurred 
we record the present value of expected future lease costs and other closure costs when the store is closed 
we record severance and other employee related costs in the period in which we communicate the closure and related severance packages to the affected employees 
while we do not currently have any reserves established for store closures  we periodically make judgments about which stores we should close and which stores we should continue to operate 
all stores are subject to regular monitoring of their financial performance and cash flows  and many stores are subject to kick out clauses which allow us to terminate the store lease if certain contractually specified sales levels are not achieved 
if we decide to close a number of these stores  we may incur significant store closure costs for which we have not currently reserved 
our calculation of store closure costs includes significant estimates about the amounts and timing of potential lease termination costs and future sublease income 
these estimates are based on our historical experience  the condition and location of the property  the lease terms and current real estate leasing market conditions 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may significantly adjust our store closure reserves in future periods 
self insurance we obtain insurance coverage for significant exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law 
it is generally our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability  property losses  business interruption and employee health care 
we record provisions for these items based on an actuary report  claims experience  regulatory changes  an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported and other relevant factors 
the projections involved in this process are subject to substantial uncertainty because of several unpredictable factors  including actual future claims experience  regulatory changes  litigation trends and changes in inflation 
our self insurance exposure is concentrated in california  where many of our operations are located 
california has experienced significant increases in workers compensation costs as a result of legislative changes and rising medical costs 
while the number of claims and days outstanding our claims remain open have been declining for the past three years  if claims are greater than we originally estimate  or if costs increase beyond what we have anticipated  our recorded reserves may not be sufficient  and we may record additional expense 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  we generally take into account all expected future events then known to us  other than changes in the tax law or rates  which are not permitted to be considered 
accordingly  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the amount of valuation allowance is based upon management s best estimate of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
while future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning are considered in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  this allowance is subject to adjustment in the future 
specifically  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of january   we have deferred tax assets totaling million  net of a million valuation allowance  which primarily represent the income tax benefit associated with losses reported in prior years 
these losses are subject to federal and state carryforward provisions of up to years 
we have performed an analysis of the deferred tax assets for realization  including an evaluation of applicable available evidence  both positive and negative 
this included a careful analysis of results of operations for fiscal year and prior years  as well as current operating trends and financial projections for future years 
as of january   we have concluded that the net deferred tax asset balance of million is more likely than not to be recovered 
if we are not able to achieve positive operating results in the future  a valuation allowance for some or all of the million deferred tax asset would need to be recorded against future operations 
contingencies and litigation we are involved from time to time in legal proceedings  including litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business 
due to the uncertainties inherent in any legal proceeding  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any proceeding and may incur substantial costs to defend the proceeding  irrespective of the merits 
unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as appropriate  we assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
the amount of loss accrual  if any  is subject to adjustment if and when warranted by new developments or revised strategies 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
we accrue our best estimates of the probable settlement for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimates of our probable liability in these matters may change 
other considerations the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recently issued accounting standards during january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires that if an entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the entity 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  for those arrangements entered into prior to february   the provisions of fin were required to be adopted at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  however  in december  the fasb published a revision to fin hereafter referred to as fin r to clarify some of the provisions of fin  and to exempt certain entities from its requirements 
under the new guidance  there are new effective dates for companies that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
the rules are effective in financial statements for periods ending after march  the adoption of fin r did not have any impact on our operating results or financial position  as we do not have any variable interest entities 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the securities and exchange commission  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors

these forward looking statements and assumptions involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  market performance or achievements to differ materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause such differences include  but are not limited to  changes in economic or business conditions in general  changes in product supply  fluctuations in comparable store sales  limitations resulting from restrictive covenants in our revolving credit facility  failure of our management to anticipate changes in consumer trends  loss of key vendors  changes in the competitive environment in which we operate  changes in our management information needs  changes in management  failure to raise additional funds when required  changes in customer needs and expectations and governmental actions and consequences stemming from the continued wars in iraq and afghanistan or from terrorist activities in or related to the united states

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose more than from the bank s reference rate  our results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
we do enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states which  to date  have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our purchases outside of the united states will be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
