item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
business overview we are a genomics based pharmaceutical development company dedicated to improving the lives of patients by developing novel protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics in the areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases  obesity and diabetes  and central nervous system disorders 
our pipeline of therapeutics is based on internally discovered targets from the human genome that we believe play a role in important mechanisms underlying disease 
we have focused our research efforts on three types of targets targets that encode protein therapeutics  targets amenable to antibody therapeutic development and targets amenable to small molecule therapeutic development 
we use internal resources to develop our protein therapeutics and have established development alliances with abgenix  inc abgenix to support our antibody projects and bayer ag bayer to support small molecule projects 
currently  we have one protein therapeutic in clinical development for cancer support and a preclinical pipeline of over protein  antibody and small molecule projects 
strategy we hope to generate value for our shareholders by focusing our resources on developing genomics based therapeutics to improve the lives of patients 
we are striving to become profitable by commercializing a subset of therapeutics stemming from our development pipeline  and establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and commercialization of other therapeutics from our development pipeline 
drug development approach we have taken a systematic approach to identifying and validating the therapeutic targets we believe to be the most promising from the human genome that are both applicable and amenable to drug development 
by leveraging our technology and informatics foundation  we have identified  genes  both novel and known  with the potential to be targets for therapeutic drug development 
based on disease associations in cellular and animal models  we have qualified of these targets as possibly playing a role in disease 
by evaluating the relative medical need  biology  speed of path to patients  and strength of intellectual property position of each of these targets  we have selected our priority projects for development 
we have over priority projects in animal validation or later stages of development across three therapeutic areas protein therapeutics  antibody therapeutics  and small molecule therapeutics 
protein therapeutics proteins are molecules composed of amino acids found in the human body 
there are many types of proteins  all carrying out a number of different biological functions 
protein therapeutics can treat conditions in which a person is either missing an important protein or would benefit from additional amounts of a given protein 
we are applying our genomics expertise and knowledge of disease to develop protein therapeutics in four disease areas oncology  inflammatory diseases  obesity and diabetes  and central nervous system disorders 
we have identified genes whose protein products may make suitable therapeutics  have disease associations and are potentially protected by our intellectual property position 
we have implemented protocols for the production  purification and testing of our proteins  and have established cell based assays for characterizing the therapeutic potential of these proteins 
using animal models  we currently are evaluating the activity of a number of secreted proteins as potential human therapeutics 
proteins with activity and favorable toxicity profiles are then selected for clinical development 
our first product to enter into clinical trials was cg also known as fgf  a protein therapeutic we discovered  which is being investigated for the treatment of oral mucositis  a side effect of patients undertaking radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment 
human monoclonal antibody therapeutics antibody therapeutics are very powerful and highly specific molecules that mimic the activity of a family of specialized naturally occurring proteins used by the body s immune system to combat many diseases 
in contrast with protein therapeutics  which supply additional protein molecules  antibody therapeutics may be used to neutralize the activity of a protein that may contribute to the onset or progression of a disease 
we are applying our genomics expertise and knowledge of disease to develop antibody therapeutics primarily in oncology and inflammatory diseases 
we have identified genes that make suitable targets for antibody therapeutics  have disease associations and may be protected by intellectual property rights 
we are developing antibody therapeutics with our partner abgenix  a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and manufacturing of human therapeutic monoclonal antibodies 
we believe human monoclonal antibodies are superior to other antibody therapeutics because their close resemblance to naturally occurring antibodies decreases the risk of potentially eliciting an immune response that may neutralize their effect or cause an adverse reaction 
we and abgenix are evaluating many antibody development programs and each plan on advancing the most promising into clinical development 
we anticipate initiating clinical trials of our second product  cr  which is a fully human monoclonal antibody being investigated for the treatment of kidney inflammation 
small molecule therapeutics small molecules are low molecular weight molecules designed to interact with specific proteins known to be involved in a given disease condition 
the biggest advantage of small molecule therapeutics is that in contrast to protein therapeutics and antibody therapeutics  which are primarily administered as injectibles  they can be administered as an orally available pill 
we have applied our genomics expertise and knowledge of disease to identify small molecule therapeutic targets in four disease areas oncology  inflammatory diseases  obesity and diabetes  and central nervous system disorders 
our strategy is to partner our small molecule targets with leading companies whose small molecule expertise complements our discovery capabilities 
our obesity and diabetes disease program is partnered with bayer 
in this alliance  we intend to co develop small molecule therapeutics to treat obesity and type ii adult onset diabetes and will co commercialize resulting products 
our oncology  inflammatory diseases and central nervous system small molecule targets are available for partnering 
disease focus we are focusing our discovery and development efforts on four disease areas that have large growing markets and have large unmet medical needs 
oncology nearly million people throughout the world are diagnosed with cancer each year 
the direct and indirect medical costs to treat cancer total more than billion each year  and in the united states alone  cancer takes the lives of  people on average each day 
most of our protein and antibody therapeutics are being developed to help cancer patients 
our first indication for our clinical product  cg  is for oral mucositis  a side effect experienced by patients undergoing cancer therapy 
in addition  we are developing several preclinical protein and antibody therapeutics as cancer treatments 
inflammatory diseases more than million americans suffer from major inflammatory diseases 
arthritis  various forms of respiratory inflammation and debilitating inflammatory bowel disease are a daily reality in the lives of millions of individuals 
for some sufferers  surgery is an undesirable last resort 
however  surgery cannot restore diseased tissue to their previously healthy state 
by focusing on the underlying causes of diseases  we are making progress in developing therapeutics to treat  and in some cases  restore the damage caused by inflammatory disorders 
cr  which we anticipate to be our first antibody therapeutic to enter clinical trials  has the potential to be a promising alternative to many patients with kidney inflammation that may develop kidney failure and require kidney transplantation 
in addition  we have multiple protein and antibody therapeutics in preclinical development to treat inflammatory conditions 
obesity and diabetes approximately million americans are overweight or obese and million have been diagnosed with diabetes 
in the united states alone  the direct and indirect costs of overweight and obesity is over billion and of diabetes is over billion 
these conditions are reaching epidemic proportions and lead to a tremendous drain on the healthcare system 
our collaboration with bayer for the development of small molecules for the treatment of diabetes and obesity accounts for the majority of our work in this area 
the collaboration on diabetes treatment focuses on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity 
the focus of the collaboration for obesity is on satiety and peripheral metabolism 
in addition to our small molecule collaboration with bayer  we also have protein and antibody therapeutics in our pipeline for obesity 
central nervous system disorders it is estimated that up to billion people throughout the world suffer with some form of central nervous system disorder  such as depression  schizophrenia  alzheimer s disease or parkinson s disease 
alzheimer s disease alone leads to over a billion drain to the us healthcare system 
our scientists have been examining the genetic pathways associated with both psychiatric and neurological disorders and have identified potential targets in this area 
we have promising programs in central nervous system disorders in early stages of development 
leading products cg for oncology support in  we became one of the first genomics companies to discover  validate  and successfully advance a novel therapeutic candidate from the human genome into phase i clinical trials when we received us food and drug administration fda clearance to begin testing cg in patients 
cg  also known as fibroblast growth factor fgf  is a novel investigational protein therapeutic for the treatment of radiation or chemotherapy induced oral mucositis and inflammatory bowel disease 
oral mucositis is a side effect of patients undertaking radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment 
the disease is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the tissue lining the mouth and throat leading to bleeding  pain  and difficulty eating and drinking 
in addition to leading to debilitating symptoms  oral mucositis may result in the interruption of radiation or chemotherapeutic protocols in oncology patients 
currently  there is no fda approved therapy to treat oral mucositis 
a therapeutic that could treat oral mucositis successfully would not only prevent debilitating symptoms  but also would enable cancer patients to receive the optimum dosage of radiation therapy or chemotherapy needed to fight their cancer 
cg promotes proliferation of two critical layers of cells epithelial and mesenchymal present in the mucosa lining the mouth and the remainder of a patient s gastrointestinal tract 
the molecule has demonstrated activity in two animal models of oral mucositis and the data for these studies was published in the journal clinical cancer research in in addition  the molecule is also active in multiple animal models of inflammatory bowel disease and data for these studies was published in the journal gastroenterology in cg is in a phase i trial in patients with oral mucositis 
studies in other clinical indications are planned 
cr for kidney inflammation cr is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody with the potential to treat a potentially common form of kidney inflammation 
cr is designed to block the activity of platelet derived growth factor d  or pdgf d  a target shown to play a role in kidney inflammation 
cr is the most advanced fully human monoclonal antibody stemming from our collaboration with abgenix 
the project is currently in preclinical development and we anticipate filing an investigational new drug application ind and initiating clinical trials of cr this molecule will be one of the first therapeutics aimed at treating a root cause of kidney inflammation 
kidney inflammation typically is characterized by a loss of architecture and diminishing function that may eventually lead to kidney failure  necessitating dialysis or kidney transplantation 
kidney inflammation is usually managed clinically by the use of non specific immunosuppressants  which have variable efficacy and debilitating side effects 
a study conducted in an animal model of kidney nephritis  published in the journal of the american society of nephrology in  earned us and our colleagues from abgenix a congress award at the world congress of nephrology meeting 
pipeline we have over potential protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics currently being evaluated in animal studies or being prepared for animal studies 
many of the inds that we anticipate filing in the future will be identified from these programs 
each of these programs has been developed to target a mechanism believed to be causative or supportive of disease such as inflammation  proliferation and angiogenesis 
the majority of our advanced antibody and protein therapeutics are in the areas of cancer and inflammation  and our small molecules are in the area of obesity and diabetes 
collaborations our technology and expertise have been used in our partnerships with more than a dozen leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies including biogen  inc biogen  genentech  inc 
genentech  glaxosmithkline  inc gsk  hoffmann la roche inc 
roche and pfizer inc 
in addition  we have established a pipeline of potential therapeutics by leveraging the capabilities of industry leaders to more efficiently advance our programs  reduce risk  and conserve resources 
we have developed three classes of therapeutics protein therapeutics which are developed in house  fully human monoclonal antibody therapeutics which are developed in collaboration with abgenix and small molecule therapeutics for diabetes and obesity which are developed through a collaboration with bayer 
abgenix in december  we entered into a strategic alliance with abgenix to develop and commercialize genomic based antibody therapeutics using abgenix xenomouse technology 
this six year alliance was established initially to identify fully human antibody therapeutic candidates primarily in oncology 
antibodies determined to have commercial product potential will be allocated between the parties for further development 
under the terms of the agreement  the developing party will pay milestone and royalty payments to the other party for products resulting from this drug development alliance 
in addition  under the agreement  abgenix purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for million through a private placement 
in november  we expanded our alliance with abgenix to include the potential for generating fully human monoclonal antibodies against a larger number of targets and for treating a broader range of complex diseases including autoimmune disorders 
as part of this expanded alliance  abgenix purchased an additional  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for million through a private placement 
our collaboration with abgenix has been very productive 
fully human monoclonal antibodies have been raised against over targets and many of these programs are being evaluated for advancement into cellular and animal validation 
we anticipate that we will be initiating clinical development in the near future of cr  our leading antibody therapeutic stemming from our collaboration with abgenix and together we have eight additional antibody programs in animal studies 
our abgenix collaboration has enabled us to leverage the resources and expertise of one of the world s leaders in generating fully human monoclonal antibodies and has fueled our pipeline with a total of proprietary fully human monoclonal antibodies whose development we control 
either party can terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of contract by the other party upon days written notice 
in addition  either party may terminate the agreement upon a breach of certain payment or diligence obligations by the other party if such breach continues  in the case of certain payment obligations  for days and  in the case of certain diligence obligations  for days  after written notice of such breach was provided by the non breaching party 
bayer in january  we signed two comprehensive drug discovery  evaluation  development  and co commercialization agreements with bayer 
as part of these agreements  bayer purchased  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in a private placement totaling million 
the first agreement is a comprehensive alliance to discover  develop  and jointly commercialize small molecule therapeutics to treat metabolic disorders  primarily obesity and adult onset diabetes 
we are to provide therapeutic targets to bayer and grant bayer access to our comprehensive suite of functional genomic technologies  bioinformatics and pharmacogenomic expertise to select and prioritize the resulting therapeutics 
bayer will utilize its development expertise to develop small molecule therapeutics against the targets supplied by us 
bayer is responsible under the agreement for funding all high throughput screening  combinatorial chemistry  medicinal chemistry and pharmacology activities until a designated preclinical stage 
we share expenses with bayer related to later stage preclinical and clinical compound development 
both parties jointly fund the relevant research  development and commercialization activities 
if we jointly commercialize any therapeutics resulting from this alliance with bayer  bayer will receive of the profits associated with that therapeutic and we will receive 
either party can terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach of contract by the other party  upon days written notice day notice for payment breach 
bayer may terminate the agreement if there is a change in control involving us  upon providing days written notice to us within days 
we may terminate the screening term upon a change in control of bayer  upon providing written notice to bayer within days 
the second agreement is a broad  five year pharmacogenomic and toxicogenomic collaboration 
we are applying our functional genomic technologies and pharmacogenomics expertise to evaluate bayer s developmental and preclinical pipeline of pharmaceutical compounds across all disease areas 
through the efforts of this collaboration  we and bayer expect to reduce drug development costs  reduce the time to market  and create safer and more efficacious therapeutics 
either party can terminate upon an uncured material breach of contract by the other party  upon days written notice 
in certain circumstances bayer may terminate the agreement if there is a change in control involving us  upon providing written notice to us within days 
other in addition to the above listed alliances  we have smaller  ongoing collaborative relationships with various pharmaceutical and biotech companies 
we have established relationships with more than universities  academic institutions  and individual companies to gain access to disease tissue samples  disease models  and select technologies 
we have successfully conducted research with  and have the potential to receive future milestones and royalties from companies including alexion pharmaceuticals  inc  biogen  dupont pioneer hi bred international  inc  gsk  genentech  roche and its affiliate  roche vitamins  inc and millennium pharmaceuticals  inc formerly cor therapeutics  inc at present  we do not consider these relationships either collectively or individually to be of a material nature 
company history we began operations in  when the massive undertaking to sequence the human genome was just beginning 
our strategy was based on discovering novel ways to combat disease through an understanding of how genes and their resulting proteins function within the human genome 
we developed an integrated genomics  proteomics and bioinformatics technology platform that has been used to analyze the human genome  disease models  marketed therapeutics and therapeutic candidates 
this approach has led to our discovery of hundreds of disease related genes  therapeutic targets and potential novel therapeutics 
our platform has been utilized by over a dozen biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
these collaborations helped validate our technology and have assisted us in developing our own proprietary pipeline of potential therapeutics 
we have focused our research efforts on three types of targets targets that encode protein therapeutics  targets amenable to antibody therapeutic development  and targets amenable to small molecule therapeutic development 
as our portfolio has grown  we have started developing protein therapeutics on our own  and transitioned our service based collaborations towards more strategic research and development alliances that would enable us to leverage the expertise and resources of industry leaders to turn our antibody and small molecule targets into therapeutics 
to that end  we established a strategic alliance with abgenix for the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies against our proprietary targets and a strategic alliance with bayer around the development of small molecules directed against our targets in diabetes and obesity 
as our pipeline has matured over the past few years  we have decreased our early stage target discovery efforts and increased resources for the advancement of our pipeline of protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics into clinical development 
today  we remain one of the leading genomics based pharmaceutical companies in the industry with a phase i product for cancer support and a deep pipeline of protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics 
technology we have assembled a comprehensive  proprietary  and large scale platform to understand the human genome and have laid the groundwork to better understand the biology behind disease 
using this foundation  we prioritized promising programs from what we believe to be the remaining intervention points appropriate for the development of novel therapeutics 
we identify pharmaceutically relevant genes and proteins and associate them with specific diseases through biological methods that include hypothesis driven disease models  drug response models  gene and pathway mining approaches  and human genetics 
we are developing a pipeline of protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics in the areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases  obesity and diabetes and central nervous system disorders 
we have used our proprietary technology to identify the pharmaceutically tractable genome ptg 
the ptg is the subset of human genes that we believe will make suitable therapeutic targets either because they are proteins that are shed in the blood and can be targeted by protein and antibody therapeutics  sit on cell surfaces and make suitable antibody and small molecule therapeutics  or belong to intracellular classes of proteins that can be modulated by small molecules 
we have identified the roughly  genes that make up the ptg and have used this foundation to systematically determine which are the most promising ones to develop as therapeutic candidates 
we have established disease programs for the identification of novel  pharmaceutically relevant targets and the association of these targets with specific diseases through process driven and hypothesis driven scientific strategies 
once associated with diseases  potential therapeutic target candidates are validated through cellular assays and animal model systems 
information resulting from these efforts is comprehensively managed through our bioinformatics system which is composed of tools and databases that have been designed specifically to manage  organize  and analyze this complementary biological information 
we are a leader in the emerging field of systems biology 
we have used our technologies to complete the world s first comprehensive protein interaction map for a multicellular organism  drosophila melanogaster 
that achievement was featured on the cover of and published in the december  edition of science 
we also were the first to complete a proteomics map of a eukaryotic organism  yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae 
that achievement was featured on the cover of and published in the february  edition of nature 
in addition  we have a proprietary set of human protein protein interaction data 
insight into the highly complex pathways of model organisms protein protein interactions  combined with our proprietary knowledge of human protein protein interactions  enhances our ability to select promising novel targets for drug development and continues to support our preclinical and clinical development efforts through the identification of biomarkers 
competition currently we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from biotechnology companies  pharmaceutical companies  academic and research institutions  and government agencies 
we also are subject to significant competition from organizations that are pursuing strategies  approaches  technologies and products that are the same as or similar to our own 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
in addition  research in the field of genomics is highly competitive 
our competitors in the genomics area include human genome sciences  inc  genentech  inc  zymogenetics  inc  amgen  inc  incyte pharmaceuticals  inc  major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  and universities and other research institutions including those receiving funding from the federally funded human genome project 
a number of our competitors are attempting to rapidly identify and patent genes and gene fragments sequenced at random  typically without specific knowledge of the function of such genes or gene fragments 
if our competitors discover or characterize important genes or gene fragments before we do  it could adversely affect any of our related disease research programs 
in addition  a number of competitors are producing proteins from genes and claiming both the proteins as potential therapeutics as well as claiming antibodies against these proteins 
in many cases generic antibody claims are being issued by the united states patent and trademark office uspto even though competitors have not actually made antibodies against the protein of interest  or do not have cellular  animal  or human data to support the use of these antibodies as therapeutics 
these claims on proteins as therapeutics and such claims covering all antibodies against the proteins and methods of use in broad human indications are being filed at a rapid rate  and some number of these claims have issued and may continue to issue 
we expect that competition in genomics research will intensify as technical advances are made and become more widely known 
the competition listed above was selected based upon identifying those companies that we feel have business models that are similar to ours 
intellectual property our business and competitive position depend on our ability to protect our genomic technologies  gene sequences  the proteins they encode  antibodies raised against them  other products  information systems and proprietary databases  software and other methods and technology 
we continually file patent applications for our proprietary methods and devices for sequencing  gene expression analysis  discovery of biological pathways and drug screening and development 
as of the date of this report  we had approximately patent applications pending covering genes and gene transcripts  the proteins they encode  antibodies raised against them  methods of use of therapeutic proteins or antibodies and the use of gene targets for small molecular screening  as well as for our products  processes and technologies with the uspto  as well as numerous corresponding international and foreign patent applications 
as of the date of this report  we had been issued approximately patents with respect to aspects of our gene portfolio  products  processes and technologies 
in  the uspto issued new guidelines for patent applications reflecting its current policy regarding statutory written description and utility requirements for patentability 
the implementation of these new guidelines may cause the uspto initially to reject some of our pending new gene and protein patent applications 
although we believe that we will overcome such rejections to any of our new gene and protein cases  there is no guarantee that the uspto will approve them 
we strive especially to gain issued patents for our commercially important genes and proteins 
the new guidelines are not expected to impact pending cases directed to technology platforms

life sciences corporation in june  we announced the formation of life sciences corporation 
this majority owned subsidiary was initially funded with million primarily from investors including us  soros fund management  llc  cooper hill partners  llc  and members of our senior management team 
in september  secured an additional million in equity financing from us and several existing shareholders  including cooper hill partners llc  to initiate commercialization of s product offering 
this second round of financing increased our ownership from to 
is developing novel nanoscale instrumentation and technologies for rapidly and comprehensively determining the nucleotide sequence whole genome sequencing of entire genomes 
s proprietary technology is expected to have widespread applications in industrial processes  agriculture  animal health  biodefense  human health care  including drug discovery and development  and disease diagnosis 
in august   utilizing its proprietary platform  submitted the whole genome sequence of an adenovirus to genbank  the national institutes of health genetic sequence database 
the submission marked the first time that a new method has been used to sequence a whole genome since walter gilbert and frederick sanger won the nobel prize in for the invention of dna sequencing in s technology platform is based on the application of massively parallel approaches to every step of the sequencing process sample preparation  dna sequencing  basecalling  sequence assembly and bioinformatic analysis 
this approach  combined with the use of advanced nanotechnology  reduces cost and throughput roadblocks to efficient whole genome analysis 
it is our goal to allow entire genomes to be analyzed without the cost and time restrictions normally associated with scaling up current methods of dna sequencing in large facilities 
scientists  using the technology platform  will be able to generate whole genome sequences for a wide variety of viral and bacterial organisms 
instead of looking for biologically meaningful regions in one bacterial genome  researchers will have at their disposal multiple strains of an organism for comparison 
this will provide information about new pathogens  drug resistant strains and variations in host pathogen interactions as mutation of pathogens occurs 
currently  is focusing on the analysis of viruses and bacteria 
anticipates that it will begin scaling its technology to analyze bacteria  fungi  larger model organisms  human dna  and other genomic applications during plans to sell both genomic analysis services and complete genomic analysis systems including instrumentation  reagents and software to end users 
the operations of are run by a separate management team and governed by a board of directors made up of members of our management team and board of directors 
has also established a scientific advisory board that is comprised of an elite group of scientists in the fields of whole genome sequencing  infectious disease  human genetics  chemical engineering and bioinformatics 
as this new technology is commercialized and its applications across the life sciences industry become accepted  we anticipate that will contribute revenue to the consolidated entity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for segment reporting 
government regulation prior to the marketing of any new therapeutic developed by us  or by our collaborators  that new therapeutic must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process in the united states and other countries 
this regulatory process  which includes preclinical and clinical studies to establish a compound s safety and efficacy  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from such studies are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the process for new drug approval has many steps  including investigational new drug application ind 
during the pre clinical testing  an ind is filed with the fda to begin human testing of the drug 
the ind becomes effective if not rejected by the fda within days 
all clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices  gcps 
in addition  an institutional review board  irb  comprised of physicians at the hospital or clinic where the proposed studies will be conducted  must review and approve the study 
the irb also continues to monitor the study for any safety issues 
progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the fda 
in addition  the fda may  at any time during the day period or at any time thereafter  impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials 
if the fda imposes a clinical hold  clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without fda authorization and then only under terms authorized by the fda 
in some instances  the ind application process can result in substantial delay and expense 
the ind must contain the following the results of pre clinical experiments  how  where and by whom the new clinical studies will be conducted  the chemical structure of the compound  or the sequence of a protein or antibody therapeutic  the mechanism by which it is believed to work in the human body  any toxic effects of the compound found in the animal studies  and how the compound  protein therapeutic or antibody therapeutic is manufactured 
clinical trials 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  which could possibly overlap 
the fda monitors the progress of each phase and may require the modification  suspension  or termination of a trial if it is determined to present excessive risks to patients 
the clinical trial process may also be accompanied by substantial delay and expense and there can be no assurance that the data generated in these studies will ultimately be sufficient for marketing approval by the fda 
new drug application nda 
after the completion of the clinical trial phases  and with considerable interaction with the fda  a company prepares an nda for submission to the fda 
the nda must contain all of the information on the drug gathered to that date  including data from the clinical trials 
the fda does a preliminary review of all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an nda for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the nda 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the fda has specified time frames in which to review the nda and respond to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission 
the fda may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
if fda evaluations of the nda and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda 
when and if those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
if the fda s evaluation of the nda submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda may refuse to approve the nda or issue a not approvable letter 
marketing approval 
if the fda approves the nda  the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe 
periodic reports must be submitted to the fda  including descriptions of any adverse reactions reported 
the fda may request additional studies phase iv to evaluate long term effects 
phase iv clinical trials and post marketing studies 
in addition to studies requested by the fda after approval  additional studies are conducted to explore new indications 
the purpose of these trials and related publications is to broaden the application and use of the drug and its acceptance in the medical community 
approvals in european union eu 
in  the eu established a system for the registration of medicinal products in the eu and under that system  marketing authorization may be submitted at either a centralized or decentralized level 
the centralized procedure is administered by the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products 
this procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and is available at the applicant s option for other innovative products 
the centralized procedure provides  for the first time in the eu  for the granting of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member states 
a mutual recognition procedure is available at the request of the applicant for all medicinal products that are not subject to the mandatory centralized procedure  under a decentralized procedure 
the decentralized procedure creates a new system for mutual recognition of national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu action on product suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more member states  certifying that identical dossiers are being submitted to all member states for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each member state must decide whether or not to recognize the approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
if such disputes cannot be resolved within the day period provided for review  the application will be subject to a binding arbitration procedure at the request of the applicant 
alternatively  the application may be withdrawn 
approvals outside of the united states and eu 
steps similar to those in the united states must be undertaken in virtually every other country comprising the market for our products before any such product can be commercialized in those countries 
the approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the united states 
there can be no assurance that the resulting prices would be sufficient to generate an acceptable return to us 
we have received fda clearance to conduct clinical trials for cg  a potential protein therapeutic for the treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients that are undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
none of our product candidates have been approved for commercialization in the united states or elsewhere 
we  or any of our collaborators  may not be able to conduct clinical testing or obtain the necessary approvals from the fda or other regulatory authorities for some products 
failure by us  or our collaborators  to obtain required governmental approvals will delay or preclude our collaborators or us from marketing therapeutics or diagnostic products developed with us or limit the commercial use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in february  the fda granted us orphan drug designation on cg  for the treatment of radiation induced oral mucositis 
the orphan drug act of is intended to encourage companies to develop therapies for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than  individuals in the united states at the time of application 
further criteria include the ability of the product to address an unmet medical need where no approved treatment option exists or provide significant benefit over available treatments 
orphan drug designation  granted by the fda s office of orphan products development  provides us with a number of potential benefits for cg orphan drug designation may result in seven years of market exclusivity in the united states upon fda product approval  provided that the sponsor company continues to meet certain conditions established by the fda 
upon marketing authorization and during the period of market exclusivity  the fda does not accept or approve other applications to market the same medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication 
other incentives provided by orphan designation include protocol assistance and eligibility for research and development support 
protocol assistance includes regulatory assistance and reduced filing fees  as well as advice on the conduct of clinical trials 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and controlled substances 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the acquisition  use  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products

in january  we entered into a five year lease agreement for an additional  square foot research facility in branford to allow us to further our pipeline efforts 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations or that suitable additional leased space will be available as needed 
our plans to construct a new corporate headquarters and protein production facility in branford have been deferred indefinitely  pending improvements in the external financing environment which would afford us the ability to finance the future construction costs

we needed additional earnings  as indicated by the deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges for each of the periods presented above  to achieve a ratio of earnings to fixed charges of x 
the deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges is computed by subtracting fixed charges from earnings before income taxes and minority interest plus fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of interest expense plus that portion of net rental expense deemed representative of interest 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a genomics based pharmaceutical development company dedicated to improving the lives of patients by developing novel protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics in the areas of oncology  inflammatory diseases  obesity and diabetes  and central nervous system disorders 
our pipeline of therapeutics is based on targets from the human genome that we believe play a role in important mechanisms underlying disease 
we have taken a systematic approach to identifying and validating the most promising therapeutic targets from the human genome that are both applicable and amenable to drug development 
we use internal resources to develop our protein therapeutics and have established development alliances with abgenix  inc abgenix to support our antibody projects and bayer ag bayer to support small molecule projects 
as our pipeline has matured over the past few years  we have decreased our early stage target discovery efforts and focused our resources on the advancement of our pipeline of protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics into clinical development 
in  we received us food and drug administration fda clearance to conduct phase i clinical trials for cg  a potential protein therapeutic for the treatment of oral mucositis in cancer patients that are undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy 
cr  which is the most advanced fully human monoclonal antibody stemming from our collaboration with abgenix  is currently in preclinical development and we anticipate filing an investigational new drug application ind for  and initiating clinical trials of  cr in the near future 
cr is a novel fully human monoclonal antibody with the potential to treat a form of kidney inflammation that if left untreated could progress to kidney failure 
in addition to cg and cr  we have over potential protein  antibody and small molecule therapeutics currently being evaluated in animal studies or being prepared for animal studies 
many of the inds that we anticipate filing in the future will be identified from these programs 
to enable us to focus on our pipeline  we announced the formation of life sciences corporation in june this majority owned subsidiary is developing novel nanoscale instrumentation and technologies for rapidly and comprehensively determining the nucleotide sequence whole genome sequencing of entire genomes 
s proprietary technology is expected to have widespread applications in industrial processes  agriculture  animal health  biodefense  human health care  including drug discovery and development  and disease diagnosis 
currently  is focusing on the analysis of viruses and bacteria and anticipates that it will begin scaling its technology to analyze bacteria  fungi  larger model organisms  human dna  and other genomic applications during plans to sell both genomic analysis services and complete genomic analysis systems  including instrumentation  reagents and software to end users 
we expect to generate value for our shareholders by focusing our resources on developing genomics based therapeutics to improve the lives of patients 
we expect to become profitable by commercializing a subset of therapeutics stemming from our development pipeline  and establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the co development and co commercialization of other therapeutics from our development pipeline 
our failure to successfully develop pharmaceutical products that we can commercialize would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated from commercial sales of products developed through the application of our technologies and expertise are not expected for several years  if at all 
we expect that our revenue or income sources for at least the next several years may be limited to interest income  payments under various collaboration agreements to the extent milestones are met  royalty payments from collaborators under existing or future arrangements to the extent that we enter into any future arrangements  and service and product revenue which is expected in  as s technology is commercialized and its applications across the life sciences industry become accepted 
we expect to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to our research and development efforts  as we focus on preclinical and clinical trials required for the development of therapeutic protein  antibody and small molecule product candidates  and as focuses on the continued development and commercialization of its technology for whole genome analysis 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product  we must demonstrate through various studies that a product is both effective and safe for use in humans 
we will incur substantial expenses for  and devote a significant amount of time to  these studies 
as a result  we expect to incur continued and increasing losses over the next several years  unless we are able to realize additional revenues under existing or new collaboration agreements or through s sales of genomic analysis services and or complete genomic analysis systems 
the timing and amounts of such revenues  if any  cannot be predicted with certainty and may fluctuate 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to the results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
the and consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the classifications used in all dollar amounts in tabular presentations are shown in thousands  unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and as such  actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies and uses of estimates research and development expenses 
research and development costs have been our most significant costs to date and primarily include personnel costs  supplies and reagents  clinical trial related costs such as contractual services and manufacturing costs  depreciation of lab equipment and allocated facility costs 
such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred unless recoverable under contract 
our research and development expenses also include accruals for clinical trial related costs such as contractual services and current manufacturing costs 
at each period end  we estimate the costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced  and we analyze the progress of these services based upon information received from the supplier when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities 
significant judgments and estimates must be used in determining the related accruals in any accounting period 
actual results could differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions 
revenue recognition 
we have entered into certain collaborative research agreements that provide for the partial or complete funding of specified projects in exchange for access to  and certain rights in  the data discovered under the related projects 
collaboration revenue is recognized based upon defined metrics of completion that include percentage of completion milestones  and project specific initiatives as defined in each of the respective research plans 
the defined metrics are reviewed internally each month to determine the work performed  whether deliverables have been accepted by the collaborator and the appropriate revenue to be recognized 
we have also entered into a collaborative research exchange agreement in which services and technology access are exchanged between the collaborative partner and us 
collaboration revenues and expenses under this exchange agreement include the fair value of the work performed by each collaborative partner 
deferred revenue arising from payments received from collaborative research agreements is recognized as income when earned 
results of operations the following table sets forth a comparison of the components of our net loss for the years ended december  and in millions change change collaboration revenue research and development expenses general and administrative expenses restructuring and related charges interest income interest expense income tax benefit minority interest in subsidiary loss net loss collaboration revenue 
the decrease in collaboration revenue for the year ended december  was primarily a result of a decline in revenue recognized from the abgenix strategic alliance 
also reflected in the decrease was the on going change in our business strategy  which is to establish strategic research and development alliances with companies for the co development and co commercialization of therapeutics from our development pipeline  rather than focusing on short term revenue generating service based collaborations 
in addition  during the setup phase of the bayer alliance was completed and we received a related milestone payment  resulting in a transition to the production phase of that alliance 
we expect that collaboration revenue will remain fairly constant as compared to  reflecting continued progress of the bayer alliance and various other collaborations  as well as the inclusion of nominal revenues expected from the commercialization of s new technology 
research and development expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily due to implementation of corporate restructuring plans in late and mid  intended to reduce overall costs and focus resources on prioritizing  selecting and advancing our most promising drug candidates 
we anticipate that research and development expenses  particularly with respect to our preclinical and clinical trials  will increase in as we continue to advance our pipeline of protein  antibody  and small molecule therapeutics and as expenses increase in preparation for  and in connection with  the expected commercialization of s technology 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to the implementation of corporate restructuring plans 
additionally  lower intellectual property expenses are indicative of the shift in our focus from early stage discovery efforts to the advancement of our therapeutic development efforts 
general and administrative expenses are expected to increase slightly in restructuring and related charges 
restructuring and related charges of approximately million were incurred in the second quarter of as a part of our june corporate restructuring plan which was intended to focus resources on continuing to advance our pipeline of therapeutics into preclinical and clinical development 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we incurred million related to employee separation costs  million of operating lease obligations and million of asset impairment costs 
the employee separation costs were recorded under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas and included amounts to be paid for severance and related benefits  the services for which had been performed in full as of the end of the cash requirements under the june restructuring plan were million  of which million were paid prior to december  the remaining cash requirements of million will be paid through the end of the components of our restructuring charges are set forth on page interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to lower yields in our investment portfolio and a decrease in cash and investment balances during we earned an average yield of in as compared to in during  we anticipate that interest income will increase as compared to  as a result of the receipt of net proceeds of approximately million from our convertible subordinated notes due  which we issued on february   offset by the utilization of cash and investment balances in the normal course of operations 
in we expect the yields in our investment portfolio to be consistent with however  in the event that in we use a portion of the net proceeds of the debt offering due to repay our existing debt due  our anticipation of an increase in interest income for will differ accordingly 
interest expense 
we expect a significant increase in interest expense during  attributable to interest to be paid semi annually to the holders of our million of convertible subordinated notes due  which we issued on february  income tax benefit 
for the year ended december   the income tax benefit decrease was a result of the decline in various expenses which qualified for the annual research and development credit as a result of the corporate restructuring plan  primarily personnel costs  supplies and reagents  and intellectual property expenses 
we recorded the income tax benefit as a result of connecticut legislation  which allowed companies to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut at a rate of of their annual research and development expense credit  in exchange for forgoing the credit carryforward 
in addition  due to s focus on revenues to be realized in the short term  elected not to request a cash refund for  but instead elected to continue to carry forward the credit 
minority interest in subsidiary loss 
minority interest in subsidiary loss for the year ended december  which is the portion of s loss attributable to shareholders of other than us increased primarily due to s additional efforts to advance its technology 
during  losses attributed to the minority ownership in are expected to remain fairly constant as compared to  as continues to make progress towards commercializing and developing new technologies 
the following table sets forth a comparison of the components of our net loss for the years ended december  and in millions change change collaboration revenue research and development expenses general and administrative expenses restructuring and related charges n a interest income interest expense income tax benefit minority interest in subsidiary loss net loss collaboration revenue 
the decrease in collaboration revenue for the year ended december  reflected a change in our business strategy which is to establish strategic research and development alliances with companies for the co development and co commercialization of therapeutics from our development pipeline  rather than focusing on short term revenue generating service based collaborations 
the decline in collaboration revenue can also be attributed to the completion in of various short term service based collaborations including glaxosmithkline  inc and millennium pharmaceuticals  inc formerly cor therapeutics  inc the decrease in collaboration revenue was also a result of the progression of the bayer alliance during from the set up phase to the production phase  offset by additional revenue recognized from the abgenix strategic alliance 
research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to increased internal research efforts and our obligations to fulfill research requirements under existing collaborations and strategic alliances  which included payments for contractual services  increased equipment depreciation expense and additional personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased primarily due to legal expenses in support of the development of our intellectual property portfolio and additional personnel costs 
restructuring and related charges 
restructuring and related charges of approximately million were incurred in as a part of our restructuring plan which was intended to reduce costs and focus resources on prioritizing  selecting and rapidly advancing our most promising drug candidates 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we incurred million related to employee separation costs and million of asset impairment costs related to equipment no longer in service 
the employee separation costs were recorded under sfas and included amounts to be paid for severance and related benefits  the services for which had been performed in full as of the end of the cash requirements under the restructuring plan were million  of which million were paid prior to december   and the remaining cash requirements of million were paid by the end of also included in restructuring and related charges was an asset impairment of million  consisting of costs previously incurred in conjunction with the planned construction of a campus facility  including a new corporate headquarters and protein production facility in branford  connecticut 
plans to construct these facilities have been deferred indefinitely  pending improvements in the external financing environment  which would afford us the ability to finance the future construction costs 
interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to lower yields in our investment portfolio and a decrease in cash and investment balances during we earned an average yield of in as compared to in minority interest in subsidiary loss 
minority interest in subsidiary loss for the year ended december  which is the portion of s loss attributable to shareholders of other than us increased primarily due to s additional personnel costs  increased purchases of laboratory supplies  increased equipment depreciation expense and payments for consulting and contractual services as a result of the continued development of their technology platform 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through public equity offerings  private placements of equity securities  convertible subordinated debt offerings  revenues received under our collaborative research agreements and government grants  capital leases and exercises of stock options 
as of december   we had recognized million of cumulative sponsored research revenues from collaborative research agreements and government grants 
at december   our gross investment in lab and office equipment  computers  land and leasehold improvements was million  and equipment with a gross book value of million secured our capital lease facilities 
since inception  we have not had any off balance sheet arrangements 
to date  inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
cash and investments 
the following table depicts the components of our operating  investing and financing activities for the year ended december   using the direct cash flow method in millions cash received from collaborators cash paid to suppliers and employees restructuring and related charges paid interest income received interest expense paid income tax benefit received net cash and investments used in operating activities cash paid to acquire property and equipment  net of sales proceeds cash paid to acquire intangible assets net cash and investments used in investing activities cash paid for principal portion of capital leases cash received from outside investors  net of stock issuance costs cash received from employee stock option exercises and restricted stock grants net cash and investments provided by financing activities unrealized loss on marketable securities net decrease in cash and investments cash and investments  beginning of period cash and investments  end of period the decrease in cash and investments for was primarily a result of additional operating losses in support of our research and development activities and acquisitions of additional property and equipment and intangible assets  offset by proceeds received in s equity financing from several existing minority shareholders 
in accordance with our investment policy  we are utilizing the following investment objectives for cash and investments investment decisions are made with the expectation of minimum risk of principal loss  even with a modest penalty in yield  appropriate cash balances and related short term funds are maintained for immediate liquidity needs  and appropriate liquidity is available for medium term cash needs  and maximum after tax yield is achieved 
future liquidity sources of liquidity 
during  we expect to continue to fund our operations through a combination of the following sources cash and investment balances  interest income  collaboration revenue  and potential public securities offerings and or private strategic driven common stock offerings 
uses of liquidity 
throughout  we plan to continue making substantial investments in our emerging preclinical and clinical drug pipeline 
in that regard  we foresee the following as significant uses of liquidity personnel costs  supplies and reagents  clinical trial related costs such as contractual services and manufacturing costs  interest expense related to payments made to the holders of our convertible subordinated debt issued in february and february  and capital expenditures 
these costs will be incurred primarily in connection with the following preclinical and clinical efforts ongoing clinical trial costs and anticipated phase ii manufacturing costs on our protein therapeutic cg in the area of oral mucositis  costs related to our manufacturing agreement with abgenix for cr  toxicology costs to support our planned submission of an ind for cr  preclinical and clinical costs in connection with the use of our protein therapeutic cg to treat alternative clinical indications  and legal expenses in support of the continued protection of our intellectual property portfolio 
we anticipate that we will also incur significant capital expenditures in  primarily for the expansion of our existing protein production laboratory facilities  in addition to the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements at both our and s research facilities and administrative offices 
contractual obligations the following table represents our consolidated contractual obligations as of december  payments due year ended december  total thereafter long term debt obligations interest on convertible subordinated debt capital leases operating leases purchase commitments other long term liabilities total refer to note and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
includes commitments for capital expenditures and contractual services  but excludes amounts included on our balance sheet as liabilities and certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
on february   we completed an offering of million of convertible subordinated notes due and received net proceeds of approximately million 
in february  we also repurchased million of our existing convertible subordinated debentures due we will pay cash interest of million on the notes on february and august of each year  beginning on august  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
purchase obligations for supplies and reagents are not included in the table above  as our purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current operating needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies and reagents specifying minimum quantities or set prices 
additionally  we have entered into agreements for contractual services primarily relating to the manufacturing costs of our protein therapeutic cg  and our fully human monoclonal antibody cr  and have included these amounts in purchase commitments above 
on february   we completed an offering for million of convertible subordinated notes due february   and received net proceeds of approximately million 
depending on market and other conditions  from time to time  we may repurchase a portion of the existing notes in open market purchases  in privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
in addition  we also may use net proceeds for working capital  general corporate purposes and potentially for future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies 
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and extent of our acquisitions  our product development activities  our investments in technology and the amount of cash generated by our operations 
actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates 
our failure to use such funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in february  we repurchased million of our convertible subordinated debentures due  for total consideration of million  plus accrued interest of million to the date of repurchase 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our requirements for the next twenty four months 
our operating and capital expenditures are considered to be crucial to our future success  and by continuing to make strategic investments in our preclinical and clinical drug pipeline  we believe that we are building substantial value for our shareholders 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements  including the repayment of our remaining million of convertible subordinated debentures due february  and our million of convertible subordinated notes due february   will depend on many factors 
these factors include the number  breadth and progress of our research  product development and clinical programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products  potential future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  in licensing of pharmaceutical products  and costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
while we will continue to explore alternative sources for financing our business activities  including the possibility of public securities offerings and or private strategic driven common stock offerings  we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products 
we received federal grants during and earlier years  for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies 
such audits could lead to requests for reimbursement by the grantor agency for any expenditures disallowed under the terms of the grant 
additionally  any noncompliance with the terms of the grant could lead to loss of current or future awards 
during to  we also received two grants from connecticut innovations  inc cii in the amounts of million and million 
the term of the million grant is january  to december   and the term of the million grant is february  to january  we could be required to repay of these amounts if during the terms of the respective grants i we breach and fail to cure a material covenant  ii a we fail to cure any of our material representations or warranties that become untrue  iii we become bankrupt or insolvent or liquidate our assets  or iv we are required to repay the federal grants to which the cii grants relate 
in addition  we could be required to repay up to of the amounts of the cii grants if we cease to have a connecticut presence  during the terms of the respective grants 
income taxes for income tax purposes  we do not file consolidated income tax returns with we and have tax net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future federal and connecticut taxable income and research and development tax credit carryforwards available to offset future federal and connecticut income taxes as detailed below 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited due to changes within each company s ownership  as defined within section of the internal revenue code

minority interest in subsidiary is related to and reflects the minority shareholders capitalization  less a gain recognition of million as a result of our contribution of technology to in  and less the minority shareholders portion of losses incurred to date 
the loss attributed to the minority ownership in is expected to remain fairly constant during  as continues to make progress towards commercializing and developing new technologies

risk factors risks related to our business because our business strategy is still largely untested  we do not know whether we will be able to commercialize any of our products or to what extent we will generate revenue or become profitable 
we do not know whether we can implement our business strategy successfully because we are in the early stages of development 
initially  we set out to find as many genes and their related functions as possible and are now using that information to develop our own therapeutic products 
this strategy is largely untested 
other companies first target particular diseases and try to find cures for them  have a limited number of genes and proteins of potential therapeutic interest  or rely on other more proven strategies 
if our strategy does not result in the development of products that we can commercialize  we will be unable to generate revenue 
we have not completed development of any product based on our genomics research 
although our first potential product has entered clinical trials  we cannot be certain that this or any future products will receive marketing approval 
if we are unable to commercialize products  we may not be able to recover our investment in our product development efforts 
because clinical trials for our products will be expensive and protracted and their outcome is uncertain  we must invest substantial amounts of time and money that may not yield viable products 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product  we must demonstrate through laboratory  animal and human studies that such product is both effective and safe for use in humans 
we will incur substantial expense for  and devote a significant amount of time to  these studies 
completion of clinical trials may take many years 
the length of time required varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
the fda monitors the progress of each phase of testing  and may require the modification  suspension  or termination of a trial if it is determined to present excessive risks to patients 
our rate of commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors  including our inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  variability in the number and types of patients available for each study  as well as the difficulty in enrolling patients in each study  difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data  unforeseen safety issues or side effects  poor or unanticipated effectiveness of products during the clinical trials  institutional review board delays at institutions assisting us with our clinical trials  and government or regulatory delays 
studies that we conduct  or studies which third parties conduct on our behalf  may not demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for these or any other potential products 
regulatory authorities may not permit us to undertake any additional clinical trials 
the clinical trial process may be accompanied by substantial delay and expense and there can be no assurance that the data generated in these studies ultimately will be sufficient for marketing approval by the fda 
we have only one product in clinical development and our other products are in preclinical development 
none of these products may demonstrate sufficient effectiveness or safety to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals required for initiation or continuation of clinical studies or obtaining marketing approval 
because we have limited experience in developing  commercializing and marketing products  we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to do so 
currently  we are developing several potential pharmaceutical products  and such products will require significant research and development and preclinical testing  and will require extensive clinical testing prior to our submitting any regulatory application for their commercial use 
although we are conducting human studies with respect to one product  we have limited experience with these activities and may not be successful in developing or commercializing these or other products 
these activities  if undertaken without the collaboration of others  will require the expenditure of significant funds 
such potential pharmaceutical products will be subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products based on new technologies 
before we can commercialize a product  we must rigorously test the product in the laboratory and complete extensive human studies 
even if we complete such studies  our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to complete laboratory testing and human studies  obtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products  obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals related to the efficacy and safety of our products  enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture our products on our behalf  and deploy sales and marketing resources effectively or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide these functions 
as a result of these possibilities  we may not be able to develop through our research and development activities any commercially viable products 
we cannot be certain that expenses for testing and study will yield profitable products or even products approved for marketing by the fda 
if we are not successful in identifying products that we can develop commercially  we may be unable to recover the large investment we have made in research  development and manufacturing 
in addition  should we choose to develop pharmaceutical products internally  we will have to make significant investments in pharmaceutical product development  marketing  sales and regulatory compliance resources  and we will have to establish or contract for the manufacture of products under the current good manufacturing practices cgmps of the fda 
any potential products developed by our licensees will be subject to the same risks 
we do not have any marketed products 
if we develop products that can be marketed  we intend to market the products either independently or together with collaborators or strategic partners 
if we decide to market any products independently  we will incur significant additional expenditures and commit significant additional management resources to establish a sales force 
for any products that we market together with partners  we will rely  in whole or in part  on the marketing capabilities of those parties 
we may also contract with third parties to market certain of our products 
ultimately  we and our partners may not be successful in marketing our products 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers and depend on them to manufacture and supply critical components of our development and clinical programs 
currently  we contract with third party manufacturers or develop products with partners and use the partners manufacturing capabilities 
as we use others to manufacture our products  we depend on those parties to comply with cgmps  and other regulatory requirements and to deliver materials on a timely basis 
these parties may not perform adequately 
any failures by these third parties may delay our development of products or the submission of these products for regulatory approval 
we depend on third party research organizations to design and conduct our laboratory testing and human studies 
if we are unable to obtain any necessary testing services on acceptable terms  we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
as we rely on third parties for laboratory testing and human studies  we may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties 
these third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we request 
because neither we nor any of our collaborative partners have received marketing approval for any product resulting from our research and development efforts  and may never be able to obtain any such approval  we may not be able to generate any product revenue 
all the products being developed by our collaborative partners also will require additional research and development  extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval prior to any commercial sales 
in some cases  the length of time that it takes for our collaborative partners to achieve various regulatory approval milestones may affect the payments that we are eligible to receive under our collaboration agreements 
we and our collaborative partners may need to address a number of technical challenges successfully in order to complete development of our products 
moreover  these products may not be effective in treating any disease or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use 
we may be unable to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of our products and ensure their proper performance and quality 
biopharmaceuticals must be produced under the cgmps of the fda 
we do not have facilities capable of manufacturing drug products under cgmps and must outsource any such production 
we are devoting resources to establishing our own manufacturing capabilities to support development and preclinical activities and are contracting with third party vendors for the manufacture of materials for use in humans 
we may be unable to contract successfully for cgmps manufacture of any products and may be unable to obtain required quantities of our products economically 
we may not be able to obtain capacity to produce a sufficient amount of commercial product to meet our commercial and clinical development needs 
failure to meet the demand for product may adversely affect our ability to continue to market the product 
compliance with government regulation is critical to our business and failure to satisfy regulatory requirements could impair our business 
prior to the marketing of any new drug developed by us  or by our collaborators  that new drug must undergo an extensive regulatory review process in the united states and other countries 
this regulatory process  which includes preclinical and clinical studies  as well as post marketing surveillance to establish a compound s safety and efficacy  can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from such studies are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
even if the fda approves our products  we will still need to obtain institutional review board approval  which may involve additional delays 
the rate of completion of clinical trials depends upon  among other factors  the enrollment of patients 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including timing and restriction of institutional review board approval  the size of the patient population  proximity of patients to clinical sites  eligibility criteria for the study  time commitment of a patient to the study  and existence of competitive clinical trials 
we have not had any of our product candidates receive approval for commercialization in the united states or elsewhere 
neither we nor our collaborators may be able to conduct clinical testing or obtain the necessary approvals from the fda or other regulatory authorities for any products 
failure by us or our collaborators to obtain required governmental approvals will delay or preclude our collaborators or us from marketing drugs developed with us or limit the commercial use of such products and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even where a product is exempted from fda clearance or approval  the fda may impose restrictions as to the types of customers to which we can market and sell our products 
such restrictions may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the fda may condition marketing approval on the conduct of specific post marketing studies to further evaluate safety and efficacy 
rigorous and extensive fda regulation of pharmaceutical products continues after approval  particularly with respect to compliance with cgmps reporting of adverse effects  advertising  promotion and marketing 
discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions  any of which could materially adversely affect our business 
we must obtain regulatory approval by governmental agencies in other countries prior to commercialization of our products in those countries 
foreign regulatory systems may be just as rigorous  costly and uncertain as in the united states 
we rely significantly on our collaborative partners  and our business could be harmed if we are unable to maintain strategic alliances 
as part of our business strategy  we have strategic research and development alliances with companies to gain access to specific technologies 
these alliances with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may provide us with access to unique technologies  access to capital  near term revenues  milestone and or royalty payments  and potential profit sharing arrangements 
in return  we provide access to unique technologies  expertise in genomics  and information on the molecular basis of disease  drug targets  and drug candidates 
to date  we have entered into significant strategic alliances with abgenix and bayer  in addition to numerous smaller agreements to facilitate these efforts 
in these strategic alliances  either party can terminate the agreement at any time the alliance permits them to or if either party materially breaches the contract 
we may not be able to maintain or expand existing alliances or establish any additional alliances 
if any of our existing collaborators were to breach  terminate or not renew their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct activities successfully and in a timely manner  the preclinical or clinical development or commercialization of product candidates or research programs may be delayed or terminated 
we depend on attracting and retaining key employees 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including jonathan m 
rothberg  phd  our chief executive officer  president and chairman of the board  david m 
wurzer  executive vice president and chief financial officer  christopher k 
mcleod  executive vice president  timothy m 
shannon  md  executive vice president and chief medical officer  and richard f 
begley  phd  president and chief executive officer of the loss of services of any of these personnel could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we entered into employment agreements with all of the principal members of our management and scientific staff that bind them to a specific term of employment 
we maintain key person life insurance on the life of dr 
rothberg in the amount of million 
our future success also will depend in part on the continued services of our key scientific and management personnel and our ability to attract  hire and retain additional personnel 
there is intense competition for such qualified personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could materially  adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on academic collaborators  consultants and scientific advisors 
we have relationships with collaborators and consultants at academic and other institutions who conduct research at our request 
these collaborators and consultants are not our employees 
substantially all of our collaborators and consultants are employed by employers other than us and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
as a result  we have limited control over their activities and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration and consulting agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
our ability to discover genes and biological pathways involved in human disease and commercialize products based on those discoveries may depend in part on continued collaborations with researchers at academic and other institutions 
we may not be able to negotiate additional acceptable collaborations with collaborators or consultants at academic and other institutions 
our academic collaborators  consultants and scientific advisors may have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which could compete with us 
our academic collaborators  consultants and scientific advisors sign agreements which provide for confidentiality of our proprietary information and of the results of studies 
we may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of our technology and other confidential information in connection with every academic collaboration or advisory arrangement  and any unauthorized dissemination of our confidential information could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  any such collaborator  consultant or advisor may enter into an employment agreement or consulting arrangement with one of our competitors 
competition in our field is intense and likely to increase 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from one or more of the following entities biotechnology companies  pharmaceutical companies  academic and research institutions  and government agencies 
we also are subject to significant competition from organizations that are pursuing approaches  technologies and products that are the same as  or similar to  our technology and products 
many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
in addition  research in the field of genomics  protein therapeutics  and fully human antibodies generally is highly competitive 
our competitors include human genome sciences  inc  genentech  inc  zymogenetics  inc  amgen  inc  incyte pharmaceuticals  inc  major biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  and universities and other non profit research organizations 
a number of organizations are attempting to rapidly identify and patent genes and gene fragments sequenced at random  typically without specific knowledge of the function of such genes or gene fragments 
if our competitors discover or characterize important genes or gene fragments before we do  it could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products 
we expect that competition in genomics research  protein therapeutics  and therapeutic antibodies will intensify as technical advances are made and become more widely known 
in addition  a number of competitors are producing proteins from genes and claiming both the proteins as potential therapeutics as well as claiming antibodies against these proteins 
in many cases generic antibody claims are being issued by the united states patent and trademark office uspto even though competitors have not actually made antibodies against the protein of interest  or do not have cellular  animal  or human data to support the use of these antibodies as therapeutics 
these claims on proteins as therapeutics and these claims covering all antibodies against the proteins and methods of use in broad human indications are being filed at a rapid rate  and some number of these claims have issued and may continue to issue 
in addition  purified proteins  therapeutic data  and antibodies  including polyclonal antibodies  mouse monoclonal antibodies and  in some cases  fully human monoclonal antibodies  are being generated against a large number of targets within the human genome 
all of these activities may make it difficult to commercialize products  or  if licenses are made available  may make the royalty burden on these products so high as to prevent commercial success 
we may engage in acquisitions that are unsuccessful 
in the future  we may engage in acquisitions in order to exploit technology or market opportunities 
we are not experienced in acquiring and integrating new businesses 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to integrate the acquired business successfully into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner or at all 
furthermore  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve material non recurring charges and amortization of significant amounts of non cash acquisition costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 
if our patent applications do not result in issued patents  then our competitors may obtain rights to commercialize our discoveries 
our business and competitive position depends on our ability to protect our products  processes and technologies 
we continually file patent applications for our proprietary methods  novel uses of genes  and our development products 
as of the date of this report  we had approximately patent applications pending covering novel genes and gene transcripts  as well as our products  processes and technologies with the uspto  and had filed numerous corresponding international and foreign patent applications 
as of the date of this report  we had been issued approximately patents with respect to aspects of our gene portfolio  products  processes and technologies 
our commercial success also depends in part on obtaining patent protection on genes and proteins for which we or our collaborators discover utility and on products  methods and services based on such discoveries 
we have applied for patent protection on novel genes and proteins  novel mutants of known genes and their uses  partial sequences of novel proteins and their gene sequences and uses  and novel uses for previously identified genes discovered by third parties 
we have applied for patents on antibodies against the proteins we have discovered  as well as seek or have our partners seek patent protection on the antibodies we produce against these proteins 
we have sought and intend to continue to seek patent protection for novel uses for genes and proteins and therapeutic antibodies that may have been patented by third parties 
in such cases  we would need a license from the holder of the patent with respect to such gene or protein in order to make  use or sell such gene or protein for such use 
we may not be able to acquire such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our patent application filings that result from the identification of genes associated with the cause or effect of a particular disease generally seek to protect the genes and the proteins encoded by such genes as well as antibodies raised against these gene products 
we also seek patent protection for our therapeutic  diagnostic and drug screening methods and products 
in  the uspto issued new guidelines for patent applications reflecting the uspto s current policy regarding statutory written description and utility requirements for patentability 
the implementation of these new guidelines may cause the uspto initially to reject some of our pending new gene and protein patent applications 
there is no guarantee that the uspto will approve them 
we strive especially to gain issued patents for our commercially important genes and proteins 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including us  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
our patent applications may not protect our products  processes and technologies because of the following reasons there is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in additional issued patents  we may develop additional proprietary technologies that are not patentable  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will provide a basis for commercially viable products  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will provide us with any competitive advantages  there is no guarantee that any patents issued to us or our collaborative customers will not be challenged or circumvented or invalidated by third parties  and there is no guarantee that any patents issued to others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
in addition  patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies  duplicate any of our technologies  or  if patents are issued to us  design around the patented technologies developed by us 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend ourselves in patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate such suits 
the issuance of patents may not provide us with sufficient protection 
we may not be able to obtain further patents for our products  processes and technologies  or  if we are able to obtain further patents  these patents may not provide us with substantial protection or be commercially beneficial 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability  nor does it provide the patent holder with freedom to operate without infringing the patent rights of others 
a patent could be challenged by litigation and  if the outcome of such litigation were adverse to the patent holder  competitors could be free to use the subject matter covered by the patent  or the patent holder may license the technology to others in settlement of such litigation 
the invalidation of key patents owned by or licensed to us or non approval of pending patent applications could increase competition  and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any application or exploitation of our technology could infringe patents or proprietary rights of others and any licenses that we might need as a result of such infringement might not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
third parties have indicated to us that they believe we may be required to obtain a license in order to perform certain processes that we use in the conduct of our business or in order to market potential drugs we have in development 
we cannot predict whether our or our competitors pending patent applications will result in the issuance of valid patents 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  also may be necessary to enforce our patent and proprietary rights and or to determine the scope and validity of others proprietary rights 
we may participate in interference proceedings that may in the future be declared by the uspto to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost to us 
the outcome of any such litigation or interference proceeding might not be favorable to us  and we might not be able to obtain licenses to technology that we require or that  if obtainable  we could license such technology at a reasonable cost 
the public availability of genomic sequence information or other sequence information prior to the time we apply for patent protection on a corresponding full length or partial gene could adversely affect our ability to obtain patent protection with respect to such gene or gene sequences 
in addition  certain other groups are attempting to rapidly identify and characterize genes through the use of gene expression analysis and other technologies 
to the extent any patents issue to other parties on such partial or full length genes or uses for such genes  the risk increases that the sale of potential products  including therapeutics  or processes developed by us or our collaborators may give rise to claims of patent infringement 
others may have filed and in the future are likely to file patent applications covering genes or gene products or antibodies against the gene products that are similar or identical to our products 
any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications 
any legal action against us or our collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products and processes could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our collaborators to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes or could enjoin us from continuing to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
there can be no assurance that we or our collaborators would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any such patent would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
we believe that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in such litigation  it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources 
there is substantial uncertainty concerning the extent to which supportive data will be required for issuance of patents for human therapeutics 
if data additional to that available to us is required  our ability to obtain patent protection could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected 
although the uspto issued new utility guidelines in july that address the requirements for demonstrating utility for biotechnology inventions  particularly for inventions relating to human therapeutics  there can be no assurance that the uspto examiners will follow such guidelines or that the uspto s position will not change with respect to what is required to establish utility for gene sequences and products and methods based on such sequences 
we cannot be certain that our security measures will protect our proprietary technologies 
we also rely upon trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information that is not subject matter for which patent protection is being sought 
we have developed a database of proprietary gene expression patterns and biological pathways which we update on an ongoing basis and which can be accessed over the internet 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary technologies  processes  information systems and data and continue to explore ways to enhance such security 
such measures  however  may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
while we require employees  academic collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality and or non disclosure agreements where appropriate  any of the following could still occur proprietary information could be disclosed  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technology  or we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
we depend upon our ability to license technologies 
we may have to acquire or license certain components of our technologies or products from third parties 
we may not be able to acquire from third parties or develop new technologies  either alone or with others 
failure to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the life sciences technology platform is in development and the early stages of commercialization 
the technology platform of  our majority owned subsidiary see business life sciences corporation  is still in development and has not had significant sales of its services or products 
may not be able to continue to successfully develop or commercialize the technology platform 
the success of commercialization of the technology platform depends on many factors  including the acceptance of s technology in the market place  technical performance of s platform in relation to existing technologies  s ability to obtain key components for the manufacture of the instrument and reagents from suppliers  and s ability to obtain licenses to resell reagents for use in the instrument  if required 
is subject to competition from organizations that have developed or are developing technologies and products to service s potential customers 
many of the organizations competing with potentially have greater capital resources  research and development staffs and facilities and marketing capabilities 
s potential competitors include applied biosystems  amersham biosciences  affymetrix  perlegen  and other companies recently formed or soon to be funded to develop whole genome sequencing technologies 
we believe that the future success of will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position in instruments for the high throughput nucleic acid sequencing field 
before we recover development expenses for our products or technologies  such products or technologies may become obsolete as a result of technological developments by us or others 
our products could also be made obsolete by new technologies which are less expensive or more effective 
we may not be able to make the enhancements to our technology necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
a market for the high throughput nucleic acid sequencing field may not be sufficient to generate revenues significant enough for to achieve profitability 
we could be liable for any failure to comply with hazardous product regulations 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of such materials and certain waste products 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by federal  state and local laws and regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result and any liability could exceed our resources 
risks related to our financial results we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses in the future 
we have incurred losses since inception  principally as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we anticipate incurring additional losses over the next several years as we focus our resources on prioritizing  selecting and advancing our most promising drug candidates 
we may never be profitable or achieve significant revenues 
for example  we experienced net losses of million in  million in and million in  and as of december  had an accumulated deficit of million 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated greatly and may continue to do so 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis 
we expect that losses will continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that these fluctuations may be substantial 
our results of operations are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may cause our stock price to decline and result in losses to investors 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include changes in the demand for our services  the nature  pricing and timing of products and services provided to our collaborators  our ability to compete effectively in our therapeutic discovery and development efforts against competitors that have greater financial or other resources or drug candidates that are in further stages of development  acquisition  licensing and other costs related to the expansion of our operations  losses and expenses related to our investments  regulatory developments or changes in public perceptions relating to the use of genetic information and the diagnosis and treatment of disease based on genetic information  regulatory actions and changes related to the development of drugs  changes in intellectual property laws that affect our patent rights  payments of milestones  license fees or research payments under the terms of our external alliances and collaborations and our ability to monitor and enforce such payments  and the timing of intellectual property licenses that we may enter 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  fluctuations in quarterly results could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so 
for example  during fiscal year  the closing sale price of our stock ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to rise and fall 
these factors include variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations  clinical results  or new products by us or our competitors  introduction of new products or new pricing policies by us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or others in our industry  announcement by the government or other agencies regarding the economic health of the united states and the rest of the world  the hiring or departure of key personnel  changes in market valuations of companies within the biotechnology industry  and changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by financial analysts 
we have a large amount of debt and our debt service obligations may prevent us from taking actions that we would otherwise consider to be in our best interests 
as of march   we had total consolidated debt of million  and for the year ended december   we had a deficiency of earnings available to cover fixed charges of million 
a variety of uncertainties and contingencies will affect our future performance  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not generate sufficient cash flow in the future to enable us to meet our anticipated fixed charges  including our debt service requirements with respect to our notes that we sold in february and february at march   million of those notes remained outstanding 
the following table shows  as of march   the remaining aggregate amount of our interest payments due in each of the years listed in millions year aggregate interest thereafter our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences for our future operations  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  or placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
our debt investments are impacted by the financial viability of the underlying companies 
we have a diversified portfolio of investments of which million at december  were invested in us treasuries and debt investments that are sponsored by the us government 
our corporate fixed rate debt investments comply with our policy of investing in only investment grade debt instruments 
the ability for the debt to be repaid upon maturity or to have a viable resale market is dependent  in part  on the financial success of the underlying company 
should the underlying company suffer significant financial difficulty  the debt instrument could either be downgraded or  in the worst case  our investment could be worthless 
this would result in our losing the cash value of the investment and incurring a charge to our statement of operations 
we may need to raise additional funding  which may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we believe that we have sufficient capital to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twenty four months 
however  our future funding requirements will depend on many factors and we anticipate that  at some future point  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our business plan and research and development efforts on a going forward basis 
to the extent that we need to obtain additional funding  the amount of additional capital we would need to raise would depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and progress of our research  product development and clinical programs  our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations  the progress of our collaborators  our costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products 
we expect that we would raise any additional capital we require through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or additional collaborations and licensing arrangements 
we cannot be certain that in the future these sources of liquidity will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than anticipated 
in appropriate strategic situations  we may seek financial assistance from other sources  including contributions by others to joint ventures and other collaborative or licensing arrangements for the development and testing of products under development 
if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our shareholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates  or to grant licenses on unfavorable terms 
the relinquishing of rights or granting of licenses on unfavorable terms could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
however  should we be unable to obtain future financing either through the methods described above or through other means  we may be unable to meet the critical objective of our long term business plan  which is to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products 
if we require additional capital at a time when investment in biotechnology companies such as ours  or in the marketplace in general  is limited due to the then prevailing market or other conditions  we may not be able to raise such funds at the time that we desire or any time thereafter 
risks related to our convertible debt and our common stock into which our debt is convertible we have significant leverage as a result of the sales of our debt in and in february  in connection with the sale of our convertible subordinated debentures due in  we incurred million of indebtedness 
in february  we repurchased million of these debentures  for total consideration of million  plus accrued interest of million to the date of repurchase 
as a result of the remaining indebtedness of million  our interest payment obligations amount to million per year 
in february  in connection with the sale of our convertible subordinated notes due in  we incurred an additional million of indebtedness 
as a result of this indebtedness  our interest payment obligations amount to million per year 
the degree to which we are leveraged could adversely affect our ability to obtain further financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance  which may be subject to the financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these notes  due in and  are effectively subordinated to all of our secured indebtedness and all indebtedness of our subsidiaries 
these notes are our general unsecured obligations and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  these notes are effectively subordinated to all of our current and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the assets securing the indebtedness 
furthermore  our right to receive any distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon that subsidiary s liquidation  reorganization or otherwise  is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary  except to the extent we also are recognized as a creditor of that subsidiary 
as a result  these notes are effectively subordinated to the claims of such creditors 
there are no restrictive covenants in our indentures relating to our ability to incur future indebtedness 
the indentures governing our notes due in and do not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends  the incurrence of indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of liens or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries 
we may therefore incur additional debt  including secured indebtedness senior to these notes 
as part of our growth strategy  we potentially may use proceeds from the offering to finance future acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies  which may cause us or our subsidiaries to incur significant indebtedness to which these notes would be subordinate 
these notes are obligations exclusively of curagen corporation 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities 
our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on these notes or to provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans or other payments 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions  loans or advances by our subsidiaries to us could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future working capital  borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt  we may have to delay or curtail our research and development programs 
the level of our indebtedness among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our notes  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
our ability to repurchase notes  if required  with cash upon a change in control or fundamental change may be limited 
in certain circumstances involving a change in control  we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes due in certain circumstances involving a fundamental change  we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes due we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient financial resources at such time or would be able to arrange financing to pay the repurchase price of the notes 
our ability to repurchase the notes in such event may be limited by law  by the indenture and by such indebtedness and agreements as may be entered into  replaced  supplemented or amended from time to time 
securities we issue to fund our operations could cause dilution to our shareholders ownership 
the conversion of our notes into shares of common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our current shareholders 
we may decide to raise additional funds through a public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current shareholders  including the ownership that holders of the notes would have upon conversion  will be reduced  and the new equity securities may have rights prior to those of the common stock issuance upon conversion of the notes 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to existing shareholders and us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currently  we maintain approximately of our cash and investments in financial instruments with original maturity dates of less than three months  in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than three months and less than one year  and the remaining in financial instruments with original maturity dates of greater than one year and less than five years 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
we estimate that a change of basis points in interest rates would result in a million decrease or increase in the fair value of our cash and investments 
our outstanding long term liabilities as of december  consisted of our convertible subordinated debentures due february  and an accrued long term liability for the remaining future minimum payments under a license agreement see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as the debentures bear interest at a fixed rate  our results of operations would not be affected by interest rate changes 
although future borrowings may bear interest at a floating rate  and would therefore be affected by interest rate changes  at this point we do not anticipate any significant future borrowings except for the issuance on february  of million of convertible subordinated notes due  which is more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  and therefore do not believe that a change of basis points in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial condition 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
as of december   the market value of our million convertible subordinated debentures due  based on quoted market prices  was estimated at million
