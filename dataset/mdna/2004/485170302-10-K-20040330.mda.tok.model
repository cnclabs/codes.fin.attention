item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this form k is incorporated by reference in partial response to this item rail network owned network kcsr owns and operates approximately  miles of main and branch lines and  miles of other tracks in a ten state region that includes missouri  kansas  arkansas  oklahoma  mississippi  alabama  tennessee  louisiana  texas and illinois 
kcsr has the shortest north south rail route between kansas city and several key ports along the gulf of mexico in louisiana  mississippi and texas 
kcsr s rail route also serves the meridian speedway and the east west route linking kansas city with east st 
louis  illinois and springfield  illinois 
in addition  kcsr has limited haulage rights between springfield and chicago that allow for originating or terminating shipments on the rail lines of the former gateway western railway company gateway western 
these lines also provide access to east st 
louis and allow rail traffic to avoid the st 
louis  missouri terminal 
the geographic reach of kcsr enables service to a customer base that includes electric generating utilities  which use coal  and a wide range of companies in the chemical and petroleum  agricultural and mineral  paper and forest products  and automotive and intermodal markets 

table of contents eastern railroads and their customers can use the company s rail network to bypass the gateways at chicago  st 
louis  memphis  tennessee and new orleans by interchanging with kcsr at springfield and east st 
louis and at meridian and jackson  mississippi 
other railroads can also interconnect with the company s rail network via other gateways at kansas city  birmingham  alabama  shreveport and new orleans  louisiana  and dallas  beaumont and laredo  texas 
kcsr revenues and net income are dependent on providing reliable service to customers at competitive rates  the general economic conditions in the geographic region served and the ability to effectively compete against other rail carriers and alternative modes of surface transportation  such as over the road truck transportation 
the ability of kcsr to construct and maintain the roadway in order to provide safe and efficient transportation service is important to its ongoing viability as a rail carrier 
additionally  cost containment is important in maintaining a competitive market position  particularly with respect to employee costs  as approximately of kcsr employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements 
significant investments grupo tfm in december  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with transportacion maritima mexicana  sa de sa tmm to  among other things  provide for participation in the privatization of the mexican national railway system and to promote the movement of rail traffic over tex mex  tfm and kcsr 
pursuant to written notice given by tmm s successor  grupo tmm  sa  and in accordance with its terms  the joint venture agreement terminated on december  in  the company invested million to obtain a interest in grupo tfm  the company formed by kcs and tmm under the joint venture agreement for the purpose of participating in the privatization of the mexican national railway system 
at the time grupo tfm purchased of the shares of tfm  tmm  the largest shareholder of grupo tfm  owned of grupo tfm and the mexican government owned the remaining 
in  kcs and grupo tmm exercised their call option on the mexican government s grupo tfm shares and  on july   tfm completed the purchase of the mexican government s ownership of grupo tfm 
the million purchase price was funded utilizing a combination of proceeds from an offering of debt securities by tfm  a credit from the mexican government for the reversion of certain rail facilities and other resources 
this transaction increased the company s ownership percentage of grupo tfm from to approximately 
grupo tfm owns of the stock of tfm all of which shares are entitled to full voting rights while the remaining of tfm with limited voting rights is owned by the mexican government 
tfm holds the concession  which was awarded by the mexican government in  to operate mexico s northeast rail lines the concession  the northeast rail lines are now known as tfm for years ending in june subject to certain conditions  tfm has an option to extend the concession for an additional years 
the concession is subject to certain mandatory trackage rights and is exclusive until the mexican government  however  may revoke tfm s exclusivity after if it determines that there is insufficient competition and may terminate the concession as a result of certain conditions or events  including tfm s failure to meet its operating and financial obligations with regard to the concession under applicable mexican law  a statutory appropriation by the mexican government for reasons of public interest and liquidation or bankruptcy of tfm 
tfm s assets and its rights under the concession may  under certain circumstances such as natural disaster  war or other similar situations  also be seized temporarily by the mexican government 
under the concession  tfm operates a strategically significant corridor between mexico and the united states  and has as its core route a key portion of the shortest  most direct rail passageway between mexico city and laredo 
tfm s rail lines are the only ones which serve nuevo laredo  the largest rail freight exchange point between the united states and mexico 
tfm s rail lines connect the most populated and industrialized regions of mexico with mexico s principal us border railway gateway at laredo 
in addition  tfm serves three of mexico s primary seaports at veracruz and tampico on the gulf of mexico and lazaro cardenas on the pacific 
table of contents ocean 
tfm serves mexican states and mexico city  which together represent a majority of the country s population and account for a majority of its estimated gross domestic product 
kcs management believes the laredo gateway is the most important interchange point for rail freight between the united states and mexico 
as a result  kcs management believes that tfm s routes are an integral part of mexico s foreign trade infrastructure 
this route structure enables the company to benefit from growing trade resulting from the increasing integration of the north american economy through nafta 
through tex mex and kcsr  as well as through interchanges with other major us railroads  tfm provides its customers with access to an extensive rail network through which they may distribute their products throughout north america and overseas 
tfm operates approximately  miles of main and branch lines and certain additional sidings  spur tracks and main line tracks under trackage rights 
tfm has the right to operate the rail lines through the concession  but does not own the land  roadway or associated structures 
tfm  including its indirect ownership of tex mex  is both a strategic and financial investment for kcs 
strategically  the company s investment in tfm promotes the nafta growth strategy  whereby kcs and its strategic partners can provide transportation services between the heart of mexico s industrial base  the united states and canada 
tfm seeks to establish its railroad as the primary inland freight transporter linking mexico with the us and canadian markets along the nafta corridor 
tfm s strategy is to provide reliable customer service  capitalize on foreign trade growth and convert truck tonnage to rail 
kcs management believes tfm is an excellent long term financial investment 
tfm s operating strategy has been to increase productivity and maximize operating efficiencies 
with mexico s economic progress  growth of nafta trade between mexico  the united states and canada  and customer focused rail service  kcs management believes that the growth potential of tfm could be significant 
as further described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments proposed acquisition of grupo tfm from grupo tmm  on april   the company entered into an agreement with grupo tmm and other parties acquisition agreement under which kcs ultimately would acquire control of tfm through the purchase of shares of common stock of grupo tfm acquisition 
the obligations of kcs and grupo tmm to complete the acquisition are subject to a number of conditions 
grupo tmm and kcs are currently in dispute over grupo tmm s attempt to terminate the acquisition agreement 
this dispute could adversely affect tfm s operations and business 
on january   moody s investors service  or moody s  announced that it had placed the b senior unsecured debt rating of tfm under review for possible downgrade 
moody s announced that  as part of the current review  it will consider the implications of these issues the grupo tmm kcs dispute  the value and rights for the vat reimbursement  and the obligations under the mexican government s put of tfm shares 
on february   grupo tmm announced that during the fourth quarter of  tfm failed to meet certain financial covenant ratios under its term loan facility and its commercial paper program 
the press release stated that tfm was negotiating with its lenders on amendments to these credit agreements  which would retroactively amend the covenants and would effectively cure the defaults  and that tfm is also in the process of refinancing its commercial paper program to extend the maturity date to on march   grupo tfm announced that effective march   it had received a waiver from the banks that participate in the term loan facility and commercial paper program and that it was waived from the financial covenants for the three months ended december  and for the period from january  through may  the mexican government has the right to compel the purchase of its interest in tfm referred to as the put by grupo tfm following notification by the mexican government in accordance with the terms of the 
table of contents applicable agreements 
upon exercise of the put  grupo tfm would be obligated to purchase the tfm capital stock at the initial share price paid by grupo tfm adjusted for interest and inflation 
prior to october   grupo tfm filed suit in the federal district court of mexico city seeking  among other things  a declaratory judgment interpreting whether grupo tfm was obligated to honor its obligation under the put agreement  as the mexican government had not made any effort to sell the tfm shares subject to the put prior to october  in its suit  grupo tfm named grupo tmm and kcs as additional interested parties 
the mexican court has admitted grupo tfm s complaint and issued an injunction that would  following the posting of a bond by grupo tfm  block the mexican government from exercising the put 
the mexican government provided grupo tfm with notice of its intention to sell its interest in tfm on october  grupo tfm has responded to the mexican government s notice reaffirming its right and interest in purchasing the mexican government s remaining interest in tfm  but also advising the mexican government that it would not take any action until its lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment was resolved 
in the event that grupo tfm does not purchase the mexican government s interest in tfm  grupo tmm and kcs  or either of grupo tmm or kcs alone  would  following notification by the mexican government in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreements  be obligated to purchase the mexican government s remaining interest in tfm 
as this matter is currently the subject of litigation in mexico to which the mexican government  grupo tfm  grupo tmm and kcs are parties  kcs management does not believe it is likely that the mexican government will seek to exercise the put until the litigation is resolved 
based upon public disclosures made by grupo tmm  it is not in a position to make this purchase 
following the resolution of the lawsuit in mexico  should grupo tfm fail to purchase the mexican government s tfm shares in accordance with the terms of the put  then the mexican government has the right to put all the shares of tfm to kcs 
in such an event  kcs would have the right  but not the obligation  to put of the shares purchased by kcs to grupo tmm 
however  there can be no assurance that grupo tmm would have the financial resources necessary to purchase those shares 
if the acquisition is completed  kcs will be solely responsible for purchasing the mexican government s interest in tfm 
if kcs had been required to purchase this interest as of december   the total purchase price would have been approximately million 
the original term of the grupo tfm joint venture agreement was renewed for a term of three years on december  pursuant to written notice given by grupo tmm  and in accordance with its terms  the joint venture agreement terminated on december  the joint venture did not have any material assets and management believes that the termination of the joint venture agreement will not have a material adverse effect on the company or its interest in grupo tfm 
the shareholders agreement dated may between kcs and grupo tmm and certain affiliates  which governs the company s investment in grupo tfm restricts each of the parties to the shareholders agreement from directly or indirectly transferring any interest in grupo tfm or tfm to a competitor of grupo tfm  tfm or the parties without the prior written consent of each of the parties  and provides that kcs and grupo tmm may not transfer control of any subsidiary holding all or any portion of shares of grupo tfm to a third party  other than an affiliate of the transferring party or another party to the shareholders agreement  without the consent of the other parties to the shareholders agreement 
the grupo tfm bylaws prohibit any transfer of shares of grupo tfm to any person other than an affiliate of the existing shareholders without the prior consent of grupo tfm s board of directors 
in addition  the grupo tfm bylaws grant the shareholders of grupo tfm a right of first refusal to acquire shares to be transferred by any other shareholder in proportion to the number of shares held by each non transferring shareholder  although holders of preferred shares or shares with special or limited rights are only entitled to acquire those shares and not ordinary shares 
the shareholders agreement requires that the boards of directors of grupo tfm and tfm be constituted to reflect the parties relative ownership of the ordinary voting common stock of grupo tfm 
tex mex on february   the company  grupo tmm  and certain of grupo tmm s affiliates entered into a stock purchase agreement with tfm to sell to tfm all of the common stock of mexrail 
the sale closed on march  and the company received approximately million for its interest in mexrail 
the 
table of contents company used the proceeds from the sale of mexrail to reduce debt 
although the company no longer directly owns of mexrail  it retains an indirect ownership through its ownership of grupo tfm 
under the stock purchase agreement  kcs retained rights to prevent further sale or transfer of the stock or significant assets of mexrail and tex mex and the right to continue to participate in the corporate governance of mexrail and tex mex  which will remain us corporations and subject to the company s super majority rights contained in grupo tfm s bylaws 
tex mex connects to kcsr through trackage rights over the rail lines of the union pacific railroad company up between robstown  texas and beaumont 
these trackage rights were granted pursuant to a surface transportation board stb decision and have an initial term of years 
tex mex provides a vital link between the company s us operations through kcsr and its mexican operations through tfm 
on march   tex mex purchased from up a line of railroad right of way extending miles between rosenberg  texas and victoria  texas  and granted tex mex trackage rights sufficient to integrate the line into the existing trackage rights 
the line is not in service and will require extensive reconstruction  which has not yet been scheduled 
the purchase price for the line of million was determined through arbitration and the acquisition also required the prior approval or exemption of the transaction by the stb 
by its order entered on december   the stb granted tex mex s petition for exemption and exempted the transaction from this prior approval requirement 
once reconstruction of the line is completed  tex mex will be able to shorten its existing route between corpus christi and houston  texas by over miles 
panama canal railway company in january  the republic of panama awarded pcrc  a joint venture company formed by kcsr and mi jack products  inc mi jack  the concession to reconstruct and operate the panama canal railway  a mile railroad located adjacent to the panama canal that provides international shippers with a railway transportation option to complement the panama canal 
the panama canal railway  which traces its origins back to the mid s  is a north south railroad traversing the panama isthmus between the pacific and atlantic oceans 
the railroad has been reconstructed and it resumed freight operations in december kcs management believes the prime potential and opportunity for this railroad to be in the movement of container traffic between the ports of balboa and colon for shipping customers repositioning such containers 
the panama canal railway has significant interest from both shipping companies and port terminal operators 
in addition  there is demand for passenger traffic for both commuter and pleasure tourist travel 
panarail operates and promotes commuter and tourist passenger service over the panama canal railway 
passenger service started during july while only miles long  kcs management believes the panama canal railway provides the company with a unique opportunity to participate in transoceanic shipments as a complement to the existing panama canal traffic 
as of december   the company has invested approximately million toward the reconstruction and operations of the panama canal railway 
this investment is comprised of million of equity and million of subordinated loans 
these loans carry a interest rate and are payable on demand  subject to certain restrictions 
in november  pcrc completed the financing for the reconstruction project with the international finance corporation ifc  a member of the world bank group 
the financing was comprised of a million investment by the ifc and senior loans through the ifc in an aggregate amount of up to million 
additionally  pcrc has million of equipment loans and other capital leases totaling million 
the ifc s investment of million in pcrc is comprised of non voting preferred shares which pay a cumulative dividend 
as of december   pcrc has recorded a million liability for these cumulative preferred dividends 
the preferred shares may be redeemed at the ifc s option any year after at the lower of a net 
table of contents cumulative internal rate of return of or eight times earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization for the two years preceding the redemption that is proportionate to the ifc s percentage ownership in pcrc 
under the terms of the loan agreement with ifc  the company is a guarantor for up to million of the associated debt 
also if pcrc terminates the concession contract without the ifc s consent  the company is a guarantor for up to of the outstanding senior loans 
the company is also a guarantor for up to million of the equipment loans and approximately  relating to other capital leases 
the cost of the reconstruction totaled approximately million 
the company expects to loan an additional million to pcrc during under the same terms as the existing million subordinated loans 
southern capital in  kcsr and gatx capital corporation gatx formed a joint venture southern capital to perform certain leasing and financing activities 
southern capital s operations are comprised of the acquisition of locomotives  rolling stock and other rail equipment and the leasing thereof to kcsr 
concurrent with the formation of this joint venture  kcsr entered into operating leases with southern capital for substantially all the locomotives and rolling stock that kcsr contributed or sold to southern capital at the time of formation of the joint venture 
gatx contributed cash in the joint venture transaction formation 
the purpose for the formation of southern capital was to partner a class i railroad in kcsr with an industry leader in the rail equipment financing in gatx 
southern capital provides the company with access to equipment financing alternatives 
expanded network through its strategic alliance with cn ic and marketing agreements with norfolk southern  bnsf and the ic e  the company has expanded the domestic geographic reach beyond that covered by its owned network 
strategic alliance with canadian national and illinois central 
in  kcsr  cn and ic entered into a year strategic alliance to coordinate the marketing  operations and investment elements of north south rail freight transportation 
the strategic alliance did not require stb approval and was effective immediately 
this alliance connects canadian markets  the major midwest us markets of detroit  michigan  chicago  kansas city and st 
louis and the key southern markets of memphis  dallas and houston 
it also provides us and canadian shippers with access to mexico s rail system through connections with tex mex and tfm 
in addition to providing access to key north south international and domestic us traffic corridors  the alliance with cn ic is intended to increase business primarily in the automotive and intermodal markets  the grain market  the chemical and petroleum market and the paper and forest products markets 
this alliance has provided opportunities for revenue growth and positioned the company as a key provider of rail service for nafta trade 
kcsr and cn formed a management group made up of senior management representatives from both railroads to  among other things  guide the realization of the alliance goals  and to develop plans for the construction of new facilities to support business development  including investments in automotive  intermodal and transload facilities at memphis  dallas  kansas city and chicago 
under a separate agreement  kcsr was granted certain trackage and haulage rights and cn and ic were granted certain haulage rights 
under the terms of this agreement  and through action taken by the stb  in kcsr gained access to six additional chemical customers in the geismar  louisiana industrial area through haulage rights 

table of contents marketing agreements with norfolk southern 
in december  kcsr entered into a three year marketing agreement with norfolk southern and tex mex that allows kcsr to increase its traffic volume along the east west corridor between meridian and dallas by using interchange points with norfolk southern 
this agreement provides norfolk southern run through service with access to dallas and the mexican border at laredo while avoiding the rail gateways of memphis and new orleans 
this agreement was renewed in december for a term of three years and will be automatically renewed for additional three year terms unless written notice of termination is given at least days prior to the expiration of the then current term 
in may  kcsr entered into an additional marketing agreement with norfolk southern under which kcsr provides haulage services for intermodal traffic between meridian and dallas in exchange for fees from norfolk southern 
under this agreement norfolk southern may quote rates and enter into transportation service contracts with shippers and receivers covering this haulage traffic 
this agreement terminates on december  and provides kcsr with additional sources of intermodal business 
under the current arrangement  trains run between kcsr s connection with norfolk southern at meridian and the bnsf connection at dallas 
the structure of the agreement provides for lower gross revenue to kcsr  but improved operating income since  as a haulage arrangement  locomotives  locomotive fuel and car hire expenses are the responsibility of norfolk southern  not kcsr 
management believes this business has additional growth potential as norfolk southern may seek to shift its traffic to southern gateways to increase its length of haul 
marketing alliance with bnsf in april  kcsr and bnsf formed a comprehensive joint marketing alliance aimed at promoting cooperation  revenue growth and extending market reach for both railroads in the united states and canada 
the marketing alliance was also designed to improve operating efficiencies for both carriers in key market areas  as well as provide customers with expanded service options 
kcsr and bnsf have agreed to coordinate marketing and operational initiatives in a number of target markets 
the marketing alliance allows the two railroads to be more responsive to shippers requests for rates and service throughout the two rail networks 
coal and unit train operations are excluded from the marketing alliance  as well as any points where kcsr and bnsf are the only direct rail competitors 
movements to and from mexico by either party are also excluded 
management believes this marketing alliance provides important opportunities to grow kcsr s revenue base  particularly in the chemical  grain and forest product markets  and provides participants with expanded access to important markets and shippers with enhanced options and competitive alternatives 
marketing agreement with ic e 
in may  kcsr entered into a marketing agreement with i m rail link  now known as ic e 
this marketing agreement provides kcsr with access to minneapolis and chicago and to the origination of corn and other grain traffic in iowa  minnesota and illinois 
through this marketing agreement  kcsr receives and originates shipments of grain products for delivery to poultry industry feed mills on its network 
grain is currently kcsr s largest export into mexico 
this agreement is terminable upon days notice 
management believes this agreement provides ic e with an important channel of distribution over our rail network versus other railroads 
haulage rights 
as a result of the acquisition of the missouri kansas texas railroad by up  kcsr was granted haulage rights between kansas city and each of council bluffs  iowa  omaha and lincoln  nebraska and atchison and topeka  kansas  and a joint rate agreement for our grain traffic between beaumont and each of houston and galveston  texas 
kcsr has the right to convert these haulage rights to trackage rights 
kcsr s haulage rights require up to move kcsr traffic in up trains  trackage rights would allow kcsr to operate its trains over up tracks 
these rights have a term of years 
in addition  kcsr has limited haulage rights between springfield and chicago that allow for shipments that originate or terminate on the former gateway western s rail lines 

table of contents markets served chemical and petroleum chemical and petroleum products accounted for approximately of kcsr revenues in kcsr transports chemical and petroleum products via tank and hopper cars primarily to markets in the southeast and northeast united states through interchanges with other rail carriers 
primary traffic includes plastics  petroleum and oils  petroleum coke  rubber  and miscellaneous chemicals 
kcsr s access to six additional chemical customers in the geismar  louisiana industrial corridor has resulted in additional revenue for kcsr and management believes it could provide future competitive opportunities for revenue growth as existing contracts with other rail carriers expire for these customers 
paper and forest products paper and forest products accounted for approximately of kcsr revenues 
the company s rail lines run through the heart of the southeastern us timber producing region 
management believes that forest products made from trees in this region are generally less expensive than those from other regions due to lower production costs 
as a result  southern yellow pine products from the southeast are increasingly being used at the expense of western producers who have experienced capacity reductions because of public policy considerations 
kcsr serves eleven paper mills directly and six others indirectly through short line connections 
primary traffic includes pulp and paper  lumber  panel products plywood and oriented strand board  engineered wood products  pulpwood  woodchips  raw fiber used in the production of paper  pulp and paperboard  as well as metal  scrap and slab steel  waste and military equipment 
slab steel products are used primarily in the manufacture of drill pipe for the oil industry  and military equipment is shipped to and from several military bases on the company s rail lines 
agricultural and mineral agricultural and mineral products accounted for approximately of kcsr revenues in agricultural products consist of domestic and export grain  food and related products 
shipper demand for agricultural products is affected by competition among sources of grain and grain products as well as price fluctuations in international markets for key commodities 
in the domestic grain business  the company s rail lines receive and originate shipments of grain and grain products for delivery to feed mills serving the poultry industry 
through the marketing agreement with ic e  the company s rail lines have access to sources of corn and other grain in iowa and other midwestern states 
kcsr currently serves feed mills along its rail lines throughout arkansas  oklahoma  texas  louisiana  mississippi and alabama 
export grain shipments include primarily wheat  soybeans and corn transported to the gulf of mexico for overseas destinations and to mexico via laredo 
over the long term  grain shipments are expected to increase as a result of the company s strategic investments in tex mex and tfm  given mexico s reliance on grain imports 
food and related products consist mainly of soybean meal  grain meal  oils and canned goods  sugar and beer 
mineral shipments consist of a variety of products including ores  clay  stone and cement 
intermodal and automotive intermodal and automotive products accounted for approximately of kcsr revenues 
the intermodal freight business consists primarily of hauling freight containers or truck trailers by a combination of water  rail and motor carriers  with rail carriers serving as the link between the other modes of transportation 
the company s intermodal business has grown significantly over the last ten years with intermodal units increasing from  in to  in and intermodal revenues increasing from million to million during the same period 
through our dedicated intermodal train service between meridian and dallas  the company competes directly with truck carriers along the interstate corridor 
the intermodal business is highly price and service driven as the trucking industry maintains certain competitive advantages over the rail industry 
trucks are not obligated to provide or maintain rights of way and do not have to pay real estate taxes on their routes 
in prior years  the trucking industry diverted a substantial 
table of contents amount of freight from railroads as truck operators efficiency over long distances increased 
in response to these competitive pressures  railroad industry management sought avenues to improve the competitiveness of rail traffic and forged numerous alliances with truck companies in order to move more traffic by rail and provide faster  safer and more efficient service to their customers 
kcsr has entered into agreements with several trucking companies for train service in several corridors  but those services are concentrated between dallas and meridian 
the strategic alliance with cn ic and marketing agreements with norfolk southern provide the company the opportunity to further capitalize on the growth potential of intermodal freight revenues  particularly for traffic moving between points in the upper midwest and canada to kansas city  dallas and mexico 
furthermore  the company is developing the former richards gebaur airbase in kansas city as a us customs pre clearance processing facility  the kansas city international freight gateway ifg  which  when at full capacity  is expected to handle and process large volumes of domestic and international intermodal freight 
through an agreement with mazda through the ford motor company s claycomo manufacturing facility located in kansas city  kcsr has developed an automotive loading and distribution facility at ifg 
this loading and distribution facility became operational in april for the movement of mazda vehicles 
during  the ifg served ford through the loading and delivery of its new f truck 
management believes that  as additional opportunities arise  the ifg facility will be expanded to include additional automotive and intermodal operations 
the company s automotive traffic consists primarily of vehicle parts moving into mexico from the northern sections of the united states and finished vehicles moving from mexico into the united states 
cn ic  norfolk southern and tfm have a number of automotive production facilities on their rail lines 
the company s rail network essentially serves as the connecting bridge carrier for these movements of automotive parts and finished vehicles 
coal coal historically has been one of the most stable sources of revenues and is the largest single commodity handled by kcsr 
in  coal revenues represented of total kcsr revenues 
substantially all coal customers are under long term contracts  which typically have an average contract term of approximately five years 
kcsr s most significant customer is southwestern electric power company swepco a subsidiary of american electric power  inc  which is under contract through the company  directly or indirectly  delivers coal to eight electric generating plants  including the flint creek  arkansas and welsh  texas facilities of swepco  kansas city power and light plants in kansas city and amsterdam  missouri  an empire district electric company plant near joplin  missouri and an entergy gulf states plant in mossville  louisiana 
kcsr transports coal that originates in the powder river basin in wyoming and is transferred to kcsr s rail lines at kansas city 
kcsr serves as a bridge carrier for coal deliveries to a texas utilities electric generating plant in martin lake  texas 
in addition  kcsr delivers lignite to an electric generating plant at monticello  texas 
swepco comprised approximately of kcsr total coal revenues and of kcs consolidated revenues in other other rail related revenues include a variety of miscellaneous services provided to customers and interconnecting carriers and accounted for approximately of total kcsr revenues in major items in this category include railcar switching services  demurrage car retention penalties and drayage local truck transportation services 
this category also includes haulage services performed for the benefit of bnsf under an agreement that continues through and includes minimum volume commitments 
railroad industry overview us railroad companies are categorized by the stb into three types class i  class ii regional and class iii local 
currently  there are seven class i railroads in the united states  which can be further divided 
table of contents geographically by eastern or western classification 
the eastern railroads are csx corporation csx  grand trunk corporation which is owned by cn and includes ic and wisconsin central transportation corporation wisconsin central and norfolk southern 
the western railroads include bnsf  kcsr  soo line railroad company owned by canadian pacific railway company cp and up 
the stb and regulation the stb  an independent body administratively housed within the department of transportation  is responsible for the economic regulation of railroads within the united states 
the stb s mission is to ensure that competitive  efficient and safe transportation services are provided to meet the needs of shippers  receivers and consumers 
the stb was created by an act of congress known as the icc termination act of iccta 
passage of the iccta represented a further step in the process of streamlining and reforming the federal economic regulatory oversight of the railroad  trucking and bus industries that was initiated in the late s and early s 
the stb is authorized to have three members  each with a five year term of office 
the stb chairman is designated by the president of the united states from among the stb s members 
the stb adjudicates disputes and regulates interstate surface transportation 
railway transportation matters under the stb s jurisdiction in general include railroad rate and service issues  rail restructuring transactions mergers  line sales  line construction and line abandonment and railroad labor matters 
the us railroad industry was significantly deregulated with the passage of the staggers rail act of the staggers act 
in enacting the staggers act  congress recognized that railroads faced intense competition from trucks and other modes of transportation for most freight traffic and that prevailing regulation prevented them from earning adequate revenues and competing effectively 
through the staggers act  a new regulatory scheme allowing railroads to establish their own routes  tailor their rates to market conditions and differentiate rates on the basis of demand was put in place 
the basic principle of the staggers act was that reasonable rail rates should be a function of supply and demand 
the staggers act  among others things allows railroads to price competing routes and services differently to reflect relative demand  allows railroads to enter into confidential rate and service contracts with shippers  and abolishes collective rate making except among railroads participating in a joint line movement 
if it is determined that a railroad is not facing enough competition to hold down prices  the stb has the authority to investigate the actions of the railroad 
the staggers act has had a positive effect on the us rail industry  competition  and savings to consumers 
lower rail rates brought about by the staggers act have resulted in significant cost savings for shippers and their customers 
after decades of steady decline  the rail market share of inter city freight ton miles bottomed out at in and has trended slowly upward since then  reaching in railroad consolidation on june   the stb issued new rules governing major railroad mergers and consolidations involving two or more class i railroads 
these rules substantially increase the burden on rail merger applicants to demonstrate that a proposed transaction would be in the public interest 
the rules require applicants to demonstrate that  among other things  a proposed transaction would enhance competition where necessary to offset negative effects of the transaction  such as competitive harm  and to address fully the impact of the transaction on transportation service 
the stb recognized  however  that a merger between kcsr and another class i carrier would not necessarily raise the same concerns and risks as potential mergers between larger class i railroads 
accordingly  the stb decided that for a merger proposal involving kcsr and another class i railroad  the stb will waive the application of the new rules and apply the rules previously in effect unless it is persuaded that the new rules should apply 

table of contents competition the company s rail operations compete against other railroads  many of which are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources 
since  there has been significant consolidation among major north american rail carriers  including the merger of burlington northern  inc and santa fe pacific corporation bn sf  collectively bnsf  the merger of the up and the chicago and north western transportation company up cnw and the merger of up with southern pacific corporation up sp 
further  norfolk southern and csx purchased the assets of consolidated rail corporation conrail in and the cn acquired the ic in june most recently  in october cn completed its acquisition of wisconsin central 
as a result of this consolidation  the railroad industry is now dominated by a few mega carriers 
kcs management believes that its revenues were negatively affected by the up cnw  up sp and bn sf mergers  which led to diversions of rail traffic away from kcsr s rail lines 
management regards the larger western railroads bnsf and up  in particular  as significant competitors to the company s operations and prospects because of their substantial resources 
the ongoing impact of these mergers is uncertain 
kcs management believes  however  that because of the company s investments and strategic alliances  it is positioned to attract additional rail traffic through our nafta rail network 
the company is subject to competition from motor carriers  barge lines  and other maritime shipping  which compete across certain routes in its operating area 
truck carriers have eroded the railroad industry s share of total transportation revenues 
changing regulations  subsidized highway improvement programs and favorable labor regulations have improved the competitive position of trucks in the united states as an alternative mode of surface transportation for many commodities 
in the united states  the trucking industry generally is more cost and transit time competitive than railroads for short haul distances 
in addition  mississippi and missouri river barge traffic  among others  compete with kcsr and its rail connections in the transportation of bulk commodities such as grains  steel and petroleum products 
intermodal traffic and certain other traffic face highly price sensitive competition  particularly from motor carriers 
however  rail carriers  including kcsr  have placed an emphasis on competing in the intermodal marketplace and working together with motor carriers and each other to provide end to end transportation of products 
while deregulation of freight rates has enhanced the ability of railroads to compete with each other and with alternative modes of transportation  this increased competition has resulted in downward pressure on freight rates 
competition with other railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based on the rates charged  the quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality of the carrier s equipment for certain commodities 
employees and labor relations as of december   kcs and its subsidiaries had approximately  employees 
labor relations in the us railroad industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation under the railway labor act rla 
under the rla  national labor agreements are renegotiated when they become open for modification  but their terms remain in effect until new agreements are reached 
typically  neither management nor labor employees are permitted to take economic action until extended procedures are exhausted 
approximately of kcsr employees are covered under various collective bargaining agreements 
in  national labor contracts governing kcsr were negotiated with all major railroad unions  including the united transportation union utu  the brotherhood of locomotive engineers ble  the transportation communications international union tcu  the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees bmwe  and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
existing national union contracts with the railroads became amendable at the end of in august  a new labor contract was reached with the utu 
the provisions of this agreement include the use of remote control locomotives in and around terminals and retroactive application of wage increases back to july  also  a new labor contract was reached with 
table of contents the tcu in and signed during a new labor contract was reached with the bmwe effective may and a formal agreement with the ble was reached during in some cases  the wage increase elements of these new agreements have retroactive application 
the provisions of the various labor agreements generally include periodic general wage increases  lump sum payments to workers and greater work rule flexibility  among other provisions 
additionally  these agreements include provisions that employees under these contracts make contributions to cover a portion of the health and welfare costs 
currently  approximately of all kcs unionized employees are governed under current contracts 
formal negotiations to enter into agreements are in progress with the remaining unions and the existing labor contracts will remain in effect until new agreements are reached 
management does not expect that the negotiations or the resulting labor agreements will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
railroad retirement act and railroad retirement improvement act railroad industry personnel are covered by the railroad retirement act rra instead of the social security act 
employer contributions under the rra are currently substantially higher than those under the social security act and may rise further because of the increasing proportion of retired employees receiving benefits relative to the number of working employees 
the rra currently requires up to a contribution by railroad employers on eligible wages while the social security and medicare acts only require a employer contribution on similar wage bases 
railroad industry personnel are also covered by the federal employers liability act fela rather than state workers compensation systems 
fela is a fault based system with compensation for injuries settled by negotiation and litigation  which can be expensive and time consuming 
by contrast  most other industries are covered by state administered no fault plans with standard compensation schedules 
the difference in the labor regulations for the rail industry compared to the non rail industries illustrates the competitive disadvantage placed upon the rail industry by federal labor regulations 
on december   the railroad retirement and survivors improvement act of rria was signed into law 
this legislation liberalizes early retirement benefits for employees with years of service by reducing the full benefit age from to  eliminates a cap on monthly retirement and disability benefits  lowers the minimum service requirement from years to years of service  and provides for increased benefits for surviving spouses 
it also provides for the investment of railroad retirement funds in non governmental assets  adjustments in the payroll tax rates paid by employees and employers  and the repeal of a supplemental annuity work hour tax 
the law also reduced the employer contribution for payroll taxes by in and by an additional in beginning in  the employer contribution will be based on a formula and could range between and 
these reductions in the employer contributions under the rra had a favorable impact on fringe benefits expenses during additionally  the reduction in the retirement age from to is expected to result in increased employee attrition  leading to additional potential cost savings since it is not anticipated that all employees selecting early retirement will be replaced
