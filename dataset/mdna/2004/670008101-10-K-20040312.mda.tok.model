item business novellus systems  inc  a california corporation organized in  develops  manufactures  sells and supports systems used in the fabrication of integrated circuits 
the customers for these products are manufacturers of semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  who either incorporate the chips they manufacture in their own products or sell them to other companies for use in electronic products 
integrated circuits are generally built on a silicon wafer base and include a large number of different components  such as transistors  capacitors and other electronic devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring  or interconnects 
to build an integrated circuit  transistors are first created on the surface of the silicon wafer 
the wiring and insulating structures are then added as multiple thin film layers through a series of manufacturing process steps 
typically  a first layer of dielectric insulating material is deposited on top of the formed transistors 
subsequent layers of metal historically  aluminum are formed on top of this base layer  etched to create the conductive lines that carry the electricity  and then filled with dielectric material to create the necessary insulators between the lines  in a manufacturing process called subtractive aluminum 
when copper wires are being constructed  the manufacturing process  called copper damascene  is a mirror image of that described above the insulator dielectric is etched  and the copper wiring is created in the etched insulator via a high technology electroplating process called electrochemical deposition 
building either copper or aluminum wiring requires these manufacturing steps to be repeated many times  advanced chip designs may require as many as process steps 
novellus has historically focused on a single segment of the chipmaking process  the deposition of conducting and insulating material films 
novellus advanced deposition systems use chemical vapor deposition cvd  physical vapor deposition pvd  and electrochemical deposition ecd processes to form the interconnects in the device structure 
our high density plasma cvd hdp and plasma enhanced cvd pecvd systems employ a chemical plasma to deposit all of the dielectric or insulating layers and some of the metal or conductive layers on the surface of a semiconductor wafer 
our pvd systems use direct current power to deposit conductive metal layers by sputtering metallic atoms from the surface of a target source 
our electrofill ecd systems are used for depositing conductive layers of copper on wafers in a damascene manufacturing process 

table of contents in  novellus expanded beyond deposition technologies into the area of wafer surface preparation when we acquired gasonics international corporation  a manufacturer of systems used to clean and prepare a wafer surface after the manufacturing steps that precede deposition 
we also acquired speedfam ipec  inc  a manufacturer of chemical mechanical planarization cmp products in as the semiconductor industry migrates to the use of copper and low k low capacitance dielectrics in semiconductors  the manufacturing steps for surface preparation and cmp are becoming increasingly important

industry background over the past twenty years  the semiconductor industry has grown rapidly as a result of increasing demand for personal computers  the expansion of the internet and the telecommunications industry  and the emergence of new applications in consumer electronics 
more recently  growth has slowed  and there are signs that the industry may be beginning to mature 
while unit demand for semiconductor devices continues to rise  the average selling prices of chips continue to decline 
there is growing pressure on chipmakers to reduce manufacturing costs while simultaneously increasing the value of their products 
the semiconductor industry has also been historically cyclical  with periods of rapid expansion followed by periods of over capacity 
several technological trends characterize semiconductor manufacturing 
perhaps the most prominent of these trends is increasing density 
moore s law  first postulated in the mid s and still substantially accurate almost years later  states that the density of circuitry on an individual semiconductor chip doubles every months 
today s advanced devices are being manufactured with line widths as small as microns  or nanometers  and with up to ten layers of interconnect circuitry 
by increasing circuit density  manufacturers can pack more electronic components on a chip and thereby provide higher performance and value 
another trend worth noting is the transition to copper wiring from aluminum wiring as the primary conductive material in semiconductor devices 
copper has a lower electrical resistance value than aluminum  and this provides a number of performance advantages 
because of the superior properties of copper  a chip made with copper may need only half as many metal layers as one made with aluminum  providing considerable reduction in manufacturing cost 
in addition  copper wiring produces a substantial improvement in device performance and a significant reduction in power requirements compared to aluminum 
a similar transition is underway from traditional silicon oxide films to dielectric insulators with a low dielectric constant  or low k 
low k dielectrics are better at limiting the capacitance between metal lines in a device  which improves the speed and performance of the chip 
however  low k materials are also less stable than silicon oxide  and this poses a host of new challenges to the semiconductor industry in pursuing its goals of increased circuit density and  at the same time  lower manufacturing costs and elevated product performance and value 
another important trend is the move to larger wafer sizes 
chipmakers are now migrating to larger  mm wafers because of the potential manufacturing cost advantages of these larger wafers compared to mm 
the mm wafers provide up to times the number of chips per wafer  and hence may provide significant economies of scale in the manufacturing process 
these trends shape the equipment and process demands of our customers 
our customers generally measure the cost and performance of their production equipment in terms of cost per wafer  a ratio 
table of contents determined by factoring in the costs for acquisition and installation of a system  operating costs  and net throughput rate 
a system with higher net throughput allows a manufacturer to recover the purchase price over a greater number of wafers  thereby reducing the cost of ownership of the system on a per wafer basis 
yield and film qualities are also significant factors in selecting processing equipment 
the increased cost of larger and more complex semiconductor wafers have made high yields extremely important to our customers 
to achieve elevated yields and better film quality  systems must be able to repeat a process consistently and reliably 
this characteristic  known as repeatability  is critical in achieving commercially acceptable yields 
systems that operate at desired throughput rates without approaching critical tolerance limits can achieve repeatability more easily 
strategy our business objective is to use our core expertise to increase our market share in interconnect manufacturing  and strengthen our position as a leading supplier of semiconductor processing equipment 
the following are the key elements of our strategy emphasize high productivity systems we established our current position in the industry by emphasizing high productivity as the principal benefit that our products and technologies deliver to customers 
our unique multi chamber system for continuous pecvd processing illustrates our commitment to productivity 
this multi chamber design enables our pecvd systems to attain very high levels of wafer throughput  yield and film quality 
the simple architecture of our systems also takes up less space in the fabrication facility fab and requires less downtime than other system designs 
we intend to retain our historical focus on productivity by applying our multi chamber and continuous processing architecture in product enhancements and new product offerings 
focus on reducing customer costs cost is an important component when measuring overall productivity 
to that end  we strive to provide products and technologies that reduce our customers overall cost of ownership by offering chipmakers a number of process improvements and process differentiators  as well as by providing highly reliable systems that require less servicing than competing alternatives in the market 
differentiate our service philosophy our philosophy is to develop reliable products that require less servicing than competing alternatives 
we strive to provide support that minimizes the downtime and service costs that our customers experience 
lead in our target markets our goal is to command a leadership position in each of our target market areas 
we aim to be a leading provider in each of the subsets that comprise the served available market for our deposition products hdp  cvd  pecvd  pvd and ecd 
as a result of our acquisition of gasonics and subsequent internal product development efforts  we are one of the leading providers of surface preparation products 
our acquisition of speedfam ipec has enabled us to enter a new market segment  cmp  and we are aggressively pursuing a leadership position in this market segment as well 
broaden our interconnect offerings as semiconductor manufacturing technology becomes more complex  the interconnect structures on a chip take on greater importance in the manufacturing process 
we believe that by expanding beyond our historical focus on deposition products  we can add value in related interconnect manufacturing process steps 
the acquisitions of gasonics and speedfam ipec are examples of this strategy in action 
focus on major semiconductor manufacturers in  we sold systems to each of the world s top semiconductor manufacturing equipment capital spenders 
our sales objective is to work closely with our customers as they expand existing facilities  retrofit older manufacturing plants with new equipment  and build new fabs 
we strive to build customer loyalty and achieve a high level of repeat business by offering high reliability products  comprehensive field support  and a responsive parts replacement and service program 
expand market presence in asia while we derive a significant percentage of net sales from asia  we believe that substantial additional growth potential exists in the region over the long term 
japan  taiwan and korea continue to represent a significant portion of the world s capacity for semiconductor manufacturing  and 
table of contents china is rapidly becoming a major manufacturing region for the industry 
our local presence in asia includes sales and support offices throughout japan 
in addition  we maintain four offices in korea  three in china  three in taiwan  and one each in malaysia  singapore and india 
leverage our low cost manufacturing structure we perform all system design  assembly and testing in house  and outsource the manufacture of major subassemblies 
this manufacturing strategy allows us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures and gives us the flexibility to increase capacity as needed 
outsourcing also allows us to focus on product differentiation through system design and quality control  and helps to ensure that our subsystems incorporate the latest third party technologies in robotics  gas panels and microcomputers 
we work closely with our suppliers to achieve mutual cost reduction through joint development projects 
products deposition technologies our historical strength is rooted in deposition products  where we have consistently maintained a leadership position in the industry 
we currently offer products that address the needs of manufacturers across a number of different deposition technologies cvd  pvd and ecd 
since the introduction of our concept one dielectric platform in  we have offered a range of processing systems for dielectric and metal deposition 
in  we introduced the concept two platform a modular  integrated production system capable of depositing both dielectric and conductive metal layers by combining one or more processing chambers with a common  automated wafer handler 
the concept two enabled chipmakers to increase production throughput and system capability by adding process modules  without having to replace existing equipment 
in  we introduced the concept three platform  which built on the foundation of concept two to offer greater throughput in mm wafer manufacturing applications 
cvd products in the cvd process  manufacturers place wafers in a reaction chamber  introduce a variety of pure and precisely metered gases into the chamber  and then add some form of energy to activate a chemical reaction that deposits a film on the wafer 
the cvd process is the traditional method used to deposit dielectric films on wafers 
manufacturers also use cvd to deposit conductive metal layers  particularly tungsten  as it is difficult to deposit such layers on devices with very small features when using conventional pvd or other deposition technologies 
hdp cvd products concept two speed introduced in  concept two speed was the semiconductor industry s first high density plasma system capable of high volume manufacturing 
today  concept two speed is one of the top two product offerings for the hdp cvd marketplace 
concept two speed is a single wafer processing system for mm substrates 
speed is designed primarily to deposit dielectric materials in an aluminum interconnect manufacturing process 
concept two speed may also be used to deposit pre metal layers in copper manufacturing processes 
concept three speed the concept three speed is designed to apply dielectric material in the mm wafer manufacturing processes 
because it is based on our production proven concept two product  concept three speed offers minimal risk to our customers in making the transition from mm to mm wafers 
w cvd products concept two altus in  we introduced the concept two altus  used to deposit the tungsten plugs and vias that connect aluminum interconnect lines in aluminum based chips 
the concept two altus combines the modular architecture of the concept two with an advanced tungsten cvd dual process 
table of contents chamber 
the system is ideal for meeting the requirements of high volume  automated mm wafer fabs producing semiconductor devices at micron and below 
concept three altus the concept three altus  introduced in  provides the same advantages to mm wafer tungsten deposition as its concept two altus predecessor delivers for mm wafer applications 
pecvd products concept two sequel express introduced in  the concept two sequel express is designed to deposit our coral family of low k dielectric films  as well as other advanced films required for manufacturing micron and smaller semiconductor devices 
with a throughput in excess of wafers per hour  concept two sequel express delivers up to percent higher capital productivity and percent lower cost of ownership than competing pecvd systems 
vector introduced in  vector is a pecvd system for depositing dielectric films on mm wafers 
vector delivers a fully integrated low k dielectric structure at micron and smaller design rules 
with approximately two thirds the footprint of the nearest competitor  and fewer critical subsystems  vector delivers twice the capital productivity of the nearest competitor 
pvd products pvd  also known as sputtering  is a process where ions of an inert gas such as argon are electrically accelerated in a high vacuum toward a target of pure metal  such as tantalum or copper 
upon impact  the argon ions sputter off the target material  which is then deposited as a thin film on the silicon wafer 
pvd processes are used to create the barrier and seed layers in copper damascene interconnect applications 
we entered the pvd marketplace with the acquisition of varian associates thin film systems division in inova the inova mm system was introduced in with a multi chamber  single wafer processing design 
the inova s hollow cathode magnetron hcm ionized pvd source continues to gain market acceptance based on its superior barrier seed step coverage 
inova xt in  we introduced the mm inova xt  which features hcm technology 
the inova xt continues to offer superior barrier performance which leads to low via resistance and improved device reliability 
electrofill products our electrofill products are used to build the copper primary conduction layers in advanced integrated circuits 
electrofill uses copper to fill a structure created within the circuit s insulating layers in a manufacturing process called copper damascene 
damascene manufacturing reverses the manufacturing process used with aluminum  where the metal is deposited first  then etched to create lines and vias  and finally filled with insulating layers between the metal lines 
our highly reliable and cost effective electrofill products employ liquid chemistries and electrolytic principles to deposit the copper wiring into the dielectric structure 
sabre the sabre copper electrofill system  introduced in  is one of the most reliable and technologically advanced copper ecd systems available on the market 
sabre meets today s technology requirements for copper metal layers to nanometer  or micron  line widths and beyond 
the sabre employs a proprietary electrofilling cell that eliminates contamination of the back of the wafer with copper 
it features a unique plating cell design that improves the repeatability of the copper fill 
the simplicity of sabre s design is the key to the system s high reliability and manufacturing availability 
when coupled with the inova pvd system  sabre provides a complete system for depositing advanced copper interconnects 
sabre xt the second generation sabre xt  introduced in  is the industry s leading ecd platform for both mm and mm wafers 
new features on the sabre xt that were not found on the original sabre include programmable electrical waveforms  advanced plating chemistries  an integrated anneal module and closed loop chemical monitoring 

table of contents sabre next introduced in  the sabre next nano era xt builds on the sabre xt s production track record  offering a proprietary  single step chemistry  a new anode cell design  and other hardware refinements to tackle the complex process requirements of nanometer  nanometer and nanometer interconnect structures 
in comparison to the sabre xt  the sabre next reduces chemical costs by over  and when combined with improved throughput  cuts overall cost of ownership by over on what is already a highly productive process 
surface preparation technologies photoresist strip and clean processes represent an area of semiconductor manufacturing that is becoming increasingly important with the industry s migration to copper interconnects 
chipmakers use surface preparation products to remove photoresist and other potential contaminants from a wafer before proceeding with the next deposition step in the manufacturing process 
we entered this application arena by acquiring gasonics in  and today we are one of the industry s leading suppliers of dry clean surface preparation products 
gamma the gamma mm photoresist removal system uses a plasma source to strip photoresist 
the gamma architecture features a multi station sequential processing design with six strip stations  resulting in high wafer throughput with a minimal number of critical subsystems 
gamma the gamma system is a front end of line photoresist strip system for mm wafers 
our multi station sequential processing architecture incorporates six stations within a single process chamber  enabling a higher throughput rate than the closest competitor 
pep iridia the pep iridia is an advanced cleaning system designed for sub micron mm wafer applications 
the iridia s modular architecture allows manufacturers to configure the system for both front and back end of line cleaning applications down to nanometers 
targeted at critical steps in the copper and low k manufacturing processes  the iridia offers the highest productivity of any mm dry clean system currently on the market 
cmp technologies cmp systems polish the surface of a wafer after a deposition step to create a flat topography before moving on to subsequent manufacturing steps 
since copper is more difficult to polish and smooth than previous generation aluminum interconnects and low k dielectrics are much more porous than their predecessors  cmp has been elevated to the forefront of the enabling technology required in a copper damascene manufacturing process 
in recognition of this trend  we acquired speedfam ipec  a global supplier of cmp systems used in the fabrication of advanced copper interconnects  in we believe that the opportunity to integrate the planarization  deposition and surface preparation steps and optimize them for overall performance gives us an important advantage in extending copper and low k processes to advanced semiconductor devices 
momentum momentum is a high throughput  dry in dry out cmp system for all mm wafer process applications 
designed with extendibility to accommodate future reductions in line widths  the momentum has four independent wafer polishing platens that allow for maximum manufacturing flexibility 
momentum also employs a patented orbital polishing motion that minimizes surface dishing and erosion  and features a through the pad slurry delivery system that results in more efficient consumption of polishing chemicals 
momentum our momentum is a highly flexible  dry in dry out cmp system that provides a transition for manufacturers moving from mm to mm wafer processing 
the system is unique in that it combines a number of advanced planarization and in line inspection technologies to produce highly effective throughput  yield management  superior process capabilities and low cost of ownership 

table of contents marketing  sales and service we market products worldwide to manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
in north america  we sell our products through a direct sales force that operates out of eight sales and support offices 
in europe  we sell our products through our sales and support facilities in france  germany  ireland  italy and the united kingdom 
in asia  we sell our products directly in china  japan  korea  malaysia  singapore and taiwan 
our japanese operations  with headquarters near tokyo  include ten sales offices 
the ability to provide prompt and effective field support is critical to our sales efforts  and we believe the support that we provide to our installed base has accelerated the penetration of certain key accounts 
we also believe that our marketing efforts are enhanced by the technical expertise of our research and development personnel  who provide customer process applications support and participate in a number of industry forums  conferences and technical symposia 
equally significant  we believe that the design simplicity of our systems substantially enhances our ability to support our customers 
in  we became the first semiconductor equipment manufacturer to extend our warranty up to months from shipment  and in we began to include under warranty the cost of preventive maintenance as well as the cost of consumable parts on some systems 
we offer maintenance contracts as an additional service to customers

we expect that sales of our products to relatively few customers none of which has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future 
export sales including sales by our japanese subsidiary for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales 
for the year ended december   export sales were million  or of net sales  while export sales for the year ended december  were million  or of net sales 
backlog as of december   our backlog was million  with approximately million of cancellations in the period subsequent to december  to the date of this annual report on form k 
as of december   our backlog was million  with approximately million of cancellations subsequent to december  our backlog includes only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within twelve months 
all orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers  with limited or no penalties 
some products are shipped in the same quarter in which the order was received 
for this reason  and because of possible changes in delivery schedules  cancellations of orders and delays in shipments  our backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily a reliable indicator of actual shipments for any succeeding period 
research and development the highly cyclical semiconductor manufacturing industry is subject to rapid technological change and continual new product introductions and enhancements 
our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in developing new and enhanced systems  and introducing them at competitive prices on a timely basis 
for this reason  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development programs 
our current research and development efforts are directed at developing new systems and processes and improving the capabilities of existing systems 
research and development programs include advanced pvd 
table of contents systems  advanced gap fill technology  primary conductor metals  low k dielectric materials  cmp systems  and additional advanced deposition and surface preparation technologies for the next generation of smaller geometry fabrication lines 
all new systems under development are capable of processing mm wafers 
expenditures for research and development during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these expenditures represented approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we believe that research and development expenditures will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our net sales in the future 
manufacturing our manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that we acquire from third party vendors and then integrate into a finished system 
we utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of major subassemblies  and we perform all system design  assembly and testing in house 
our outsourcing strategy enables us to minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures  and provides us with the flexibility to increase production capacity 
this strategy also allows us to focus on product differentiation through system design and quality control 
we believe that our use of outsourced product specialists enables our subsystems to incorporate the latest and most advanced technologies in robotics  gas panels and microcomputers without the need for in house expertise 
we strive to work as closely as possible with all of our suppliers to achieve mutual cost reduction through joint development efforts 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that such parts are available from multiple suppliers  certain key parts may only be obtained from a single or limited source 
these suppliers are  in some cases  thinly capitalized  independent companies who generate significant portions of their business from us and or a small group of other companies in the semiconductor industry 
we seek to reduce our dependence on single or limited source suppliers 
however  disruptions in parts delivery or termination of certain of these suppliers may occur  and such disruptions and terminations could have an adverse effect on our operations 
a prolonged inability to obtain certain parts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  and could result in our inability to meet customer demands on time 
we manufacture our systems in clean room environments similar to those used by semiconductor manufacturers for chip fabrication  which helps to minimize the amount of particulates and other contaminants in the final assembled system to improve yields and reduce the level of contaminants for our customers 
following assembly  we package our completed systems in plastic shrink wrap to maintain clean room standards during shipment 
competition significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include system performance and flexibility  cost  the size of each manufacturer s installed customer base  customer support capability and the breadth of a company s product line 
we believe that we compete favorably in all of the market segments we serve because of the fundamental advantages associated with our system performance and flexibility  low cost of ownership  high wafer yields and customer support 
however  we face substantial competition from both established competitors and potential new entrants in each of these markets 
installing and integrating capital equipment into a semiconductor production line represents a substantial investment 
for this reason  once a manufacturer chooses a particular vendor s capital equipment  experience has shown that the manufacturer will generally rely upon that equipment for the useful life of the specific application 
as a result  all of today s semiconductor equipment makers typically have difficulty in selling a product to a particular customer to replace or substitute for a competitor s product previously chosen or qualified by that customer 
in the cvd  pecvd  hdp and pvd markets  our principal competitor is applied materials  inc applied  a major supplier of systems who has established a substantial base of installed equipment among today s leading semiconductor manufacturers 
in the ecd market  our principal competitors are applied and semitool  inc our principal competitors in the surface preparation product arena are mattson technologies  inc and axcelis technologies  inc in the cmp market  our major competitors are applied and ebara corporation

filed a class action lawsuit against novellus in the united states district court for the district of oregon 
on august   david robinson  et al 
filed a class action lawsuit against novellus in the united states district court for the northern district of california  san jose division 
both lawsuits seek collective and or class action status for field service engineers who work for novellus and both lawsuits allege that field service engineers are entitled to compensatory damages in the form of overtime pay  liquidated damages  interest and attorneys fees and costs 
we are currently engaged in mediation with the plaintiffs in these actions 
at a mediation held on march   the parties to both lawsuits agreed to a settlement to be documented on or before april  as of the date of this annual report on form k  there is no written agreement binding the parties 
moreover  the settlement requires court approval  which may or may not be received 
approval is expected to be sought in the second quarter of because the settlement has not yet been documented or approved and because members of the class may be permitted to opt out of the class and file individual claims  we are unable to determine the total amount or a range of amounts for the settlement at this time 
if efforts to settle these lawsuits are not successful  we intend to vigorously defend against them 
other litigation we are a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide readers with an understanding of the company 
the following are included in our md a overview of our business and industry  results of operations  critical accounting policies  liquidity and capital resources  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  related parties  recent accounting pronouncements  forward looking statements  and risk factors 
table of contents overview of our business and industry novellus is a global supplier of equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits 
we develop  manufacture  sell and service equipment used by manufacturers of integrated circuits  or chips  who either incorporate the chips in their own products or sell the chips to other companies for use in electronic devices 
our goal is to use our expertise to increase our market share and strengthen our position as a leading supplier of semiconductor processing equipment by providing our customers with highly reliable products which help them reduce costs  increase productivity and remain competitive 
our business depends on capital expenditures made by chip manufacturers  who in turn are dependent on corporate and consumer demand for chips and the devices which use them 
since the industry in which we operate is driven by spending for electronic products  our business is directly affected by growth or contraction in the global economy as well as by the adoption of new technologies 
demand for personal computers  the expansion of the internet and telecommunications industries  and the emergence of new applications in consumer electronics have a direct impact on our business 
in addition  the industry is characterized by intense competition and rapidly changing technology 
during the recent global recession  we continued to work closely with our customers and make substantial investments in research and development in order to continue delivering innovative products which enhance productivity for our customers and utilize the latest technology 
we believe these investments have positioned us for growth in the coming year 
we focus on certain key quarterly financial data to manage our business 
net sales  gross profit  net income loss and net income loss per share are the primary measures we use to monitor performance 
net orders are used to forecast and plan future operations 
the following table sets forth certain quarterly and annual financial information for the periods indicated quarterly financial data first second third fourth year ended quarter quarter quarter quarter december  net sales gross profit net income loss diluted net income loss per share net orders net sales gross profit net income diluted net income per share net orders net sales gross profit net income loss diluted net income loss per share net orders the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to cyclical conditions which play a major role in the fluctuations in demand  as defined by net orders 
these fluctuations  in turn  affected our net sales over the past three years 
a decline in net orders for semiconductor equipment began in early and continued through while we have experienced a modest increase from  demand was weak through the first 
table of contents three quarters of net orders during the first three quarters of were sequentially volatile with a increase in the first quarter  an decrease in the second quarter  and an increase in the third quarter  reflecting uncertainty in the demand for semiconductor devices 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a sequential increase in net orders 
the net order growth in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by strengthening demand for corporate and consumer electronic devices  which resulted in an increase in our customers capacity utilization 
in addition  we experienced increased demand as a result of our customers transition to mm fabrication equipment 
we believe the increase in demand for our products during the fourth quarter of could be an indication of an industry recovery 
the receipt of net orders in a particular quarter affects revenue in subsequent quarters 
net orders turn to revenue either at shipment or upon customer acceptance of the equipment 
our revenue recognition policy addresses the distinction between revenue recognized upon shipment and revenue recognized upon customer acceptance 
equipment generally ships within two or three months of receiving the related order and if applicable  customer acceptance is typically received six to eight months after shipment 
these time lines are general estimates and actual times may vary depending on specific customer circumstances 
demand for our systems can vary significantly from period to period as a result of several factors  including  but not limited to  downturns in the economy and semiconductor industry  supply of and demand for semiconductor devices  and competition in the semiconductor industry among suppliers of similar products 
for these and other reasons  our results of operations for fiscal years  and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amount net sales years ended december  change change in in net sales the increase in net sales of million  or  from to was primarily due to slightly improved market conditions during  driven mainly by increased volume 
the increase in volume was a result of increased capital spending by our customers as demand for semiconductor devices began to increase 
the decrease in net sales of million  or  from to was primarily a result of reduced volume due to a substantial reduction in customer capital spending in response to weakened worldwide demand for semiconductor devices 
the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment has historically fluctuated with changes in the supply of and demand for semiconductor devices and other factors  including rapid technological advances in semiconductor manufacturing processes 
although net orders grew by million  or  to million in from million in  net sales decreased 
we experienced unprecedented demand for our equipment in and therefore  at the end of and prior to the industry wide downturn in early  we had a substantial amount of backlog  which shipped in the early part of and accounted for a significant portion of our net sales for that year 
geographical net sales as a percentage of total net sales were as follows based on the location of the customers facilities years ended december  north america europe asia the increase in net sales in europe and asia as a percentage of total net sales during was attributable to higher demand in japan  korea  and europe  partially offset by lower demand in taiwan and 
table of contents china 
a significant portion of our net sales is generated in asia  primarily due to the fact that a substantial portion of the world s semiconductor manufacturing capacity is located there 
we plan to continue to focus on expanding our market presence in asia as we believe that significant additional growth potential exists in this region over the long term 
gross profit years ended december  change change in in gross profit of net sales the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in compared to is due primarily to a million write down of inventory in  changes in product mix  and continued low absorption of our manufacturing overhead costs 
in the third quarter of  we experienced a sustained shift in our customers order patterns from mm to mm equipment  which resulted in reduced demand for our mm equipment 
furthermore  the levels of required spares inventory were reduced due to a streamlining of our worldwide spares distribution system 
these changes resulted in a portion of our inventory becoming excess or obsolete and led to a million write down of inventory 
the prolonged weakness in demand for semiconductor capital equipment has also continued to negatively affect our gross margin as we have continued to experience low absorption of our fixed overhead costs 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in compared to was primarily due to reduced absorption of fixed overhead costs resulting from lower production and shipments 
during and  and through our acquisition of gasonics in january  we expanded our manufacturing facilities to accommodate the unprecedented growth in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
as a result of the industry downturn and overall slowing economy that began in and continued through  net orders for our equipment were low and we continued to have low absorption of our fixed overhead costs related to the facilities in those periods 
the gross profit was reduced by a million charge associated with the write off of inventory related to two products  which we discontinued in connection with our restructuring plan 
the gross profit in was also impacted by a benefit of million related to our decision not to pay our bonuses and profit sharing because we did not meet the minimum performance guidelines required for these payments 
our gross profit from period to period is affected by the treatment of certain product sales in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  which superseded the earlier related guidance in sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  or sab for these sales  we recognize all of a product s cost upon shipment even though a portion of a product s revenue may be deferred until final payment is due  typically upon customer acceptance 
selling  general and administrative sg a years ended december  change change in in sg a of net sales sg a expense includes compensation and benefits for corporate  financial  marketing  and administrative personnel as well as travel expenses and professional fees 
also included are expenses for rents  utilities  and depreciation and amortization related to the assets utilized by these functions 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expense in is consistent with the increase in absolute dollars for the year ended december  is primarily due to higher salaries and litigation costs in  the expense resulting from the operations of speedfam ipec for the full year  and increased depreciation 
table of contents expense as a result of our early adoption of fin and subsequent purchase of properties previously accounted for as synthetic leases during the third quarter of the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in over was primarily due to a substantial reduction in net sales in as compared to the decrease in absolute dollars reflects the impact of the cost reduction measures that we implemented in the second half of  which contributed to cost savings in these cost reduction measures included executive and employee salary reductions and the consolidation of our facilities 
in addition  we had workforce reductions in the first and fourth quarter of research and development r d years ended december  change change in in research and development of net sales r d expense includes compensation and benefits for our research and development personnel  project materials  chemicals and other direct expenses incurred in product and technology development 
also included are expenses for equipment repairs and maintenance  rents  utilities  depreciation  and amortization expense associated with patents and purchased technologies 
our significant investments in r d over the past several years reflect our strong commitment to the continuous improvement of our current product lines and the development of new products and technologies 
despite the prolonged downturn in the industry and weakened demand for semiconductor equipment  we continue to believe that significant investment in r d is required to remain competitive  and we plan to continue to invest in new products and enhancement of our current product lines 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expense in remained relatively flat compared to the increase in absolute dollars in is primarily due to additional spending related to the continuing development of cmp technologies  which were acquired through the acquisition of speedfam ipec in december  and higher depreciation expense as a result of our early adoption of fin and subsequent purchase of properties previously accounted for as synthetic leases during the third quarter of the increase in r d expense as a percentage of net sales in over was primarily due to a substantial reduction in net sales in compared to the increase reflected our continued commitment to the development of new products and technologies to provide competitive cost advantages for our customers 
acquired in process research and development ipr d years ended december  change change in in ipr d of net sales in connection with the acquisition of speedfam ipec in december  we recorded a million charge to write off certain acquired ipr d in projects which qualify as ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a beta phase working prototype in which there is no significant remaining risk relating to the development 
the value assigned to ipr d was determined by considering the importance of each project to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the acquired ipr d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue estimates used to value the purchased ipr d were based on estimates of 
table of contents relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by speedfam ipec and its competitors 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on a weighted average cost of capital determined by examining market information for several comparable companies 
the weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  the percentage of completion of each project  anticipated market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
based on these factors  a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for valuing the ipr d 
the estimates used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
restructuring and other charges years ended december  change change in in restructuring and other charges of net sales the million restructuring and other charges for the year ended december  consisted of million for asset write offs including fixed assets and purchased technology  million for vacated facilities  million for severance  and million for legal settlements 
the asset write offs  facilities charges  and severance charges were recorded in connection with activities undertaken to align our cost structure with current business conditions 
restructuring and other charges in consisted of million related to vacated facilities and million of severance benefits for workforce reductions 
in  we implemented a restructuring plan and recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million and acquisition costs of million related to the acquisition of gasonics 
the restructuring and asset impairment charges included million related to vacated facilities  million related to abandoned assets associated with the discontinuation of certain projects and million related to a write off of abandoned purchased technology 
the discontinuation of two products resulted in a million inventory write down in  which is included in cost of sales for that year 
the charge for vacated facilities relates to rent obligations after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long term operating lease agreements 
when applicable  anticipated future sublease income related to the vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments 
additionally  certain fixed assets  including leasehold improvements  associated with the abandoned facilities that had no future economic benefit have been written off 
substantially all actions under the restructuring plans had been achieved as of december   except for future rent obligations of million  which are to be paid in cash through year for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the restructuring plans reduced our expenses by approximately million in  of which million relates to savings from vacated facilities and million relates to savings from workforce reductions 
we estimate cost savings related to facilities of approximately in resulting from the restructuring plans implemented prior to the restructuring saved us approximately million of expenses in fiscal  of which  million relates to savings from vacated facilities and million relates to savings from workforce reductions 
bad debt write off recovery years ended december  change change in in bad debt write off recovery of net sales 
table of contents in september  an outstanding account receivable balance was at risk for collection because the customer was facing financial difficulties  payment was overdue and overall industry conditions continued to deteriorate 
accordingly  we recorded a write off of million 
however  in the first quarter of  all amounts owed under this account receivable balance were collected  resulting in a benefit to operations of million 
other income  net years ended december  change change in in other income  net of net sales other income  net  includes interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expenses 
the decrease in other income  net  in from is attributable to lower interest income resulting from declining interest rates on interest bearing investments and a change in accounting related to properties previously accounted for under synthetic leases 
the change in synthetic lease accounting reduced our interest income by approximately million for the year ended december  in the first quarter of  we also recorded a loss of million related to the redemption of the speedfam ipec convertible subordinated notes 
the decrease in other income  net  as a percentage of net sales and in absolute dollars  in from was partially due to a decrease in interest income 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a continued decline in interest rates and a decrease in interest bearing investments after we used million of restricted investments to retire our liquid yield option notes tm  or lyons  in the third quarter of we also recorded a non cash charge of million for the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the retirement of the lyons in the third quarter of the decrease in other income in was partially offset by a million gain on the sale of an equity investment 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of in  zero percent in and in the effective tax rate benefit in was higher than in as a result of the combined benefit of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effective tax rate in was lower than in as a result of the larger benefits from tax credits in relation to lower profitability 
management believes the benefits of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will be realized due to anticipated future taxable income 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as the company s profits losses before taxes  tax legislation  the geographic composition of pre tax income and non deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  deferred tax assets  warranty obligations and restructuring and impairment charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sab  which superseded the earlier related guidance in sab we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
a multiple element arrangement is a transaction which may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets  and performance may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder generally recognized at the later of completion of the installation services or customer acceptance 
installation services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment 
we allocate revenue based on the residual method as a fair value has been established for installation services 
however  since final payment is not typically due until customer acceptance  we defer revenue for the final payment  which is in excess of the fair value of the installation services 
all other equipment sales are recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue related to sales of spare parts is recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in other accrued liabilities 
inventory valuation we periodically assess the recoverability of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts  to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage is written down to its estimated realizable value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
according to our policy  we completed goodwill impairment tests in the third and fourth quarters of the test performed in the third quarter was completed in connection with our restructuring plan implemented in that quarter 
our annual goodwill impairment test was completed in the fourth quarter 
the first step of the test identifies when impairment may have occurred  while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
the results of our impairment tests did not indicate impairment 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance of million principally related to acquired net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits that are not realizable until and beyond 
the valuation allowance includes million related to acquired deferred tax assets of speedfam ipec which will be credited to goodwill 
table of contents when realized and million related to stock option deductions which will be credited to equity when realized 
management believes the majority of deferred tax assets will be realized due to anticipated future income 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if in the future we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an increase to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period in which such determination is made 
warranty obligations our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for a predetermined amount of time on systems and modules for material and labor to repair and service the equipment 
we record the estimated cost of warranty coverage to cost of sales upon system shipment 
the estimated cost of warranty is determined by the warranty term  as well as the average historical labor and material costs for a specific product 
should actual product failure rates or material usage differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
these revisions could have a positive or negative impact on gross profit 
we review the actual product failure rates and material usage rates on a quarterly basis and adjust our warranty liability as necessary 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring activities initiated prior to december  were recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and restructuring activities after december  were recorded under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
 sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  and sab  restructuring and impairment charges 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved 
we account for business combination restructurings under the provisions of eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination and sab accordingly  restructuring accruals are recorded when management initiates an exit plan that will cause us to incur costs that have no future economic benefit 
certain restructuring charges related to long lived asset impairments are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
the restructuring accrual related to vacated facilities is calculated net of estimated sublease income 
sublease income is estimated based on current market quotes for similar properties and expected occupancy dates 
if we are unable to sublet these vacated properties as forecasted  if we are forced to sublet them at rates below our current estimates due to changes in market conditions  or if we change our sublease income estimate  we adjust the restructuring accruals accordingly 
foreign currency accounting the local currency is the functional currency for all foreign operations 
accordingly  translation gains or losses related to our foreign subsidiaries are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
foreign exchange contracts we conduct portions of our business in various foreign currencies 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany accounts payable denominated in us dollars recorded by our japanese subsidiary 
we also enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 
in and  these hedging contracts were denominated primarily in the japanese yen  taiwanese dollar  and korean won 
the forward foreign exchange contracts we use are generally short term in nature 
the effect of exchange rate changes on forward foreign exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items 
we believe these 
table of contents financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
net foreign currency gains and losses for effective and ineffective hedges have not been material to our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operating and capital resource requirements through cash flows from operations  sales of equity securities and borrowings 
our primary source of funds as of december  consisted of approximately  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this amount represents a decrease of million from the december  balance of  million 
the decrease was due primarily to the repayment of the speedfam ipec convertible subordinated notes at a redemption price of million  plus accrued interest of million  and capital expenditures of million 
the decrease was partially offset by positive cash generated from operations of million  proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option exercises of million  and net borrowings under lines of credit of million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the primary sources of cash from operating activities were net income  as adjusted to exclude non cash charges and benefits and changes in working capital accounts 
the changes in working capital accounts include a decrease in prepaid and other current assets of million  a decrease in inventories of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and the combined effect of decreases in accounts payable  accrued payroll and related expenses  income tax payable  deferred profit and other accrued liabilities of million 
the decrease in prepaid and other current assets was primarily attributable to an million income tax refund received in the first quarter of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was million  which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million and net purchases of short term investments of million  offset by a decrease in other assets of million 
a significant amount of the million of capital expenditures relates to our new enterprise resource management erm system 
as of december   we did not have any significant commitments to purchase property and equipment  except for additional capital expenditures of approximately million required to complete the implementation of our new erm system 
however  we expect to expend additional resources in the future to enhance the functionality of our erm system 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  which is primarily due to the repayment of the speedfam ipec convertible subordinated notes at a redemption price of million  partially offset by proceeds from employee stock compensation plans of million and net lines of credit borrowings of million 
on february   our board of directors renewed a stock repurchase program originally approved in september under the repurchase program  we may repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock through february  we believe that our current cash position  cash generated through operations and equity offerings  and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our needs through at least the next twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
 or fin fin requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity 
an entity is considered a variable interest entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired 
table of contents prior to february   the provisions of fin were to be applied at the end of periods ending after june  in october  the fasb issued a fasb draft position on fin  delaying the effective date of fin to periods ending after december   but encouraging early adoption 
we early adopted fin on june  pursuant to the guidelines of fin  we concluded that the lessor in our synthetic leases was a variable interest entity and that we were the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
as such  we were required to consolidate the variable interest lessor beginning on june  additionally  since each of the other lessees involved with this lessor had a variable interest in specified assets and liabilities of the variable interest lessor  we were only required to consolidate the specific assets  liabilities  and operating results associated with our synthetic leases 
as a result of the early adoption of fin  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million  net of tax  in the third quarter of fiscal as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the gross charge represents approximately million of pre tax depreciation that would have been recorded had we consolidated these assets from inception of the leases
