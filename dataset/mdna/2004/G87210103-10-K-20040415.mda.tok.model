item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance  our financial condition and our prospects 
we will discuss and provide our analysis in the following order overview discussion of operating results liquidity and capital resources off balance sheet arrangements impact of inflation critical accounting policies and use of estimates factors that may affect future results and other cautionary statements 
table of contents overview our business operates in four geographic segments comprised of europe  the americas  asia pacific and africa and in each of these geographic segments our principal sources of income include airfreight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  customs brokerage  contract logistics and other supply chain management services 
our recent growth in gross revenue and net revenue for the years ended january  which we refer to as fiscal and january  which we refer to as fiscal  compared to the respective prior year period  resulted from growth which we attribute to our acquisitions  favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar and the growth of our existing operations 
a significant portion of our expenses is variable and adjusts to reflect the level of our business activities 
other than transportation costs  staff costs are our single largest variable expense and are less flexible in the near term as we must staff to meet uncertain future demand 
description of services revenue recognition airfreight forwarding when we act as an airfreight forwarder  we conduct business as an indirect carrier or occasionally as an authorized agent for the airline which carries the shipment 
in both cases  gross revenue and applicable costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin 
when we act as an indirect air carrier  we procure shipments from a large number of customers  consolidate shipments bound for a particular destination from a common place of origin  determine the routing over which the consolidated shipment will move  and purchase cargo space from airlines on a volume basis 
as an indirect air carrier  our gross revenue includes the rate charged to the client for the movement of the shipment on the airline  plus the fees we charge for our other ancillary services such as preparing shipment related documentation and materials handling related services 
airfreight forwarding gross revenue includes expedited movement by ground transportation and our domestic delivery service in south africa 
when we act as an indirect air carrier  our net revenue is the differential between the rates charged to us by the airlines and  where applicable  expedited ground transport operators  and the rates we charge our customers plus the fees we receive for our other services 
therefore  our net revenue is influenced by our ability to charge our customers a rate which is higher than the rate we obtain from the airlines  but which is also lower than the rate the customers could otherwise obtain directly from the airlines 
when we act as an authorized agent for the airline which carries the actual shipment  our gross revenue is primarily derived from commissions received from the airline plus fees for the ancillary services we provide  such as preparing shipment related documentation and materials handling related services 
our gross revenue does not include airline transportation costs when we act as an authorized agent 
accordingly  our gross revenue and net revenue are not materially different in this situation 
ocean freight forwarding when we act as an ocean freight forwarder  we conduct business as an indirect ocean carrier or occasionally as an authorized agent for the ocean carrier which carries the shipment 
our gross revenue and net revenue from ocean freight forwarding and related costs are recognized the same way that our gross revenue and net revenue from airfreight forwarding and related costs are recognized 
when we act as an indirect ocean carrier or non vessel operating common carrier  we contract with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points in a specified time period at an agreed upon rate 
we then solicit freight from customers to fill the containers and consolidate the freight bound for a particular destination from a common shipping point 
as in the case when we act as an indirect airfreight forwarder  our gross revenue in this situation includes the rate charged to the customer for the movement of the shipment on the ocean carrier plus our fees for the other services we provide which are related to the movement of goods such as preparing shipment related documentation 
our net 
table of contents revenue is determined by the differential between the rates charged to us by the carriers and the rates we charge our customers along with the fees we receive for our other ancillary services 
when we act as an authorized agent for an ocean carrier  our gross revenue is generated from the commission we receive from the carrier plus the fees we charge for the ancillary services we provide 
our gross revenue does not include transportation costs when we act as an authorized agent for an ocean carrier 
under these circumstances  our gross revenue and net revenue are not materially different 
customs brokerage we provide customs clearance and brokerage services with respect to the majority of the shipments we handle as a freight forwarder 
we also provide customs brokerage services for shipments handled by our competitors 
these services include assisting with and performing regulatory compliance functions in international trade 
customs brokerage gross revenue is recognized when the necessary documentation for customs clearance has been completed 
this gross revenue is generated by the fees we charge for providing customs brokerage services  as well as the fees we charge for the disbursements made on behalf of a customer 
these disbursements  which typically include customs duties and taxes  are excluded from our calculations of gross revenue since they represent disbursements made on behalf of customers 
typically  disbursements are included in our accounts receivable and are several times larger than the amount of customs brokerage gross revenue generated 
contract logistics our contract logistics services primarily relate to our value added warehousing services and distribution of goods and materials in order to meet customers inventory needs and production or distribution schedules 
our distribution services include receiving  deconsolidation and decontainerization  sorting  put away  consolidation  assembly  cargo loading and unloading  assembly of freight and protective packaging  storage and distribution 
our outsourced services include inspection services  quality centers and manufacturing support 
contract logistics gross revenue is recognized when the service has been provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business 
we have expanded our contract logistics services with our acquisitions of standard in fiscal and sli in fiscal other services we also provide a range of other supply chain management services  such as road transportation  warehousing services  consulting  order management  planning and optimization services  outsourced distribution services  developing specialized customer specific supply chain solutions  and customized distribution and inventory management services 
our gross revenue in these capacities includes commissions and fees earned by us and are recognized upon performance 
acquisitions acquisitions affect the comparison of our results between years prior to when acquisitions are made and to subsequent years  depending on the date of acquisition ie  acquisitions made on february  the first day of our fiscal year will only affect a comparison with the prior year s results 
the results of acquired businesses are included in our consolidated financial statements from the dates of their respective acquisitions 
we consider the operating results of an acquired company during the first twelve months following the date of its acquisition to be an acquisition impact or a benefit from acquisitions 
thereafter  we consider the growth in an acquired company s results to be organic growth 
during the last two fiscal years  we completed two significant acquisitions which have had a material effect on the comparison of our operating results  increasing gross revenues  net revenues and expenses in fiscal and fiscal over the respective prior year 

table of contents in fiscal  the operating results of standard are included in our financial statements since the effective date of the acquisition  october  we acquired the entire issued share capital of standard for an initial purchase price of approximately million  of which approximately million represented goodwill and other intangible assets 
the final total consideration for this acquisition could be up to approximately million higher  but is dependent on certain performance criteria being achieved over the two year period following the date of acquisition 
of the million potential additional consideration  approximately million was paid in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the first year performance 
in fiscal  the operating results of the acquired operations for sli are included in our financial statements since the date of acquisition  january  uti acquired the entire issued share capital of sli  incorporated in spain  for two initial cash payments totaling approximately million  of which approximately million represented goodwill 
the remainder of the purchase price is contingent on future performance and is based on a multiple of the annual net income of the purchased operations over the period february  through january  the four contingent earn out payments are calculated on each year s results and are paid annually  using a deemed uti share price of approximately per ordinary share and are payable in ordinary shares or cash at the seller s option if the share price is below 
through january   one earn out payment  in cash  has been made totaling approximately million 
in december  we announced the signing of definitive agreements to acquire south african based international healthcare distributors pty 
limited which we refer to as ihd 
in march  we announced that we had received the approval of the south african competition authorities as well as signed distribution agreements from all selling shareholders of ihd 
however  certain wholesalers are challenging aspects of the ruling of the competition authorities  which includes a settlement agreement between the selling shareholders and the competition authorities 
the implementation of the settlement agreement is a pre condition to closing the proposed ihd transaction 
the appeals process is scheduled to begin in april in addition  since the execution of the acquisition agreements announced by the company on december   the south african government has announced its intention to introduce legislation that may impact the pharmaceutical industry in that country 
consequently  the sellers and uti are awaiting further developments concerning the proposed legislation in order to assess its potential impact  if any  on the currently proposed structure of the transaction 
there can be no assurances that the proposed transaction involving ihd will not be restructured or may not close for a variety of reasons  including the failure to satisfy closing or other conditions 
if the proposed transaction of ihd does occur  we would anticipate that our gross and net revenues for contract logistics would increase along with our operating expenses and applicable income taxes 
effect of foreign currency translation on comparison of results our reporting currency is the united states us dollar 
however  due to our global operations  we conduct and will continue to conduct business in currencies other than our reporting currency 
the conversion of these currencies into our reporting currency for reporting purposes will be affected by movements in these currencies against the us dollar 
a depreciation of these currencies against the us dollar would result in lower gross and net revenues reported  however as applicable costs are also converted from these currencies  costs would also be lower 
the net impact on our net income is therefore somewhat mitigated 
similarly  the opposite effect will occur if these currencies appreciate against the us dollar 
discussion of operating results the following discussion of our operating results explains material changes in our consolidated results of operations for fiscal and fiscal compared to the respective prior year 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  the accuracy of which involves risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements for many reasons  including  but not limited to  those factors described in this item under  factors that may affect future results and other cautionary statements  and elsewhere in this report 
we disclaim any 
table of contents obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statement 
our consolidated financial statements attached to this report  have been prepared in us dollars and in accordance with us gaap 
gross revenue gross revenue for our freight forwarding services is recognized in the region in which the shipment originates 
gross revenue for all other services is recognized in the region where the service is performed 
our gross revenue by operating segment is set forth in the following table in thousands year ended january  of of of gross gross gross amount revenue amount revenue amount revenue europe americas asia pacific africa gross revenue gross revenue increased million  or  to billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal of the total increase for fiscal  million was due to the impact of the acquisition of standard and million was due to the impact of favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
the remaining increase in gross revenue was due to organic growth and the impact of certain less significant acquisitions 
by service line  our total increase in gross revenue was due to increases in fiscal over fiscal in contract logistics  airfreight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  other revenue and customs brokerage 
gross revenue increased to billion for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due to increases in gross revenue for contract logistics  airfreight forwarding  ocean freight forwarding  other revenue and customs brokerage 
we estimate that acquisitions completed during fiscal accounted for million of our gross revenue for fiscal we believe that net revenue is a better measure than gross revenue of the importance to us of our various services since our gross revenue for our services as an indirect air and ocean carrier includes the carriers charges to us for carriage of the shipment 
when we act as an indirect air and ocean carrier  our net revenue is determined by the differential between the rates charged to us by the carrier and the rates we charge our customers plus the fees we receive for our ancillary services 
net revenue derived from freight forwarding generally is shared between the points of origin and destination 
our gross revenue in our other capacities includes only commissions and fees earned by us and is substantially the same as our net revenue 

table of contents the following table shows our net revenues and our operating expenses for the periods presented  expressed as a percentage of total net revenues 
year ended january  net revenues airfreight forwarding ocean freight forwarding customs brokerage contract logistics other total net revenues operating expenses staff costs depreciation and amortization amortization of intangible assets other operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense gains losses on foreign exchange pretax income provision for income taxes minority interests net income less than one percent 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal overall  our net revenue benefited from the full year effect of acquisitions made in fiscal primarily standard and from the impact of acquisitions made during fiscal as well as from favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar and organic growth from our operations 
on a constant currency basis  when we translate our fiscal results using currency exchange rates in effect for fiscal  we estimate that acquisitions and favorable exchange rates accounted for approximately million and million  respectively  of the net revenue increase for fiscal versus the prior fiscal year 
the total increase due to acquisitions of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflects the acquisition benefit of standard on net revenues of million 
airfreight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase primarily resulted from favorable exchange rates as compared to the us dollar in fiscal when compared to fiscal  mostly in our africa and europe regions  due to changes in the south african rand and the euro  respectively  and to organic growth in all regions 
increased volumes in africa led to growth in that region 
the europe region improved their yields to help offset lower export volumes  resulting in an overall increase in the europe region s net revenues  excluding the currency translation impact 
asia pacific s volumes grew in fiscal over the prior year  even considering the higher volumes reported in fiscal as a result of increased demand in airfreight 
table of contents created by last year s west coast port lock out 
we also experienced some growth in airfreight forwarding net revenues in the americas region as slightly higher export volumes offset a slight decline in yields 
ocean freight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was due primarily to increased volumes in fiscal versus fiscal  especially in the africa and asia pacific regions  which offset our decline in yields caused by price increases from ocean carriers which were typically passed through to customers at lower margins than we have historically experienced 
customs brokerage net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal customs brokerage net revenue increased primarily as a result of the higher shipping volumes resulting from increased demand for our services 
contract logistics net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to the full year contribution from the standard acquisition in fiscal other net revenue  which includes revenue from our other supply chain management services including outsourced distribution services  increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was also primarily due to the full year contribution from the standard acquisition in fiscal staff costs increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year  primarily as a result of the addition of personnel in connection with our acquisition of standard  which accounted for approximately million of the total increase 
staff costs were also generally higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of an increase in reported costs in the europe and africa regions over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year 
the increase in total staff costs expressed as a percentage of net revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily related to standard s contract logistics business which has historically experienced higher staff costs as a percentage of net revenues than our freight forwarding operations and we expect staff costs to generally be higher when expressed as a percentage of net revenues as compared to our historic trends 
staff costs are the largest component of operating expenses and we strive to manage these costs in relation to net revenue growth 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  for fiscal over fiscal to million primarily due to increases in capital spending for computer equipment and fixtures and fittings during the period  along with the impact of fiscal acquisitions and the full year impact of fiscal acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization expense declined slightly to of net revenue in fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal generally these expenses increased because of the full year impact of our acquisition of standard estimated to be million and also because of an increase in reported costs in the europe and africa regions over the prior year as a result of the stronger euro and south african rand  respectively  as compared to the us dollar during the year 
included in other operating expenses for fiscal are facilities and communications costs of million compared to million of such costs for the prior fiscal year 
facilities and communications costs increased primarily as a result of the addition of new locations in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year  including those acquired with standard 
the balance of the other operating expenses is comprised of selling  general and administrative costs 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs were million compared to million for the same prior year period 
the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was primarily a result of the acquisition of standard estimated to be million and secondarily to the stronger euro and south african rand when compared to the us dollar 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal our interest income relates primarily to interest earned on our cash deposits  while our interest expense consists primarily of interest on our credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
both interest income and 
table of contents interest expense increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal by million  or  and million  or  respectively 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to the higher levels of cash balances in fiscal due to the cash received in december from our follow on stock offering  while the increase in interest expense was due primarily to the acquisition impact of standard 
the effective income tax rate decreased to in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the prior year effective income tax rate including the establishment of certain valuation allowances and changes in local tax rates  which were not repeated in fiscal our overall tax rate is impacted by the geographic composition of our worldwide taxable income  with some of our operations in countries with low effective income tax rates 
for fiscal  we currently anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately  although such rate may fluctuate due to the geographic mix of our taxable income 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year for the reasons listed above 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal overall  our net revenue benefited from acquisitions made during fiscal primarily standard as well as from the full year effect of acquisitions made in fiscal primarily sli 
we estimate that acquisitions accounted for approximately million of the net revenue increase for fiscal versus the prior fiscal year 
airfreight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase primarily resulted from higher volumes in all regions  but particularly in the asia pacific region  partially offset by negative pricing pressures and a lower overall airfreight yield 
fiscal airfreight forwarding net revenue for asia pacific  where there was increased demand in airfreight created by the west coast port lock out  increased over the prior year 
airfreight forwarding net revenue in europe also benefited from acquisitions in addition to increased volumes  resulting in growth of in fiscal when compared to fiscal we experienced pricing pressures in all regions as a result of carrier capacity restraints and  in the asia pacific region  as a result of our air charter program that we employed to secure airfreight capacity for our customers 
the overall airfreight yield also declined because of a shift in our geographic mix of gross revenues with an increasing share from the asia pacific region where our yields are at lower levels than the company s historic average yield  thereby depressing the overall yield 
ocean freight forwarding net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to increased volumes in fiscal versus fiscal and secondarily to acquisitions 
volume increases were tempered somewhat by negative pricing pressures 
africa and europe experienced growth in ocean freight forwarding net revenue  with increases of and  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal  benefiting primarily from the sli acquisition and  to a lesser degree  increased volumes from our operations in existence prior to fiscal customs brokerage net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal customs brokerage net revenue increased primarily as a result of the higher shipping volumes resulting from increased demand for our services 
contract logistics net revenue increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was primarily due to contributions from the standard and sli acquisitions  which contributed four and twelve months of operating results  respectively  and  to a lesser degree  new business 
other net revenue  which includes revenue from our other supply chain management services such as road transportation  consulting  order management  planning and optimization services  increased million  
table of contents or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to contributions from the standard and sli acquisitions  and  to a lesser degree  new business 
staff costs increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for the prior year  primarily as a result of the addition of personnel in connection with our acquisitions of standard and sli 
staff costs  however  remained constant when expressed as a percentage of net revenue  at in both fiscal and fiscal staff costs are the largest component of operating expenses and we strive to manage these costs in relation to net revenue growth 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  for fiscal over fiscal to million primarily due to increases in capital spending for computer equipment and fixtures and fittings during the period  along with the impact of fiscal acquisitions and the full year impact of fiscal acquisitions 
depreciation expense remained constant at of net revenue in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
amortization of intangible assets decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior year 
we ceased amortizing goodwill effective february  when we adopted sfas no 
 however  we recorded amortization expense of million related to the amortization of other intangible assets acquired with standard 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal included in other operating expenses for fiscal are facilities and communications costs of million compared to million of such costs for the prior year 
facilities and communications costs increased primarily as a result of the addition of new locations in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year  including the acquisitions of standard and sli 
the balance of the other operating expenses is comprised of selling  general and administrative costs 
for fiscal  selling  general and administrative costs were million compared to million for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative costs was primarily a result of the acquisitions of standard and sli 
when expressed as a percentage of net revenue  other operating expenses increased from for fiscal to for fiscal net interest expense  consisting primarily of interest on our credit facilities and capital lease obligations offset by interest income on our cash deposits  decreased million to million in fiscal from million for the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to decreased borrowings during fiscal as compared to fiscal  along with increased interest income for the cash on deposit received in december from our follow on stock offering 
there was a net loss on foreign exchange of million in fiscal compared to a gain of  for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to exchange losses recorded upon the settlement of intercompany loans in the fourth quarter of fiscal the effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year 
our overall tax rate is impacted by the geographic composition of our worldwide taxable income  with some of our operations in countries with low effective income tax rates 
net income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal as compared to the prior year for the reasons listed above 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  representing a decrease of million from january   as a result of using a net amount of million of cash in our operating  investing and financing activities and a negative impact of million related to the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on our cash balances 
historically  we have used our internally generated net cash flow from operating activities along with the net proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 

table of contents in fiscal  we generated approximately million in net cash from operating activities 
this resulted from net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of intangible assets totaling million and other items totaling million  plus a net decrease in working capital of approximately million 
during fiscal  we used approximately million of cash for acquisitions and contingent earn out payments  of which approximately million was used to acquire indair carriers pvt ltd 
and kite logistics pty limited and the balance was used for contingent earn out payments for acquisitions made in prior fiscal years 
our earn out payments made in fiscal included the final earn out payment related to our acquisition of continental of approximately million  the first of four contingent earn out payments for our acquisition of sli of approximately million and the first of two contingent earn out payments for standard of approximately million 
future earn out payment calculations  which may result in a significant use of cash  include the second and final earn out payment for standard  which is limited by the purchase agreement to be no more than million and is scheduled for the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the three remaining earn out payment calculations related to our acquisition of sli each of which scheduled for the second quarter of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
during fiscal  cash used for capital expenditures was million  consisting primarily of computer hardware and software and furniture  fixtures and fittings 
based on our current operations  we do not expect our capital expenditures to be significantly higher in fiscal when compared to fiscal our financing activities during fiscal used million of cash  primarily due to reductions on bank lines of credit and short term borrowings totaling approximately million 
additionally  we paid dividends of million during fiscal we expect to use approximately million of cash in the second quarter of fiscal for the payment of dividends on our ordinary shares as declared by our board of directors on april  credit facilities we have various bank credit facilities established in countries where such facilities are required for our business 
at january  these facilities provided for lines of credit from approximately million to million  and provided for guarantees  which are a necessary part of our business  totaling million  and a total borrowing capacity of million 
due to the global nature of our business  we utilize a number of different financial institutions to provide these various facilities 
consequently  the use of a particular credit facility is normally restricted to the country in which it originated and a particular credit facility may restrict distributions by the subsidiary operating in the country 
our borrowings under these facilities totaled million at january  and we had approximately million of available  unused borrowing capacity under our various bank credit facilities 
most of our borrowings are secured by grants of security interests in accounts receivable and other assets  including pledges of stock of our subsidiaries 
the interest rates on these facilities vary and ranged from to at january  these rates are generally linked to the prime lending rate in each country where we have facilities 
we use our credit facilities to primarily fund our working capital needs as well as to provide for customs bonds and guarantees and forward exchange transactions 
while the majority of our borrowings are due and payable within one year  we believe we will be able to renew such facilities on commercially reasonable terms 
our current largest credit facility is with nedcor bank limited nedcor bank  totaling million british pounds sterling equivalent to approximately million as of january  
of this facility  approximately million is primarily used for guarantees and standby letters of credit to secure banking facilities and million is primarily used for guaranteeing performance undertakings of our subsidiary companies 
the facility is available on an ongoing basis until further notice  subject to nedcor bank s credit review procedures and may be terminated by the bank at any time 
the facility is secured by cross guarantees and indemnities of selected subsidiary companies 
as of the date of this filing  uti  us holdings  inc  the us parent company of our operating subsidiary companies in the united states  is in the process of negotiating a proposed senior revolving credit facility primarily for use in our operations in the united states 
if completed  it is currently anticipated that 
table of contents the proposed facility would provide for borrowings based upon a borrowing base formula 
in the event the proposed credit facility is not finalized  we believe we have sufficient working capital in order to fund our operations in the united states as currently conducted without disruption or adverse consequences 
contractual obligations at january   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period less than after total year years years years bank and other long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations unconditional purchase obligations total includes interest 
we believe that with our current cash position  various bank credit facilities and operating cash flows  we have sufficient means to meet our working capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months as our operations are currently conducted 
the nature of our operations necessitates dealing in many foreign currencies and our results are subject to fluctuations due to changes in exchange rates 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation to date  our business has not been significantly or adversely affected by inflation 
historically  we have been generally successful in passing carrier rate increases and surcharges on to our customers by means of price increases and surcharges 
direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to medium term 
due to the high degree of competition in the marketplace  these rate increases might lead to an erosion of our profit margins 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of our operating and financial review and prospects is based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with us gaap and contained within this report 
certain amounts included in  or affecting  our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
therefore  the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates 
in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures  we must use estimates in determining the economic useful lives of our assets  obligations under our employee benefit plans  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable and various other recorded and disclosed amounts 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
our significant accounting polices are included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  however  we believe that certain accounting policies are more critical to our financial 
table of contents statement preparation process than others 
these include our policies on revenue recognition  income taxes  allowance for doubtful receivables  goodwill  contingencies and currency translation 
revenue recognition gross revenue represents billings on exports to customers  plus net revenue on imports  net of any billings for value added taxes  custom duties and freight insurance premiums whereby we act as an agent 
gross revenue and freight consolidation costs for airfreight and ocean freight forwarding services  including commissions earned from our services as an authorized agent for airline and ocean carriers and third party freight insurers  are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin which is when the customer is billed 
gross customs brokerage revenue  contract logistics revenue and other revenue are recognized when we bill the customer  which for customs brokerage revenue is when the necessary documentation for customs clearance has been completed  and for contract logistics and other revenue is when the service has been provided to third parties in the ordinary course of business 
net revenue is determined by deducting freight consolidation costs from gross revenue 
freight consolidation costs are recognized at the time the freight departs the terminal of origin 
certain costs  related primarily to ancillary services  are estimated and accrued at the time the services are provided  and adjusted upon receipt of the final suppliers invoice 
income taxes our overall effective income tax rate is determined by the geographic composition of our worldwide taxable income  with some of our operations in countries with low effective income tax rates 
consequently our accrual of tax expense on an interim basis is based on an estimate of our overall effective tax rate for the related annual period 
deferred income taxes are accounted for using the liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable income 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences 
deferred income taxes are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled 
deferred income taxes are charged or credited to the income statement 
deferred income tax assets are offset by valuation allowances so that the assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable income will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized 
we consider our historical performance  forecast taxable income and other factors when we determine the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to determine future taxable income to be reasonable  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful receivables we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on a variety of factors and estimates 
these factors include historical customer trends  general and specific economic conditions and local market conditions 
we believe our estimate for doubtful receivables is based on reasonable assumptions and estimates  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates goodwill the company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 

in accordance with sfas no 
 no amortization was recorded for goodwill for acquisitions completed after june  further  effective february   in accordance with sfas no 
 the company discontinued the amortization relating to all existing goodwill 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment 
this assessment requires the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit as compared to its carrying 
table of contents value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units on the income approach  which requires the use of estimates in determining future revenues  cash flows and capital expenditures  as well as market trends and growth 
we believe these estimates and assumptions to be reasonable  although they are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company completes the required impairment test annually in the second quarter  or when certain events occur or circumstances change 
contingencies we are subject to a range of claims  lawsuits and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and its legal counsel 
where the company is self insured in relation to freight related exposures  adequate liabilities are estimated and recorded for the portion the company is self insured 
when estimates of our exposure from claims or pending or threatened litigation matters meet the recognition criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings 
the ultimate resolution of any exposure to us may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
currency translation for consolidation purposes  balance sheets of subsidiaries expressed in currencies other than us dollars are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
operating results for the year are translated using average rates of exchange for the year 
gains and losses on translation are recorded as a separate component of equity and are included in other comprehensive income or loss 
transactions in foreign currencies during the year are remeasured at rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the transactions 
these gains and losses arising on remeasurement are accounted for in the income statement 
exchange differences arising on the translation of long term structural loans to subsidiary companies are recorded as other comprehensive income or loss 
assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date of the company s subsidiaries expressed in currencies different to their functional currencies  are remeasured at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
the financial statements of foreign entities that report in the currency of a hyper inflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit currency at the balance sheet date before they are translated into us dollars

factors that may affect future results and other cautionary statements in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form k  you should consider carefully the following factors and uncertainties in evaluating our business 
our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  and the following list should not be considered to be a definitive list of all factors that may affect our business  financial condition and future results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the factors  risks and uncertainties contained in our other filings with the securities 
table of contents and exchange commission 
we caution readers that any forward looking statements made by us are made with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act and that a number of factors  including but not limited to those discussed below  could cause our actual results and experiences to differ materially from the anticipated results or expectations expressed in any forward looking statements 
we conduct business throughout the world and we expect that our results of operations may be impacted by international trade volumes and by global and regional economic conditions 
our business is related to and dependent on general world economic conditions  and the local  regional  national and international conditions that affect international trade and the specific regions or countries that we serve 
we are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in our customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries such as chemicals  pharmaceuticals and apparel  where we have a significant concentration of customers 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts  may adversely affect the global economy  our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
the consequences of any armed conflict are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business 
we expect that our revenue and results of operations will continue to be sensitive to global and regional economic conditions 
our international presence exposes us to potential difficulties associated with managing distant operations and to regulatory  tariff  licensing and other risks 
we conduct a majority of our business outside of the united states and we anticipate that revenue from foreign operations will continue to account for a significant amount of our future revenue 
our international operations are directly related to and dependent on the volume of international trade and local market conditions 
our international operations and international commerce are influenced by many factors  including changes in economic and political conditions and in governmental policies  changes in international and domestic customs regulations  wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts  natural disasters  changes in tariffs  trade restrictions  trade agreements and taxation  difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations  limitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls  different liability standards  and intellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region 
restrictions and controls on investments and acquisitions outside of the united states and our ability to conduct business with local agents in particular countries may restrict our ability to operate in those countries 
investments in joint ventures or businesses outside of the united states have been and will continue to be restricted or controlled to varying degrees 
these restrictions or controls have and may continue to limit or preclude investments in proposed joint ventures or business acquisitions outside of the united states or increase our costs and expenses in seeking to effect such transactions 
various governments require 
table of contents governmental approval prior to investments by foreign persons and limit the extent of any such investments 
in some countries  we may be required by local regulations to conduct operations pursuant to an agency or sponsorship agreement 
even if not required by regulations  we may conduct business in a country with a local agent who can provide knowledge of the local market conditions and facilitate the acquisition of necessary licenses and permits 
the loss of an agent or sponsor could result in the temporary or permanent cessation of operations in a particular country 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace such agent or sponsor on favorable terms  if at all 
furthermore  various governments restrict investment opportunities by foreign persons in some industries or may require governmental approval for the repatriation of capital and income by foreign investors 
there can be no assurance that such approvals will be forthcoming in the future 
there also can be no assurance that additional or different restrictions or adverse policies applicable to us will not be imposed in the future or  if imposed  as to the duration or impact of any such restrictions or policies 
foreign currency fluctuations could result in currency translation exchange gains or losses or could increase or decrease the book value of our assets 
our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
in fiscal year  we derived a substantial portion of our gross revenue in currencies other than the united states dollar and  due to the global nature of our operations  we expect in the foreseeable future to continue to conduct a significant amount of our business in currencies other than our reporting currency 
appreciation or depreciation in the value of other currencies as compared to our reporting currency will result in currency translation exchange gains or losses which  if the appreciation or depreciation is significant  could be material 
in those areas where our revenue is denominated in a local currency rather than our reporting currency  a depreciation of the local currency against the united states dollar could adversely affect our reported united states dollar earnings 
additionally  the assets and liabilities of our international operations are denominated in each country s local currency 
as such  when the value of those assets is translated into united states dollars  foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the book value of our assets 
we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results 
we will experience the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our consolidated net income in the future 
we have significant operations located in south africa which are subject to various economic  regulatory  political and other uncertainties and factors which could adversely impact our operations located in that country 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our net revenues were generated in south africa and our south african assets represented approximately of our total assets as of january  south africa faces a number of social  political and economic issues which may affect our south african operations 
the government of south africa and the south african business community have recently undertaken a number of significant steps designed to involve historically disadvantaged south africans in the ownership and management of south african businesses and to achieve broad based black empowerment in the south african economy 
in january  the south african government enacted legislation requiring business enterprises to develop empowerment plans and to report on their compliance with those plans 
the purpose of the legislation is to empower historically disadvantaged south africans through diverse but integrated social economic strategies including direct empowerment  the object of which is the promotion of ownership and control of the south african economy  the promotion of human resource development  and indirect empowerment incorporating criteria such as the level of procurement sourced from businesses which are owned or empowered by historically disadvantaged south africans and investments in  and joint ventures with  businesses empowered or owned by historically disadvantaged south africans 
our operations in south africa are currently not certified as being black empowered for purposes of the legislation and we are actively considering the steps which will be necessary for us to become certified as black empowered 
to achieve such certification  it may be necessary for us to restructure a portion of our south african operations or to dispose of a portion of our south african assets 
unless our operations become certified as black empowered  our existing customers may curtail or discontinue doing business with us or 
table of contents we may be unable to acquire additional business from new customers to the extent those customers seek to do business with black empowered enterprises 
in this event  our investments in south africa and our south african revenue and operating profits may be adversely affected 
because our business is dependent on commercial airfreight carriers and air charter operators  ocean freight carriers and other transportation companies  changes in available cargo capacity and other changes affecting such carriers as well as interruptions in service or work stoppages by such carriers may negatively impact our business 
we rely on commercial airfreight carriers and air charter operators  ocean freight carriers  trucking companies and other transportation companies for the movement of our customers cargo 
consequently  our ability to provide these services for our clients could be adversely impacted by shortages in available cargo capacity  changes by carriers and transportation companies in policies and practices such as scheduling  pricing  payment terms and frequency of service or increases in the cost of fuel  taxes and labor  and other factors not within our control 
reductions in airfreight or ocean freight capacity could negatively impact our yields 
material interruptions in service or stoppages in transportation  whether caused by strike  work stoppage  lock out  slowdown or otherwise  could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business is subject to seasonal trends 
historically  our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
our first fiscal quarter is traditionally weaker compared with our other fiscal quarters 
this trend is dependent on numerous factors  including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  consumer demand  climate  economic conditions and numerous other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our historic operating patterns will continue in future periods as we cannot influence or forecast many of these factors 
comparisons of our operating results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and it is likely that they will continue to fluctuate in the future because of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors and changes in the shipping patterns of our customers may adversely impact our operating results 
in addition  the following factors could also cause fluctuations in our operating results personnel costs  timing and magnitude of capital expenditures  costs relating to the expansion of operations  costs and revenue fluctuations due to acquisitions  pricing and availability of cargo space on airlines  ships and trucks which we utilize to transport freight  adjustments in inventory levels  customer discounts and credits  and changes in our customers requirements for contract logistics and outsourcing services 
because our quarterly revenues and operating results vary significantly  comparisons of our results from period to period are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance 

table of contents we have grown and plan to grow  in part  through acquisitions of other freight forwarders  contract logistics providers  customs brokers  and other supply chain management providers 
growth by acquisitions involves risks and we may not be able to identify or acquire companies consistent with our growth strategy or successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations 
we have grown through acquisitions and we may pursue opportunities to expand our business by acquiring other companies in the future 
acquisitions involve risks including those relating to identification of appropriate acquisition candidates or negotiation of acquisitions on favorable terms and valuations  integration of acquired businesses and personnel  implementation of proper business and accounting controls  ability to obtain financing  on favorable terms or at all  diversion of management attention  retention of employees and customers  and unexpected liabilities 
our growth strategy may affect short term cash flow and net income as we expend funds  increase indebtedness and incur additional expenses in connection with pursuing acquisitions 
if we are not able to identify or acquire companies consistent with our growth strategy or if we fail to successfully integrate any acquired companies into our operations  we may not achieve anticipated increases in revenue  cost savings and economies of scale  and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our growth and profitability may not continue  which may result in a decrease in our stock price 
we experienced significant growth in revenue and operating income over the past several years 
there can be no assurance that our growth rate will continue or that we will be able to effectively adapt our management  administrative and operational systems to respond to any future growth 
we can provide no assurance that our operating margins will not be adversely affected by future changes in and expansion of our business or by changes in economic or political conditions 
slower or less profitable growth or losses could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not succeed with our nextleap strategic operating plan  and as a result our revenue and profitability may not increase 
we recently completed the second year of nextleap  our five year strategic operating plan 
under nextleap  we are undertaking various efforts to attempt to increase our customers and revenue  improve our operating margins  and train and develop our employees 
this strategic operating plan requires that we successfully manage our operations and growth 
our business is subject to numerous factors beyond our control and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully implement nextleap or that our efforts will result in increased revenues or improved margins or profitability 
if we are not able to increase our revenue or improve our operating margins in the future  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our effective income tax rate will impact our results of operations  our cash flow and our profitability 
we have international operations and generate taxable income in different countries throughout the world  with different effective income tax rates 
our future effective income tax rate will be impacted by a number of factors  including the geographical composition of our worldwide taxable income 
if the tax laws of the countries in which we operate are rescinded or changed or the united states or other foreign tax authorities were to change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner or jurisdiction in which our profits currently are recognized  our effective income tax rate could increase  which would adversely impact our cash flow and profitability 

table of contents we face intense competition in the freight forwarding  contract logistics and supply chain management industry 
the freight forwarding  contract logistics and supply chain management industry is intensely competitive and we expect it to remain so for the foreseeable future 
we face competition from a number of companies  including many that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry 
we also encounter competition from regional and local third party logistics providers  freight forwarders and integrated transportation companies 
depending on the location of the customer and the scope of services requested  we must compete against both the niche players and larger competitors 
in addition  customers increasingly are turning to competitive bidding situations involving bids from a number of competitors  including competitors that are larger than us 
we also face competition from air and ocean carriers  computer information and consulting firms and contract manufacturers  all of which traditionally operated outside of the supply chain management industry  but are now beginning to expand the scope of their operations to include supply chain related services 
increased competition could result in reduced revenues  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could damage the long term or short term prospects of our business 
our industry is consolidating and if we cannot gain sufficient market presence in our industry  we may not be able to compete successfully against larger  global companies in our industry 
there currently is a marked trend within our industry toward consolidation of niche players into larger companies which are attempting to increase their global operations through the acquisition of freight forwarders and contract logistics providers 
if we cannot gain sufficient market presence in our industry through internal expansion and additional acquisitions  we may not be able to compete successfully against larger  global companies in our industry 
we are dependent on key management personnel and the loss of any such personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
our future performance depends  in significant part  upon the continued service of our key management personnel  including roger macfarlane chief executive officer  matthys wessels chairman of the board and chief executive officer african region  alan draper executive vice president and president asia pacific region and lawrence samuels senior vice president finance  chief financial officer and secretary 
there can be no assurance that we can retain such key managerial employees 
the unplanned loss of the services of one or more of these or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  peter thorrington  our president and chief operating officer  announced his intention in december to retire during fiscal no assurances can be given that we will be able to find a replacement with the operating experience and skills of mr 
thorrington 
we must continue to develop and retain a core group of management personnel and address issues of succession planning if we are to realize our goal of growing our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts 
because we are a holding company  we are financially dependent on receiving distributions from our subsidiaries and we could be harmed if such distributions could not be made in the future 
we are a holding company and all of our operations are conducted through subsidiaries 
consequently  we rely on dividends or advances from our subsidiaries including those that are wholly owned to meet our financial obligations and to pay dividends on our ordinary shares 
the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us and our ability to receive distributions on our investments in other entities is subject to applicable local law and other restrictions including  but not limited to  applicable tax laws and limitations contained in some of our bank credit facilities 
such laws and restrictions could limit the payment of dividends and distributions to us which would restrict our ability to continue operations 

table of contents because we manage our business on a decentralized basis  our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent management practices 
we manage our business on a decentralized basis  with local and regional management retaining responsibility for day to day operations  profitability and the growth of the business 
our decentralized operating strategy can make it difficult for us to implement strategic decisions and coordinated procedures throughout our global operations 
in addition  many of our subsidiaries operate with management  sales and support personnel that may be insufficient to support growth in their respective businesses without significant central oversight and coordination 
our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent management practices and materially adversely affect our overall profitability  and ultimately our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
we may need additional financing to fund our operations and finance our growth  and we may not be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may require additional financing to fund our operations and our current plans for expansion 
because our credit facilities often are limited to the country in which the facility is originated  we may require additional financing to fund our operations in countries in which we do not have existing credit facilities 
in addition  when our existing credit facilities expire  we may need to obtain replacement financing 
additional or replacement financing may involve incurring debt or selling equity securities 
there can be no assurance that additional or replacement financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we incur debt  the risks associated with our business could increase 
if we raise capital through the sale of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our shareholders will be diluted 
in addition  any new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our ordinary shares 
if we are unable to obtain additional or replacement financing  our ability to fund our operations and meet our current plans for expansion will be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to develop and integrate information technology systems or we fail to upgrade or replace our information technology systems to handle increased volumes and levels of complexity  meet the demands of our customers and protect against disruptions of our operations  we may lose inventory items  orders or customers  which could seriously harm our business 
increasingly  we compete for customers based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the information technology systems supporting our services 
the failure of the hardware or software that supports our information technology systems  the loss of data contained in the systems  or the inability to access or interact with our web site or connect electronically  could significantly disrupt our operations  prevent customers from making orders  or cause us to lose inventory items  orders or customers 
if our information technology systems are unable to handle additional volume for our operations as our business and scope of services grow  our service levels  operating efficiency and future transaction volumes will decline 
in addition  we expect customers to continue to demand more sophisticated  fully integrated information technology systems from their supply chain services providers 
if we fail to hire qualified persons to implement  maintain and protect our information technology systems or we fail to upgrade or replace our information technology systems to handle increased volumes and levels of complexity  meet the demands of our customers and protect against disruptions of our operations  we may lose inventory items  orders or customers  which could seriously harm our business 
our information technology systems are subject to risks which we cannot control 
our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers  web browsers  telephone systems and other aspects of the internet infrastructure which have experienced significant system failures and electrical outages in the past 
our systems are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
the occurrence of any of these events could disrupt or damage our 
table of contents information technology systems and inhibit our internal operations  our ability to provide services to our customers and the ability of our customers to access our information technology systems 
we may be adversely affected if we are unable to license the software necessary for our information technology system 
we license a variety of software which is used in our proprietary information technology system which we call empower as a result  the success and functionality of our information technology system is dependent upon our ability to continue our licenses for this software 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these licenses or replace the functionality provided by this software on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
the failure to maintain these licenses or a significant delay in the replacement of this software could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  the value of such rights may diminish and our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
these protections may not be sufficient  and they do not prevent independent third party development of competitive products or services 
further  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect our intellectual property rights could result in the loss or diminution in value of such rights 
if we are not able to limit our liability for customers claims through contract terms and the purchase of insurance  we could be required to pay large amounts to our customers as compensation for their claims and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in general  we limit by contract our liability to our customers for loss or damage to their goods to per kilogram approximately per pound for airfreight shipments and per carton or customary unit  including an ocean container  for ocean freight shipments  with the actual insured amount determined based on the value of the freight 
however  because a freight forwarder s relationship to an airline or ocean carrier is that of a shipper to a carrier  the airline or ocean carrier generally assumes the same responsibility to us as we assume to our customers 
when we act in the capacity of an authorized agent for an air or ocean carrier  the carrier  rather than we  assumes liability for the safe delivery of the customer s cargo to its ultimate destination 
we have  from time to time  made payments to our customers for claims related to our services 
should we experience an increase in the number of such claims or an increase in liability pursuant to claims or unfavorable resolutions of claims  our results could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will provide us with adequate coverage for such claims or that the maximum amounts for which we are liable in connection with our services will not change in the future 
in addition  significant increases in insurance costs could reduce our profitability 
the failure of our policies and procedures which are designed to prevent the unlawful transportation or storage of hazardous  explosive or illegal materials could subject us to large fines  penalties or lawsuits 
we are subject to a broad range of foreign and domestic including state and local environmental  health and safety and criminal laws and regulations  including those governing discharges into the air and water  the storage  handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the shipment of explosive or illegal substances 
in the course of our operations  we may be asked to arrange for the storage or transportation of substances defined as hazardous under applicable laws 
as is the case with any such operation  if a release of hazardous substances occurs on or from our facilities or from the transporter  we may be required to participate in the remedy of  or otherwise bear liability for  such release or be subject to claims from third parties whose property or person is injured by the release 
in addition  if our employees arrange for the storage or transportation of hazardous  explosive or illegal materials in violation of applicable laws or regulations  we may face civil or criminal fines or penalties  including bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas 
in the event we are found to not be in compliance with applicable environmental  health and safety laws and regulations or there is a future finding that our policies and procedures fail to satisfy requisite 
table of contents minimum safeguards or otherwise do not comply with applicable laws or regulations  we could be subject to large fines  penalties or lawsuits 
if we fail to comply with applicable governmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or revocation of our permits and licenses 
our air transportation activities in the united states are subject to regulation by the department of transportation as an indirect air carrier and by the federal aviation administration faa 
we are also subject to security measures and strict shipper and customer classifications by the new transportation security administration tsa and the faa 
we anticipate new security requirements regarding the handling of airfreight in the near term 
our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation  as necessary 
we are accredited in each of our offices by the international air transport association iata or the cargo network services corporation  a subsidiary of the iata  as a registered agent 
our indirect air carrier status is also subject to the indirect air carrier standard security program administered by the tsa 
we are licensed as a customs broker by the united states customs service of the department of the treasury in each united states customs district in which we do business 
all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by the united states customs service 
as a certified party under the self policing customs trade partnership against terrorism  we are also subject to compliance with security regulations within the trade environment that are enforced by the united states customs service 
we are also subject to regulations under the container security initiative  which is administered by the united states customs service 
our foreign customs brokerage operations are licensed in and subject to the regulations of their respective countries 
we are licensed as an ocean freight forwarder by and registered as an ocean transportation intermediary with the federal maritime commission 
the federal maritime commission has established qualifications for shipping agents  including surety bonding requirements 
the federal maritime commission also is responsible for the economic regulation of non vessel operating common carriers that contract for space and sell that space to commercial shippers and other non vessel operating common carriers for freight originating or terminating in the united states 
to comply with these economic regulations  vessel operators and non vessel operating common carriers are required to publish tariffs that establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states 
the federal maritime commission has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 
for ocean shipments not originating or terminating in the united states  the applicable regulations and licensing requirements typically are less stringent than those that do originate or terminate in the united states 
as part of our contract logistics services  we operate owned and leased warehouse facilities 
our operations at these facilities include both warehousing and distribution services  and we are subject to various federal and state environmental  work safety and hazardous materials regulations 
we may experience an increase in operating costs  such as costs for security  as a result of governmental regulations that have been and will be adopted in response to terrorist activities and potential terrorist activities 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to pass these increased costs on to our customers in the form of rate increases or surcharges 
we cannot predict what impact future regulations may have on our business 
our failure to maintain required permits or licenses  or to comply with applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses 
if we are not able to sell container space that we purchase from ocean shipping lines and capacity that we charter from our carriers  we will not be able to recover our out of pocket costs and our profitability may suffer 
as an indirect ocean carrier or non vessel operating common carrier  we contract with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at variable rates 
as an airfreight forwarder  we occasionally charter aircraft capacity to meet peak season volume increases for our customers  particularly in hong kong and other locations in asia 
we then solicit freight from our customers to fill the ocean containers and air charter capacity 
when we contract with 
table of contents ocean shipping lines to obtain containers and with air carriers to obtain charter aircraft capacity  we become obligated to pay for the container space or charter aircraft capacity that we purchase 
if we are not able to sell all of our purchased container space or charter aircraft capacity  we will not be able to recover our out of pocket costs for such purchase of container space or charter aircraft capacity 
if we lose certain of our contract logistics customers or we cannot maintain adequate levels of utilization in our shared warehouses  then we may experience revenue losses and decreased profitability 
we anticipate that revenues from our contract logistics services will account for an increasing portion of our consolidated revenues and may continue to increase as we further develop and expand our contract logistics  distribution and outsourcing services 
in some cases  we have entered into long term commitments for facilities 
we lease single tenant warehouses and distribution facilities  which represent in the aggregate approximately  square feet  under leases with terms longer than the logistics services contracts we have with our customers 
we are required to pay rent under these real property leases even if such customers decide not to renew or otherwise terminate their agreements with us and we are not able to obtain new customers for these facilities 
as a result  our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we experience a decline in demand for space in our shared warehouses  then our revenues and earnings may decline as we would continue to be obligated to pay the full amount of the underlying leases 
if we are not reimbursed for amounts which we advance for our customers  our net revenue and profitability may decrease 
we make significant disbursements on behalf of our customers for transportation costs concerning collect freight and customs duties and taxes and in connection with our performance of other contract logistics services 
the billings to our customers for these disbursements may be several times larger than the amount of revenue and fees derived from these transactions 
if we are unable to recover a significant portion of these disbursements or if our customers do not reimburse us for a substantial amount of these disbursements in a timely manner  we may experience net revenue losses and decreased profitability 
our executive officers  directors and principal shareholders control a significant portion of our shares and their interests may be different than or conflict with yours 
our current executive officers  directors and principal shareholders and their respective affiliates control a significant portion of our ordinary shares 
as a result  these shareholders may be able to influence us and our affairs  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of our company  and make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these shareholders 
these transactions might include proxy contests  mergers  tender offers  open market purchase programs or other purchases of our ordinary shares that could give our shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our ordinary shares 
it may be difficult for our shareholders to effect service of process and enforce judgments obtained in united states courts against us or our directors and executive officers who reside outside of the united states 
we are incorporated in the british virgin islands 
several of our directors and executive officers reside outside the united states  and a majority of our assets are located outside the united states 
as a result  we have been advised by legal counsel in the british virgin islands that it may be difficult or impossible for our shareholders to effect service of process upon  or to enforce judgments obtained in united states courts against  us or our directors and executive officers  including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 

table of contents because we are incorporated under the laws of the british virgin islands  it may be more difficult for our shareholders to protect their rights than it would be for a shareholder of a corporation incorporated in another jurisdiction 
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the international business companies act of the british virgin islands
