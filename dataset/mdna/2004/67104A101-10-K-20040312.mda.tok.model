item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world  with seven restaurant concepts  over  system wide restaurants and annual revenues for company owned stores exceeding billion 
we operate in all states and in countries internationally  predominantly through company owned stores  but we also operate under a variety of partnerships and franchises 
our primary focus as a company of restaurants is to provide a quality product coupled with quality service across all of our brands 
this goal entails offering consumers of different demographic backgrounds an array of dining alternatives suited for differing needs 
our sales are primarily generated through a diverse customer base  which includes people eating in our restaurants as regular casual users who return for meals several times a week or on special occasions such as birthday parties  private events  and for business entertainment 
secondarily  we generate revenues through sale of franchises and ongoing royalties as well as the sale and redemption of gift certificates 
the restaurant industry is a highly competitive and fragmented business  which is subject to sensitivity in economic turns  trends in lifestyles and fluctuating costs 
operating margins for restaurants are susceptible to fluctuations in prices of commodities  which include among other things  beef  chicken  seafood  butter  cheese  produce and other necessities to operate a store like natural gas or other energy supplies 
additionally  the restaurant industry is characterized by a high initial capital investment  coupled with high labor costs 
the combination of these factors correlates with our initiatives to drive increased sales at existing stores in order to raise margins  because the incremental sales contribution to margins from every additional dollar of sales above the minimum costs required to open  staff and operate a store is very high 
we are not a company focused on growth in the number of restaurants just to generate additional sales 
our expansion and operation strategies are to balance investment costs and the economic factors of operation  in order to generate reasonable  sustainable margins from our restaurant concepts 
promotion of our outback steakhouse and carrabba s italian grill restaurants is assisted by the use of use of national broadcast and spot television and radio media  which we will also begin to use for our bonefish grill brand 
we advertise on television in spot markets when our brands achieve sufficient penetration to make a meaningful broadcast schedule affordable 
we rely on word of mouth customer experience  grassroots marketing in local venues  direct mail and national print media to support broadcast media and as the primary campaigns for our upscale casual and newer brands 
we do not run price specials or attempt to lure customers with discounts  as is common to many restaurants in the casual dining industry 
our advertising dollars are meant to maintain brand image and develop consumer awareness 
we strive to drive sales through excellence in execution rather than through discounting and other short lived marketing efforts 
our marketing strategy of getting people to visit frequently and tell others about it complements what we believe are the fundamental elements of success convenient sites  service oriented employees  and flawless execution in a well managed restaurant 
key factors which can be used in evaluating and understanding our restaurants and assessing our business include the following average unit volumes a per store calculated average sales amount  which helps us gauge the changes in consumer traffic  pricing and development of the brand  operating margins store revenues after deduction of the main store level operating costs including cost of sales  restaurant operating expenses  and labor and related costs  system wide sales a total sales volume for all company owned  franchise  and unconsolidated joint venture stores  regardless of ownership to interpret the health of our brands  and same store or comparable sales a year over year comparison of sales volumes for stores that are open in order to remove the impact of new openings in comparing the operations of existing stores 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our financial results included growth of consolidated revenues by to billion  growth of net income by to million  new unit openings across all brands  and average unit volume increases at all concepts  with the exception of bonefish grill 
sales increases were driven by new unit openings  as well as increases in average unit volumes  which were aided by the overall economic recovery and continued resurgence of sales in former high tech and telecom markets 
our strategy in the past year included expansion of our newer concepts  particularly fleming s prime steakhouse and wine bar and bonefish grill 
we also focused additional spending on prime time broadcast media for our core outback steakhouse brand 
curbside takeaway is an increasing percentage of our total sales  and is adding incrementally to our overall sales  while not significantly reducing in store visits 
our international outback steakhouse operations grew average unit volumes by and profits by  which was the result of targeted attempts to translate our brand into local consumer preferences  primarily in the asian markets 
south korea continues to be our largest and most profitable international region and will continue to be an opportunity for growth 
in  our results were impacted by the growth of our newer brands 
as we continue to develop and expand new restaurant concepts at different rates  our cost of sales  restaurant operating expenses  and income from operations change from the mix of brands in our portfolio with slightly different operating characteristics 
labor and related expenses are higher at our new format stores than have typically been experienced at outback steakhouses 
however  cost of sales at those stores is lower than those at outback 
these trends are expected to continue with our planned development of stores in our industry s challenges and risks include  but are not limited to  the potential for government regulation  the availability of employees  consumer perceptions regarding food safety and or the health benefits of certain types of food  including attitudes about alcohol consumption  economic conditions and commodity pricing 
we have provided information in our outlook section that outlines our current beliefs regarding the anticipated changes to our operations resulting from increased beef prices and other commodity costs  continued preopening expenses from the development of new restaurants and our expansion strategy  among other factors that may affect our results in introduction at december   outback steakhouse  inc and affiliates the company restaurant system included the following outback steakhouse  inc and affiliates domestic outback steakhouses international outback steakhouses carrabba s italian grills fleming s prime steakhouses roy s lee roy selmon s bonefish grills cheeseburger in paradise total company owned development joint venture franchise total company owned restaurants include restaurants owned by partnerships in which we are a general partner and joint ventures in which we are one of two members

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements 
property  fixtures and equipment property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
we expense repair and maintenance costs incurred to maintain the appearance and functionality of the restaurant that do not extend the useful life of any restaurant asset or are less than  depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives buildings and building improvements to years furniture and fixtures years equipment to years leasehold improvements to years our accounting policies regarding property  fixtures and equipment include certain management judgments and projections regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets and what constitutes increasing the value and useful life of existing assets 
these estimates  judgments and projections may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impairment of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in evaluating long lived restaurant assets for impairment  we consider a number of factors such as a restaurant sales trends  b local competition  c changing demographic profiles  d local economic conditions  e new laws and government regulations that adversely affect sales and profits  and f the ability to recruit and train skilled restaurant employees 
if the aforementioned factors indicate that we should review the carrying value of the restaurant s long lived assets  we perform an impairment analysis 
identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of other assets and liabilities typically exist for land and buildings  and for combined fixtures  equipment and improvements for each restaurant 
if the total future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the carrying amount is written down to the estimated fair value  and a loss resulting from value impairment is recognized by a charge to earnings 
judgments and estimates made by us related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets are affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
insurance reserves we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability  health and property insurance programs 
we purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed in the following table workers compensation general liability health property coverage beginning in  for claims arising from liquor liability  there is an additional  deductible until a  aggregate has been met 
at that time  any claims arising from liquor liability revert to the general liability deductible 
beginning in  we are self insured for annual aggregate health insurance claims that exceed of estimates provided by our third party administrator and insurance company 
we record a liability for all unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by a third party administrator and insurance company 
our accounting policies regarding insurance reserves include certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices 
unanticipated changes in these factors may produce materially different amounts of expense that would be reported under these programs 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations revenue recognition we record revenues for normal recurring sales upon the performance of services 
revenues from the sales of franchises are recognized as income when we have substantially performed all of our material obligations under the franchise agreement 
continuing royalties  which are a percentage of net sales of franchised restaurants  are accrued as income when earned 
these revenues are included in the line other revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
unearned revenues primarily represent our liability for gift certificates that have been sold but not yet redeemed and are recorded at the anticipated redemption value 
when the gift certificates are redeemed  we recognize restaurant sales and reduce the related deferred liability 
employee partner stock buyout expense area operating partners are required to purchase a interest in the restaurants they develop for an initial investment of  this interest gives the area operating partner the right to receive a percentage of his or her restaurants annual cash flows for the duration of the agreement 
under the terms of these partners employment agreements  we have the option to purchase their interest after a five year period under the conditions of the agreement 
we estimate future purchases of area operating partners interests using current information on restaurant performance to calculate and record an accrued buyout liability in the line item partner deposit and accrued buyout liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
when partner buyouts occur  they are completed primarily through issuance of our common stock to the partner equivalent to the fair value of their interest 
in the period we complete the buyout  an adjustment is recorded to recognize any remaining expense associated with the purchase and reduce the related accrued buyout liability 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of outback steakhouse  inc and our affiliated partnerships in which we are a general partner and own a controlling financial interest 
the consolidated financial statements also include the accounts and operations of consolidated ventures in which we have a less than majority ownership 
we consolidate these ventures because we control the executive committee which functions as a board of directors or have control through representation on the committee by related parties and we are able to direct or cause the direction of management and operations on a day to day basis 
additionally  the majority of capital contributions made by partners in the consolidated ventures have been funded by loans to the partners either directly from us  or from a third party where we are required to be a guarantor of the debt  which provides us control through our collateral interest in the joint venture partners membership interests 
the portion of income or loss attributable to the minority interests  not to exceed the minority interest s equity in the consolidated entity  is eliminated in the line item in our consolidated statements of income entitled elimination of minority partners interest 
all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
outlook the following discussion of our future operating results and expansion strategy and other statements in this report that are not historical statements constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements represent our expectations or belief concerning future events and may be identified by words such as believes  anticipates  expects  plans  should  estimates and similar expressions 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statement 
we have endeavored to identify the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements in the section entitled cautionary statement on page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations future operating results revenue 
we plan to grow revenues in by opening additional restaurants and increasing comparable store sales in all brands 
our expansion plans are summarized in this section 
based upon current economic conditions  we are currently planning for average unit volumes for outback steakhouse to increase by approximately to during compared with at present  we are planning on price increases of in the first two quarters of and approximately for the second half of for outback steakhouse  compared with we are currently planning for average unit volumes for carrabba s italian grills to increase by approximately to during we are planning price increases of approximately during for carrabba s italian grills  compared with we are also currently planning for average unit volumes to increase by approximately to for fleming s prime steakhouse  to for roy s and to for bonefish grill 
we are currently planning price increases during of approximately for fleming s and approximately for bonefish  compared with we are not planning any price increases during for roy s 
we will reevaluate outback steakhouse  carrabba s  fleming s  roy s and bonefish s menu pricing periodically and may change prices as economic and commodity conditions dictate 
cost of sales 
based upon current and anticipated commodity markets  we are expecting unfavorable beef pricing versus  which will be offset by planned price increases and anticipated favorable pricing of certain other commodities  including produce 
the increase in cost of sales is also expected to be offset in as new format restaurants are developed that have a lower cost of sales as compared with outback and carrabba s 
although the total change in food cost is subject to several factors  such as the mix of new restaurants  commodity availability and usage and price fluctuations in commodities for which we do not have purchase contracts  the current expectation for us is for an increase of approximately to of sales for the full year 
labor costs 
we expect that as more of the new format restaurants roy s  fleming s and bonefish grills are opened  that consolidated labor costs as a percentage of consolidated restaurant sales will increase because the labor costs as a percentage of sales at the new restaurant formats run at a higher rate than at outback and carrabba s 
however  we anticipate increases in average unit volumes will leverage increased costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
as a result  we are currently planning for our labor costs to decrease by to of restaurant sales during restaurant operating expenses 
costs incurred prior to the opening of new restaurants are expected to increase as a result of additional restaurant openings in versus currently  we are planning approximately more new restaurant openings as compared to restaurants opened in these preopening expenses total approximately  for each company owned and joint venture outback steakhouse  approximately  for each carrabba s italian grill  approximately  for each bonefish grill  approximately  for each cheeseburger in paradise and approximately  to  for each new roy s and fleming s prime steakhouse and wine bar 
restaurant operating expense ratios may vary materially from quarter to quarter depending on when new units open 
as a result of an increase in planned openings of new restaurants and an increase in the proportion of new format restaurants and international outback steakhouses which have higher average restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales than domestic outback steakhouses and carrabba s italian grills  restaurant operating expenses may increase in by to of restaurant sales 
distribution expense to employee partners 
distribution expense to employee partners is affected by the number of cash buyouts of managing partners interests in their restaurants  average unit volumes  ownership percentage levels of our employee partners and operating margins across the consolidated brands 
we are currently planning for distribution expense as a percentage of total sales to decrease approximately in compared with 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations employee partner stock buyout expense 
the proportion of restaurants where the area operating partners interest is remaining to be purchased  the relative value of those interests  and the timing of buyouts all affect employee partner stock buyout expense 
as a percentage of total sales  we currently anticipate expenses recorded in associated with accrued buyouts of our area operating partners to remain consistent with those experienced in depreciation and amortization 
we expect depreciation costs  which are directly affected by investment in fixed assets  to increase as we build new restaurants  improve and remodel existing restaurants and invest in technology 
as a result of planned development  we are currently expecting depreciation expense as a percentage of sales to range between flat and an increase of in general and administrative expenses 
based upon our current plan  we expect that total general and administrative costs will increase by up to in compared with expansion strategy our goal is to add new restaurants to the system during the following table presents a summary of the expected restaurant openings for the full year outback steakhouses domestic company owned to franchised to outback steakhouses international company owned to franchised to carrabba s italian grills company owned to fleming s prime steakhouse and wine bars company owned to bonefish grills company owned to franchised roy s company owned to cheeseburger in paradise company owned to paul lee s chinese kitchen company owned lee roy selmon s company owned we estimate that our capital expenditures for the development of new restaurants will be approximately  to  in and intend to finance the development with cash flows from operations and the revolving line of credit referred to above 
we anticipate that to of the company owned restaurants to be opened in will be free standing units 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following any statements regarding future sales  costs and expenses and gross profit percentages  any statements regarding the continuation of historical trends  any statements regarding the expected number of future restaurant openings and expected capital expenditures and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  should  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statements included in the discussion of future operating results and expansion strategy and elsewhere in this report as a result  among other things  of the following i the restaurant industry is a highly competitive industry with many well established competitors  ii our results can be impacted by changes in consumer tastes and the level of consumer acceptance of our restaurant concepts  local  regional and national economic conditions  the seasonality of our business  demographic trends  traffic patterns  change in consumer dietary habits  employee availability  the cost of advertising and media  government actions and policies  inflation  and increases in various costs  iii consumer perception of food safety  iv our ability to expand is dependent upon various factors such as the availability of attractive sites for new restaurants  ability to obtain appropriate real estate sites at acceptable prices  ability to obtain all required governmental permits including zoning approvals and liquor licenses on a timely basis  impact of government moratoriums or approval processes  which could result in significant delays  ability to obtain all necessary contractors and subcontractors  union activities such as picketing and hand billing that could delay construction  the ability to generate or borrow funds  the ability to negotiate suitable lease terms and the ability to recruit and train skilled management and restaurant employees  v price and availability of commodities  including  but not limited to  items such as beef  chicken  shrimp  pork  seafood  dairy  potatoes  onions and energy supplies are subject to fluctuation and could increase or decrease more than we expect  and or vi weather and other acts of god could result in construction delays and also adversely affect the results of one or more stores for an indeterminate amount of time 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations impact of inflation we have not operated in a highly inflationary period and do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on sales or expenses during the last three years other than labor costs 
our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions  overtime and tip credits 
significant numbers of our food service and preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the federal and or state minimum wage and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs in the last three years 
to the extent permitted by competition  we have mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
at december   outstanding borrowings under our revolving lines of credit bear interest at basis points over the   or london interbank offered rate 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the  outstanding balance under these lines at december  was 
at december   outstanding borrowings under our japanese revolving line of credit bear interest at  or basis points over the london interbank offered rate 
the weighted average effective interest rate on the approximately  outstanding balance at december  was 
notes payable of approximately  to japanese banks bear interest at rates ranging from to at december  notes payable of approximately  to korean banks bear interest at rates ranging from to at december our debt balance did not exceed  for the years ending december  and at december   our total debt was approximately  should interest rates based on our average borrowings of approximately  through december  increase by one percentage point  our estimated annual interest expense would increase by approximately  over amounts reported for the year ended december  our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations relates primarily to our direct investment in restaurants in korea  hong kong  japan  the philippines and brazil  our outstanding debt to japanese and korean banks of approximately  and  respectively  at december  and to our royalties from international franchisees in countries 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate changes 
our investments in these countries totaled approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively 
many of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
although we attempt to minimize the effect of price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients  there are no established fixed price markets for certain commodities such as produce and wild fish and we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities 
other commodities are purchased based upon negotiated price ranges established with vendors with reference to the fluctuating market prices 
the related agreements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors and caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid 
extreme changes in commodity prices and or long term changes could affect our financial results adversely  although any changes in commodity prices would affect our competitors at about the same time as us 
we expect that in most cases increased commodity prices could be passed through to our consumers via increases in menu prices 
however  if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or  if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases  our short term financial results could be negatively affected 
additionally  from time to time  competitive circumstances could limit menu price flexibility  and in those cases margins would be negatively impacted by increased commodity prices 
in addition to the market risks identified above and to the risks discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon four vendors 
we currently purchase approximately of our beef from the two largest beef suppliers in the country 
if these vendors were unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts  we would encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in domestic and global financial markets
