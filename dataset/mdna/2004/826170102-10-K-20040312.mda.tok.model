this executive summary should be read in connection with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this item  the section below in this item entitled risk factors  and our consolidated financial statements  which are included following item of this annual report 
overview of our business and products we are a leading provider of business applications software 
substantially all of our revenues are derived directly or indirectly from a perpetual license of our software products 
specifically  we license our software solutions in multi element arrangements that include a combination of our software  customer support and or professional services eg  training or implementation services 
payment terms for our customer arrangements are negotiated with the individual customer and determined based on a variety of factors  including the customer s credit standing and our history with the customer 
our software applications enable an organization to better manage its relationships with its customers  partners and employees 
a substantial portion of our software license revenue is derived from our customer relationship management  or crm  solutions  which provide organizations with an integrated approach to identifying  acquiring and retaining customers 
for example  our crm applications i provide sales organizations with a comprehensive view into the sales pipeline  enabling sales professionals to identify specific actions that will help them better manage opportunities to rapid closure  ii assist marketing organizations to increase campaign response rates and reduce customer acquisition costs  and iii assist service organizations to reduce response times with customers  improving customer satisfaction 
in addition to licensing our crm applications on a per user basis  we introduced siebel crm ondemand in the fourth quarter of siebel crm ondemand is a hosted software solution that provides crm functionality over the internet 
siebel crm ondemand is provided to our customers for a monthly per user subscription fee  with a typical contractual period of one year 
siebel crm ondemand allows our customers to implement crm software solutions quickly  easily and cost effectively 
siebel crm ondemand integrates with our on premise licensed suite of products  enabling organizations to deploy our solutions in any combination of online hosted or on premise delivery models 
in addition to our crm applications  we provide software solutions that help organizations manage their employee relationships  better analyze corporate and customer data  and lower the cost of integrating software applications 
specifically  our employee relationship management applications enable an organization to increase employee and organizational performance and improve employee satisfaction by aligning employee performance with corporate objectives and providing employees with the information resources they need to be successful 
our business intelligence otherwise known as analytics and integration software applications help organizations to more fully leverage the value of their corporate information 
specifically  our analytics applications make it possible to analyze large volumes of corporate data quickly and easily  while our integration applications allow organizations to share data and processes among different software applications 
our professional services and technical support organizations provide i implementation services ie  assistance with the integration of our software with the customers other software and hardware applications  ii training services for our customers regarding how to use our software  and iii customer support services  otherwise known as maintenance  which include technical support for the related software product and future product updates 
our professional services are typically provided over a period of three to six months subsequent to the licensing of our software and  accordingly  our professional services revenues vary directly with the levels of software license revenue generated in the preceding three to six month period 
substantially all of our professional service arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis 
maintenance is typically sold with the related software license for a period of one year and is renewable at the option of the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
our maintenance revenues depend upon both our ability to generate additional software license revenue and annual renewals of maintenance agreements by our existing customer base 
internal controls and corporate governance we have historically considered our internal controls over financial reporting a high priority and will continue to do so through a continual review of and resulting improvement in our internal controls 
for example  we have substantially completed the documentation and testing of our internal controls as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  or sox  as of december   a year prior to the date required for companies with a calendar year end 
based on the testing of our internal controls  we believe that our internal controls are functioning as designed and provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
with the work we have completed to date  we believe that we are well positioned for our auditors to issue their attestation report on our internal controls in in addition  we have formed an internal controls committee  comprised primarily of senior financial and legal personnel  which helps ensure our internal controls over financial reporting are complete  accurate and appropriately documented 
in addition to maintaining robust internal controls  we follow high professional standards in measuring and reporting our financial performance 
specifically  we have adopted a code of ethics for all of our employees and directors  which requires a high level of professionalism and ethical behavior 
we believe that our accounting policies are prudent and provide a clear view of our financial performance 
we utilize our internal audit function to help ensure that we follow these accounting policies and maintain our internal controls 
we have formed a disclosure committee  comprised primarily of senior financial and legal personnel  to help ensure the completeness and accuracy of our financial results and disclosures 
in addition  prior to the release of our financial results  key members of our management review our operating results and key accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee  which is comprised solely of independent members of our board of directors 
please refer to the section entitled item directors and executive officers of the registrant of this annual report for a further discussion of our policies regarding corporate governance and our code of ethics 
operating environment and key factors impacting our results our operating results for were impacted by several factors  including macro economic conditions  economic conditions in the information technology industry and a general cautiousness and uncertainty within the application software industry 
in addition  we have carefully reviewed our own performance and taken steps that we believe will improve our performance  even in difficult macro and micro economic environments 
for example  as discussed further below  we completed a further restructuring of our operations during that we believe will i strengthen our competitive position  ii reduce our cost structure  thereby improving our revenue per employee  operating margin and overall operating performance  and iii better align our management and organizational structure in order to return to sequential quarterly revenue growth 
our operating results for were comprised of two distinct periods i the first half of  which was characterized by declining sequential quarterly software license revenues and declining operating margins  and ii the second half of  which was characterized by stabilizing revenue in the third quarter and increasing sequential quarterly software license revenues in the fourth quarter  improvement in operating margin and many of our key financial metrics  and a general growth in our operations  as discussed further below 
the following is a brief summary of some of the key factors impacting our operating performance during the economy we believe that much of the dichotomy in our operating results for is attributable to economic factors  the decline in the stock market and the associated confidence of corporations in the global economy 
throughout and continuing through the first half of  economic conditions in many of the countries in which we operate either deteriorated or stabilized at depressed levels 
for instance  many of the leading economic indicators showed signs of weakness during this period  corporate and consumer confidence in the economy remained very cautious and unemployment in the united states reached a nine year high 
further  we believe that geopolitical uncertainties  including hostilities involving the united states  exacerbated corporations general cautiousness in setting their capital spending budgets 
beginning in july and continuing throughout the second half of  economic conditions in many of the countries in which we operate began to show signs of strengthening 
for instance  corporate and consumer confidence in the economy improved  the us gross domestic product  or gdp  grew at annualized rate of over in the third quarter and over in the fourth quarter of  and the us department of labor continued to report an increase in the number of jobs created throughout the fourth quarter of our operating results mirrored the performance of the global economy 
specifically  many of our key financial metrics eg  software license revenues and operating margin were below our expectations in the first half of  but showed signs of strengthening in the second half  particularly the fourth quarter  of for example  our software license revenue increased sequentially by from the third to the fourth quarter of we also achieved an operating margin of in the fourth quarter  in advance of our previous expectations of achievement in late economic conditions in the information technology industry we believe that the weak economic conditions that persisted in the first half of disproportionately impacted the information technology industry in which we operate 
many corporations intensified their efforts to identify and realize potential cost savings in these difficult economic circumstances 
as a result  capital spending by corporations specifically information technology spending was delayed 
in addition  many corporations made capital expenditures in previous years in anticipation of future growth that did not materialize and  accordingly  these corporations have reduced their current capital expenditures until their operations return to positive growth 
as general economic conditions began to improve in the second half of  capital spending by corporations specifically information technology spending increased 
according to the us department of commerce  one of the major contributors to the increase in gdp in the second half of was purchases of equipment and software 
our operating results showed a similar improvement in the second half of as we began to see an increase in the number of companies evaluating their crm needs 
while it is still too early to determine if the recent improvement in both general economic conditions and information technology spending will continue  we believe demand levels may be stabilizing and may also be showing signs of returning to positive growth 
general cautiousness and uncertainty we believe that our results for much of were negatively impacted by the general cautiousness and uncertainty in the marketplace 
corporations monitored and continue to monitor global tensions and evaluate the potential for another significant terrorist attack 
further  during the first half of  several of our direct and indirect competitors announced their intention to merge or took steps to avoid being acquired by another competitor  which only intensified the uncertainty and cautiousness within the application software industry 
as a result  we believe technology spending and  more importantly application software spending  was negatively impacted during the first six to nine months of for example  a survey of information technology executives in mid indicated that of such executives had or intended to spend less than their full budget for capital expenditures in while this cautiousness and uncertainty within the economy negatively impacted our operating results in the first half of  we believe that the marketplace is generally becoming more cautiously optimistic due in part to a tentative economic recovery 
for example  recent surveys indicate a growing number of information technology executives plan to increase their company s spending on information technology 
once again  it is still too early to determine if this recent improvement will continue  but we are cautiously optimistic that our operating results may be showing signs of returning to positive growth 
summary of our operating results for and certain key financial metrics our operations and financial performance during the first half of were directly and negatively impacted by the factors discussed above 
specifically  many of our customers and potential customers i delayed the initiation of the purchasing process  ii increased the evaluation time of a software purchase  and or iii reduced their capital expenditure budgets  thereby restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs 
as a result of these and other factors  both the number of software license revenue transactions and average transaction size were negatively impacted during the first half of  with individual transactions generating license revenues greater than or equal to million affected to the greatest extent 
in order to reverse the decline in many of our key financial metrics  such as software license revenue  revenue per employee  and operating income  we took several steps to improve our operating performance and sales execution  including the following during and  we maintained many of our previously implemented cost controls 
specifically  management continued to reduce advertising expenditures  maintained our chief executive officer s salary at one dollar per year  deferred merit increases  and reduced discretionary expenditures  such as travel and recruiting 
during  we continued to reduce the discretionary portion of our operating costs through the implementation of various new cost control initiatives  including i tying bonuses more closely to the achievement of financial objectives  ii reducing depreciation  primarily through reduced capital expenditures  and iii instituting additional procedures to further reduce other discretionary expenditures  such as costs related to outside consultants  travel and recruiting 
through our continued evaluation of economic conditions in the information technology industry and based upon our expectations regarding revenue levels  we initiated a further restructuring of our operations in the second quarter of the restructuring 
the restructuring was in addition to the previously completed restructuring of our operations and an associated workforce reduction in the restructuring and collectively with the restructuring  the and restructurings 
we completed the restructuring in september in the second half of  we began the process of realigning our worldwide sales organization into three geographic operating units the americas  europe middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific 
we completed this realignment in early january and  accordingly  appointed one of our sales executives as the president of each of these geographical units 
each of these presidents report directly to our ceo 
due primarily to these actions  we were able to improve several key operating metrics 
key financial metrics for despite the difficult economic challenges faced throughout the first half of  we were able to improve several key financial metrics and performance indicators  particularly in the second half of the following is a brief summary of our key financial metrics and operating results for compared to  along with a quarterly trend analysis for year ended decemb er  year ended december  q q q q in thousands  except percentages and dso revenues software license revenues  maintenance revenues  professional services and other revenues  total revenues   costs and expenses restructuring and acquisition related expenses  all other costs and expenses   total costs and expenses   other key financial statistics operating income loss  operating margin cash and short term investments   days sales outstanding dso working capital   long term debt  total stockholders equity   cash flows from operations  please refer to restructuring and related expenses and purchased in process product development in the following pages for a further discussion of these expenses 
represents total cost of revenues  product development expense  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we believe these expenses are more representative of our on going operations 
the following is a brief discussion of the above financial metrics and an analysis of the reasons for the change between and  including recent trends in our results software license revenues decreased by from million in to million in  primarily due to the weakness in the global economy during the first half of  as well as heightened competition 
we have taken several steps to improve our ability to generate new software license revenues  including realigning our worldwide sales organization and implementing the restructuring  which we believe resulted in a more responsive management structure and more focused sales organization 
despite the decrease in software license revenues on a year over year basis in  several key software license metrics began to show signs of improvement  particularly in the second half of the following table highlights some of the trends regarding certain key software license metrics during in thousands  except number of transactions year en ded december  q q q q software license summary software license revenues  number of transactions greater than million number of transactions greater than million average transaction size annualized total revenue per employee our fourth quarter is impacted by seasonality because many of our customers utilize a significant portion of their capital budgets at the end of their fiscal year and the fourth quarter is the end of our sales quota year 
we believe seasonality only accounts for a portion of the increase in our results  as our software license revenues for the fourth quarter exceeded our previous expectations and historical increases from the third quarter 
for example  fourth quarter amounts exceeded third quarter amounts by in versus growth of in comparable periods in calculated as total revenue for the quarter divided by average employees for the quarter  the result of which is multiplied by four ie  four quarters to arrive at an annualized amount 
as the above table indicates  many of our software license metrics improved throughout the year  particularly in the second half of specifically  we were able to stabilize revenue in the third quarter and return our software license revenues to sequential quarterly growth in the fourth quarter of  increase the number of our significant transactions 
for example  the number of transactions generating software license revenue greater than million increased from two in each of the first two quarters of to three in the third quarter of and five in the fourth quarter of further  while the number of transactions generating software license revenue greater than million was consistent in both the first half and second half of transactions in each of these periods  a greater proportion of these transactions were in the to million range in the second half of compared to the first half of  increase the average software license transaction size throughout from  in the first quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of our best performance in over seven quarters  and increase our total revenue per employee throughout from  in the first quarter of to  in the fourth quarter of management believes much of this improvement is due to i an improving global economy  ii an increase in the number of customer evaluations of crm applications  with a conversion rate comparable to our historical win rates  iii the continued realignment of our worldwide sales organization  and iv some seasonality with respect to the fourth quarter 
while it is still too early to determine if this recent improvement will extend to  we believe that the above factors  coupled with our interactions with our customers  indicate that demand levels may be stabilizing or even showing signs of returning to positive growth 
maintenance revenues increased by from million in to million in  primarily due to stable renewal rates among our existing customer base and the new maintenance agreements entered into with new software licenses 
professional services and other revenues decreased by from million in to million in  primarily due to the previous declines in our software license revenues 
the majority of our professional services and other revenues relate to implementation and training services that we perform in connection with new software license transactions 
because these services are performed over a period of three to six months subsequent to the signing of the software license  trends in our professional services and other revenues generally follow trends in our software license revenues 
one of our primary goals for is to return our professional services organization to sequential quarterly growth as the year progresses ie  not in the first quarter of 
total revenue per employee increased from  per employee during to  per employee during calculated as total revenue for the year divided by average employees for the year 
in addition  as indicated previously  total revenue per employee increased sequentially in each quarter of this increase was primarily due to reductions in our employee base and the progressive improvement of the performance of our worldwide sales organization 
total quarterly costs and expenses decreased by approximately million  or  on a year over year basis based on a comparison of all other costs and expenses for the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of 
this decrease was primarily due to the and restructurings 
specifically  we exceeded our goal of million in expense savings from the restructuring compared to the second quarter of and achieved an additional approximately million in expense savings from the restructuring and other cost saving measures 
partially offsetting these cost savings were increases in compensation expense from merit increases and incentive compensation 
please refer to restructuring and related expenses in the following pages for a further discussion of the and restructurings 
targeted quarterly operating margin of  or million  was achieved in the fourth quarter of in advance of previous expectations 
this was our best performance in the last seven quarters 
we were able to achieve our midterm operating margin goal in advance of expectations due to improvement in our software license revenues and a significant reduction in quarterly expenses resulting from the and restructuring 
elimination of substantially all of our long term debt we redeemed our million convertible subordinated debentures the debentures on september  for million  eliminating substantially all of our long term debt and approximately million of annual interest expense 
cash and short term investments continued at over billion  with  million as of december   and  million as of december   representing approximately of total assets for each of these periods 
cash and short term investments decreased by million from to  primarily due to our redemption of the debentures for million and acquisition related expenditures of million primarily related to the acquisition of upshot corporation  which were partially offset by an increase of million from cash flows from operations 
increase in overall liquidity during the periods of weak global economic conditions from january  to december   in addition to paying off substantially all of our long term debt  we increased cash and short term investments by million  primarily through operations 
as the table of key financial metrics above illustrates  we generated positive cash flows from operations in every quarter during and a total of million for the year 
credit and collections days sales outstanding was days as of december  and days as of december  average payment terms on our software license revenue transactions decreased from days for to days for working capital was  million as of december  and  million as of december  the decrease was due to the redemption of the debentures and acquisition related expenditures  partially offset by our cash flows from operations 
with virtually no debt and a strong working capital position  we believe that we have the flexibility to continue to invest in further technology development and  when prudent  selectively acquire technologies or companies to strengthen our product portfolio 
stockholders equity increased from  million as of december   to  million as of december   primarily due to proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
stock option overhang  which represents the number of stock options outstanding relative to shares of common stock outstanding  decreased from as of december  to as of december  the decrease was due to a combination of actions taken by our management  including the option repurchase  cancellation for no consideration of certain stock options held by our ceo  forfeitures of stock options by employees upon termination  and reduced levels of new stock option grants during and key milestones achieved during the following is a discussion of several key non financial milestones that we achieved during industry analysts continued to acknowledge our product leadership 
for example  gartner  inc  a prominent information technology research firm  listed us in the leader quadrant position in four of its crm magic quadrant evaluations and rated us positive or strong positive in six of its marketscope research notes for the first half of the gartner magic quadrant and marketscope evaluations provide an objective and rigorous analysis of technology suppliers global capabilities  breadth and depth of functionality  proven scalability  technology innovation  company viability and vision  and their installed customer base 
overall  these reports assess a vendor s success in developing  selling  deploying  supporting and extending its applications 
we believe that we were able to maintain our market share at comparable levels to those achieved in in the majority of the product categories in which we operate and to continue as the technology leader in the crm market 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced siebel crm ondemand  a hosted crm service designed to allow organizations to generate more sales leads  enhance lead qualification and management  improve sales forecasting  shorten sales cycles and provide improved customer service 
to further complement our siebel crm ondemand product offering  we acquired upshot corporation upshot  a leading provider of hosted sales automation software applications  in november we continued our commitment to innovative product development with the announcement of our new crm for everyone product strategy 
crm for everyone encompasses new industry specific crm products  a new analytics platform and suite of analytics applications  new business integration solutions  and siebel crm ondemand 
in addition to our internal development efforts  we completed several key acquisitions during  the most significant of which was the acquisition of upshot 
in addition  we improved our portfolio of technology  both developed and in the process of development  with the acquisitions of certain technology related to our incentive compensation solutions  business analytics solutions and outbound messaging solutions 
our customer satisfaction levels continued at high levels  with an overall customer loyalty rating of  based on a survey conducted in the third quarter of customer loyalty is defined as customers who indicate they intend to continue using  upgrade to  and or purchase additional products from us

outlook for we intend to continue to work to improve the above financial metrics  including returning our software license and total revenues to sequential quarterly growth and year over year growth as the year progresses ie  not in the first quarter of 
although uncertainty in global economic conditions continues to make it difficult to predict product demand  we currently anticipate that our software license revenues will increase in compared to and that our maintenance revenues and professional services other revenues will remain comparable to or increase in compared to our ability to grow our maintenance and professional service revenues depends primarily on our ability to continue to grow our quarterly software license revenues 
as our software license revenues return to positive growth  we anticipate that our professional services revenue will also return to positive growth and our maintenance revenue will increase incrementally 
our expectations regarding our software license revenues may be negatively impacted by many factors  including i a deterioration in global economic conditions and or information technology spending  ii corporate and consumer confidence in the economy  iii additional terrorist attacks  iv geopolitical uncertainties  including continued hostilities involving the united states  v continued intense competition  including new technological innovations within our industry  vi the uncertainty in the application software industry and resulting reductions in capital expenditures  vii the loss of key employees  and viii other factors described under risk factors below 
we expect total costs and expenses excluding the significant unusual charges discussed above incurred in to remain comparable in to the levels in while we believe that the expense savings from the restructuring and our cost control initiatives will result in a significant decrease in our annual operating expenses from where operating expenses would have been absent the restructuring  we expect these cost savings to be offset or partially offset by i a renewal of merit increases for all employees  ii a growth in the number of employees in order to meet an anticipated increase in demand for our products and services  iii an increase in marketing expenditures  iv an increase in costs associated with our compliance with sox  and v an increase in expenses that vary directly with revenues  such as commissions  incentive compensation and bad debt expense  among others 
with regard to our cost savings  we achieved expense savings from the restructuring in the fourth quarter of as compared to the second quarter of in excess of our target of million and we expect to recognize up to an additional million of quarterly savings by the end of an aggregate decrease in excess of million in quarterly expenses from where operating expense would have been absent the restructuring 
we expect that in we will obtain additional cost savings from the restructuring  primarily from an anticipated decline in depreciation expense  decreases in facility related expenditures and additional savings from the relocation of a portion of our technical support  quality assurance and other product development operations to lower cost labor markets 
we believe these quarterly savings of million may be offset by increases in i compensation eg  increases in base compensation due to merit increases and the expansion of our workforce depending on revenue growth  along with increases in incentive compensation  ii marketing expenditures  and iii commissions  among other expense increases 
as a result of the anticipated increase in our revenues coupled with our continued expense controls  we expect operating income and margin to increase in from levels obtained in our expectations regarding operating income are directly dependent upon our ability to grow software license revenues 
our expectation regarding expenses  particularly certain marketing and compensation related expenses  and our operating margin may vary from the above expectations  depending in part on the level of revenue and profits 
specifically  our inability to estimate the timing and amount of our future revenues could significantly impact our future operations 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the estimated closing date and potential dollar amount of each transaction 
we aggregate these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluate the pipeline to identify trends in our business 
this pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period as the estimates and assumptions were made using the best available data at the time 
specifically  the slowdown in the global economy and information technology spending  among other factors  has caused and may continue to cause customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or canceled  all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  because a substantial portion of our software license contracts close in the latter part of a quarter  management may not be able to adjust our cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline  which may adversely and materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently expect our effective tax rate for to be approximately 
the estimated effective tax rate is based on current tax law and our expected income and may be affected by the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed and our ability to realize deferred tax assets 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  our us federal income tax returns for  and are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs 
during  we received notices from the irs of proposed adjustments to these tax returns 
while the final resolution of the irs s ongoing examination is uncertain  we believe that we have made adequate provision in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that the irs has or may propose with respect to our us federal income tax returns 
the final determination of our tax obligations may exceed the amounts provided by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we will continually review our estimates related to our income tax obligations  including potential assessments from the irs of additional taxes  penalties and or interest  and revise our estimates  if deemed necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to our income tax provision at the time of the change in our estimates 
such a revision could materially impact our effective tax rate  income tax provision  and net income 
discussion of the results of operations for each of the years ended december   and please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the section entitled application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates in the following pages for a description of our accounting policies and our use of estimates 
revenues our total revenues declined on a year over year basis during each of the last two years  declining from  million in to  million in and  million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased software license revenues and the resulting impact on our professional services revenues 
as more fully explained below  our software license revenues have decreased in each of the last two years primarily due to the weak economic conditions 
despite these weak economic conditions  we have taken several steps to improve our overall financial performance  including a realignment of our worldwide sales organization in the second half of and the completion of the and restructurings 
as a result of these efforts  we began to see improvement during of several of our key operating metrics 
for example  revenue per average employee increased from  per employee in to  per employee in  which is after a decline during from  in in addition  we achieved revenue per average employee of  in the fourth quarter of  which were levels that have not been obtained since the first quarter of while we do not expect to achieve the levels obtained in the fourth quarter for the full year primarily due to seasonality with respect to the fourth quarter of each year  we do expect to continue to improve this metric in from the  achieved for the full year the following is a discussion of each component of our total revenues 
software the following table sets forth our software license revenues in terms of absolute dollars  as a percentage of total revenues  and year over year changes to our software license revenues for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended decembe r  software license revenue metrics software license revenues   year over year change  absolute dollars   year over year change  percentage percentage of total revenues beginning in early and continuing through the first half of  our customers purchasing decisions were impacted by  among other factors i the overall weakness of the global economy and the resulting reductions in corporate capital expenditures  ii geopolitical uncertainties and the resulting impact on the global economy  iii uncertainties in the application software industry  and iv increased competitive dynamics in the crm application market 
accordingly  many of our customers and potential customers have i delayed the initiation of the purchasing process  ii increased the evaluation time to complete a software purchase  and or iii reduced their capital expenditure budgets  thereby restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs 
as a result of these and other factors  our software license revenues declined on a year over year basis during each of the last two years  with a decrease of in and in while we believe that each of the above factors has negatively impacted our software license revenues to an extent  we believe that the primary reason for this decline has been the weak global economy 
we believe that the uncertainty in the software industry and increased competition discussed previously had only an ancillary or modest impact on our sales pipeline  such as impacting the timing of the conversion of our sales pipeline 
for example  while competition within the crm industry has intensified in recent years  based on our review of market share data among the top five software vendors in the crm marketplace  we believe that we have maintained our market share at comparable levels with those in and in the majority of the product categories in which we operate 
accordingly  we believe that we continue to be a technology leader in the crm applications market 
because our software license revenues are recognized in close proximity to the license of our software and because our professional services and maintenance revenues are recognized as the services are performed typically three to six months after the licensing of our software  the above factors impacted our software license revenues sooner and to a greater extent than our professional services and other revenues 
accordingly  our software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues has declined in each of the last two years from and in and  respectively  to in to better understand the decline in our software license revenues  we have provided the following summary of certain key operating metrics that we use to track the progress of our software license revenues the number of transactions greater than million decreased from and in and  respectively  to in  the number of transactions greater than million decreased from and in and  respectively  to in  the total number of transactions decreased from  and  in and  respectively  to  in  and the average transaction size decreased from  and  in and  respectively  to  in as illustrated by the decrease in the number of our software license transactions from  in to  in  the downturn in the global economy has resulted in a significant decrease in the number of customers evaluating new information technology solutions 
the number of customer evaluations has decreased  and more significantly to us  the number of multi million dollar transactions ie  the transactions greater than million and million above and the average transaction size have declined in and we believe this occurred due to our customers restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs and reducing their capital expenditure budgets in order to reduce expenses and conserve cash in a weak global economy 
despite the decreases in these metrics  our customers continue to increase the deployment of previous purchases of our software  as evidenced by the increase in the number of deployed users from  at the beginning of to approximately million in despite the recent difficult economic times  we are committed to improving the performance of our sales operations and returning our software license revenues to positive sequential quarterly growth 
although our software license revenues decreased on a year over year basis  we have taken several steps in the latter part of and throughout that we believe will better position us for future growth  as follows as discussed previously  we have completed the realignment of our worldwide sales organization  which we believe will improve cross unit collaboration  better align our organizational structure with our go to market strategy  and empower local managers with increased authority and accountability 
further  we believe that the new organizational structure will allow greater responsiveness to customers  faster decision making and an improved focus of our resources on key growth areas 
we continued to increase the number of transactions from new customer projects  with  and of software license revenues in  and  respectively  coming from new customer projects 
we measure revenues from new customer projects based upon software license transactions from new customers  new divisions of existing customers and or new projects at existing customers 
we believe that the growth of our customer base will provide a competitive advantage through increased future sales opportunities when corporate capital expenditures return to normalized levels 
many smaller software providers that compete with us fell into financial difficulties during and as a result of what we believe to be the reluctance of customers to procure their software needs from a vendor lacking either a mature solution or secure financial outlook 
we believe that we are well positioned to offer the customers and potential customers of these vendors the software solution they need 
we believe we are beginning to see the benefits of these actions and an improving economy  as several key operating metrics improved sequentially during  particularly in the later part of the following table shows the recent trend in certain of our key financial metrics related to software license revenues in thousands  except number of transactions year e nded december  q q q q software license summary software license revenues  number of transactions greater than million number of transactions greater than million average transaction size annualized total revenue per employee our fourth quarter is impacted by seasonality in that many of our customers utilize a significant portion of their capital budgets at the end of their fiscal year and the fourth quarter is the end of our sales quota year 
seasonality only accounts for a portion of the increase in our results  as our software license revenues for the fourth quarter exceeded our previous expectations 
for example  fourth quarter amounts exceeded third quarter amounts by in versus growth of in comparable periods in calculated as total revenue for the quarter divided by average employees for the quarter and multiplying that result by four ie  four quarters to arrive at an annualized amount 
as the above table indicates  many of our software license metrics improved throughout the year  particularly in the second half of specifically  we were able to stabilize revenue in the third quarter and return our software license revenues to sequential quarterly growth in the fourth quarter of  increase the number of our higher dollar value transactions 
for example  the number of deals generating software license revenue greater than million increased from two in each of the first two quarters of to three in the third quarter of and five in the fourth quarter of further  while the number of transactions generating software license revenue greater than million was consistent in the first half and second half of transactions each  a greater proportion of these transactions were in the to million range in the second half of compared to the first half of  increase the average software license transaction size throughout from  in the first quarter to  in the fourth quarter our best performance in over seven quarters  and increase our total revenue per employee throughout from  in the first quarter to  in the fourth quarter  primarily due to the increase in software license revenue and the reduction in employees from the and restructurings 
management believes much of the improvement in these metrics was due to i an improving global economy  ii an increase in the number of customer evaluations of crm applications  iii the continued realignment of our worldwide sales organization  iv some seasonality with respect to the fourth quarter  and v greater breadth of our products and the strength of the industry specific versions of our products 
we market our products through our direct sales force and to a limited extent through distributors  primarily in europe  asia pacific  japan and latin america 
international license revenues accounted for  and of software license revenues in  and  respectively 
we expect international software license revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of our overall software license revenues in the foreseeable future 
because the majority of our software license arrangements and related operating activities are denominated in us dollars  foreign currency did have a significant impact on software license revenues  total revenues or net income for any period presented 
professional services  maintenance and other professional services  maintenance and other revenues are primarily comprised of professional services ie  implementation services and training and maintenance ie  technical support and product updates 
also included in professional services  maintenance and other revenues for is revenue from our newest product offering  siebel crm ondemand  which we introduced in the fourth quarter of the revenues derived from siebel crm ondemand were not significant for our professional services are typically provided over a period of three to six months subsequent to the licensing of our software and depend in large part upon our software license revenues 
our maintenance revenues depend upon both our software license revenues and renewals of maintenance agreements by our existing customer base 
the following table sets forth our professional services  maintenance and other revenues in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended d ecember  professional services  maintenance and other revenues maintenance   professional services and other   total   percentage of total revenues our professional services  maintenance and other revenues declined on a year over year basis by in and in due to a decrease in our implementation and training revenues ie  professional services revenues 
for example  professional services revenues decreased from to by million  or  and decreased from to by million  or  which we believe is due to the deteriorating economic conditions and resulting decline in software license revenues 
specifically  because our professional services revenues are typically provided over a period of three to six months subsequent to the initial software license  our implementation and training services depend on the amount of software license revenues generated in the preceding period 
therefore  a change in economic conditions will generally impact our software license revenues first and our professional services revenues shortly thereafter 
in addition  as customers continued to focus on reducing costs in difficult economic conditions  we have seen progressive pricing pressure on the rates we charge for our professional services resulting in a slight decrease in the overall hourly rate earned on our professional services in because our professional services and other revenues depend on our software license revenues in the preceding three to six month period  we currently expect professional services and other revenue to continue to decline on a sequential quarterly basis in the first quarter of however  if our software license revenues continue to improve as expected  we believe that our professional services and other revenue will return to positive growth shortly thereafter 
we are committed to improving the performance of our professional services organization and  accordingly  one of our primary goals for is to return our professional services revenue to sequential quarterly growth 
we took steps in the fourth quarter of to improve this performance and will continue to work to return our professional service revenues to positive growth throughout further  we are committed to realizing the benefits of these efforts in an expansion of our professional services margins  including  if necessary  further rationalizing our professional services headcount consistent with our revenue and gross margin goals 
despite our focus to grow our professional service revenues  we expect to balance our growth initiatives with our desire to manage our professional services organization to ensure that it does not compete with our implementation partners 
offsetting the decline in our professional service revenues were increases in our maintenance revenues that resulted from the continued growth of our installed customer base receiving maintenance 
specifically  maintenance revenues increased from to by million  or  and increased from to by million  or 
our maintenance revenues have increased on a year over year basis  primarily due to the renewal of customer maintenance agreements and the signing of new maintenance agreements at the time of a new software license 
however  primarily due to weak economic conditions  renewals of existing customers maintenance agreements have become more challenging  resulting in a slower growth rate in specifically  several of our customers have reduced the size of their employee base  thereby impacting the number of users of our software and the maintenance revenues derived therefrom 
we expect that our maintenance revenues will remain comparable to or increase in compared to the levels obtained in professional services  maintenance and other revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues during both and  primarily due to growth in the number of customers receiving maintenance  coupled with a comparatively sharper decrease in our software license revenues for the reasons described above

total cost of revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues primarily due to a decrease in the percentage of our revenues that was derived from software license revenues  which are at higher margins than our professional services  maintenance and other revenues 
please refer to the detailed discussion and analysis of each of these components of total cost of revenues below  which we believe will provide a better understanding of the changes within our total cost of revenues 
as discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we completed the option repurchase in included in total cost of revenues for is a compensation charge of million related to the repurchase of stock options held by our professional service and technical support personnel 
further  included in total cost of revenues for is a charge of million related to the abandonment of certain acquired technology obtained in the acquisition of sales

please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this abandonment 
we view these charges as significant special charges that make year over year comparisons of the costs incurred difficult 
the following is a discussion of the year over year changes within the individual components that comprise cost of revenues

  abandonment of acquired technology total   in connection with the restructuring  we performed an evaluation of our product lines and existing development efforts to determine if any products and or development efforts should be discontinued 
as a result of this evaluation  we determined that we would no longer utilize the technology ie  certain product modules and the remaining source code acquired through the acquisition of sales 
com 
in reaching this conclusion  we considered the following i our recently developed modules and functionality utilizing the jee platform were superior to the technology acquired from sales 
com  and ii our development resources would be more effectively utilized on other projects  particularly given the workforce reduction that occurred in the restructuring 
accordingly  we determined that the carrying value of the sales 
com acquired technology was no longer recoverable and therefore wrote off the remaining unamortized balance of million to cost of software license revenue upon abandonment in july this charge represented of software license revenues during based on our current evaluation of our acquired technology  we do not expect another charge related to our acquired technology in accordingly  we believe that the remaining costs included in total cost of software license revenues  as listed in the above table  are more representative of our on going operations 
cost of software license revenues  on going includes amortization of acquired technology  third party software royalties  and product packaging  production and documentation 
all costs incurred in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred 
cost of software license revenues  on going increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software license revenues from to primarily due to i an increase in amortization expense of million associated with the acquired technology obtained in the november acquisition of nquire software  inc  as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and ii a shift to products with higher third party royalties from products with either no royalty obligation or lower royalty rates 
cost of software license revenues  ongoing decreased in absolute dollars from to primarily due to i the decrease in software license revenues and ii a reduction of million from the cessation of amortization expense of the sales

included in total cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues for is a compensation charge of million related to the repurchase of stock options held by our professional service and technical support personnel 
as indicated in the above table  this charge represented of professional services  maintenance and other revenues during and resulted in a corresponding decline in our gross margin on professional services  maintenance and other revenues of two percentage points 
cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues  on going consist primarily of personnel  facilities and systems costs incurred to provide training  consulting and other global services 
these costs decreased by million  or  from to and decreased by million  or  from to these decreases were primarily due to i the reduction of headcount in response to the decrease in demand for our implementation services  ii partial realization of the cost savings from the and restructurings  including savings from the consolidation of our facilities and the reduction of approximately personnel in and personnel in  iii a reduction in the use of third party contractors  and iv the realization of savings from our cost control initiatives  including reductions of discretionary expenditures such as travel and entertainment 
partially offsetting these cost savings were increases in compensation costs from the renewal of merit increases and certain other incentive compensation 
cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues  on going as a percentage of the corresponding revenues decreased from in to in  primarily due to i the continued growth of our higher margin maintenance revenues  ii a higher utilization of our global services personnel  iii a reduction in the use of third party contractors  iv an acceleration of our cost control initiatives discussed above  and v partial realization of the cost savings from the restructuring 
primarily as a result of these factors  our gross margin as a percentage of professional services maintenance and other revenues improved from in to in ie  these factors accounted for a five percentage point improvement in our gross margin percentage during  which was partially offset by the two percentage point impact of the option repurchase discussed above 
cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues  on going represented of the corresponding revenues in both and while the above mentioned cost savings favorably impacted these costs as a percentage of professional services  maintenance and other revenues during  these benefits were offset by i an increase in compensation expense as a result of a renewal of merit increases and certain other incentive compensation  ii a decrease in revenue from licenses of our sales methodology experts formerly multi channel services products  which is included in other revenues and is at higher margins than maintenance and professional services  and iii a reduction in the rates that we were able to charge for our implementation services 
these same factors also negatively impacted our gross margin as a percentage of professional services  maintenance and other revenues during  as these factors offset the favorable impact of our cost control initiatives and the and restructurings 
the improvement in the gross margin as a percentage of professional services  maintenance and other revenues from in to in was primarily due to the absence of any charges related to stock options in versus a two percentage point negative impact from the option repurchase in operating expenses product development the following table sets forth a summary of certain components of our product development expense in absolute dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended d ecember  product development expense product development expense  on going   compensation related to option repurchase  total   included in product development expense for is a compensation charge of million related to the repurchase of stock options held by our product development personnel

product development expense  on going includes costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products  quality assurance activities and vertical engineering 
these costs consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits  consulting costs and the cost of software development tools and equipment 
product development expense  on going increased from to by million  or  primarily due to i our continued investment in the development of new products  new versions of our existing products and additional modules and ii an increase in depreciation of equipment utilized in our product development operations 
partially offsetting these increases were i expense savings from our cost control initiatives described above and ii partial realization of cost savings from the reduction of approximately product development personnel and consolidation of the remaining personnel into more highly utilized facilities in connection with the restructuring

partially offsetting these cost savings were i increased compensation costs from the renewal of merit increases and certain other incentive compensation  ii increased costs from outside consultants in connection with the further development of our latest products  uan and siebel crm ondemand  and iii product development expenditures from acquired companies please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
product development expense as a percentage of total revenues increased during each of the periods in the above table primarily as a result of our continued investment in the research and development of new products during a period in which our software license revenues decreased 
as noted above  the option repurchase accounted for an increase of one percentage point in in connection with the restructuring  we i discontinued certain development projects  ii initiated a transition of a portion of our quality assurance and testing activities overseas to labor markets with lower cost structures  and iii consolidated our product development management structure and eliminated nonessential development positions in order to better align our cost structure with expected revenues 
despite the reductions in personnel in our product development organization  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to develop new products and new versions of and additional modules for our existing products

sales and marketing expense  on going is comprised primarily of costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and consists primarily of i salaries  commissions and bonuses  ii facility related ie  rent and equipment related ie  depreciation expenses  iii travel and entertainment expenses  and iv promotional and advertising expenses 
these expenses decreased from to by million  or  and decreased from to by an additional million  or 
these decreases were primarily due to i the continued close monitoring of our expenses and further implementation of our cost control initiatives  including reductions in travel  entertainment  promotional and advertising expenditures  ii the decrease in sales commissions and other incentive compensation by million and million in and  respectively  that resulted from a decrease in our software license revenues  iii the reduction of expenses as a result of the restructuring  including the reduction of approximately sales and marketing personnel and consolidation of the remaining personnel into more highly utilized facilities  and iv the partial realization of costs savings from the restructuring  including the reduction of approximately sales and marketing personnel and consolidation of the remaining personnel into more highly utilized facilities 
partially offsetting these costs savings were increases in compensation expense associated with the renewal of certain incentive compensation plans and the renewal of merit compensation increases for some of our employees

this charge represented approximately of total revenues during and had a nominal impact on total general and administrative expense as a percentage of total revenues  as indicated in the above table 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of costs associated with our administrative personnel finance  information technology support  human resource and facility and executive personnel and consists primarily of salaries and occupancy costs  along with bad debt expense 
these expenses decreased from to by million  or  primarily due to i management s cost control initiatives described above  ii a million decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts associated with reduced receivable levels and an improved accounts receivable aging  iii the further reduction of expenses in the second half of as a result of the restructuring  including the reduction of approximately general and administrative personnel and consolidation of the remaining personnel into higher utilized facilities  and iv the elimination of the requirement to amortize goodwill in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
partially offsetting the decrease of general administrative expenses  on going during were increases in rent and depreciation expense 
general and administrative expenses  on going decreased from to by million  or  primarily due to i the further reduction of expenses as a result of the restructuring  including the reduction of approximately general and administrative personnel and the consolidation of the remaining personnel into higher utilized facilities  and ii the further reduction of our provision for doubtful accounts by million associated with reduced receivable levels  an improved accounts receivable aging and the recovery of certain receivables previously written off 
partially offsetting these cost savings were increases in legal expenses please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of legal proceedings  depreciation expense and compensation expense associated with the renewal of merit compensation increases and certain incentive compensation plans 
restructuring and related expenses as previously discussed  certain of our key operating metrics declined during and from their historical levels 
in response to this decline  we initiated a series of steps that we believe will i strengthen our competitive position  ii reduce our cost structure thereby improving our revenue per employee  operating margin and overall operating performance  and iii better align our management structure in order to return to sequential quarterly revenue growth 
specifically  we have taken the following actions we reduced the discretionary portion of our operating costs through various cost control initiatives discussed above 
in order to better align our operating structure with anticipated revenue levels  we initiated the restructuring  which we completed in december the restructuring consisted primarily of the consolidation of excess facilities  reductions in our workforce and the abandonment of certain assets in connection with the consolidation of excess facilities 
based on our continued evaluation of economic conditions in the information technology industry and our expectations regarding revenue levels  we initiated the restructuring in the second quarter of  which was completed in september the restructuring included the following key measures i the reduction of our workforce across all functional areas  including reductions related to the consolidation of our management organization and sales force organization  ii the consolidation of additional facilities  including ceasing operations in certain geographic locations  iii the abandonment of certain long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and iv the transfer of certain technical support  quality assurance and other product development positions overseas to labor markets with lower cost structures 
in addition to reducing our cost structure  we believe the restructuring will result in i a flatter  more responsive and efficient management reporting structure  ii a more focused sales organization providing greater responsiveness to customers and faster decision making  and iii a continued focus of our resources on key growth areas  such as our newest product offering  siebel crm ondemand 
the following table summarizes the expenses incurred in connection with the and restructurings  and the related obligations as of december  and in thousands employee facility asset termination related abandonment costs costs costs total restructuring obligations  july  restructuring and related expenses recognized in  cash payments  non cash charges restructuring obligations  december   restructuring and related expenses recognized in recognized related to changes in estimate  recognized related to the restructuring  accretion related to the restructuring total recognized in  cash payments  non cash charges restructuring obligations  december   less restructuring obligations  short term restructuring obligations  long term in connection with the restructuring  we reduced our workforce by approximately  employees  or of our then current workforce 
in connection with the restructuring  we reduced or expect to reduce our workforce by approximately employees  or of our then current workforce 
as of december   we had completed approximately of these terminations and expect to complete the reduction of the remaining employees within the next six months 
we have not completed the separation of employment with these remaining employees primarily due to regulatory requirements in certain countries and our ongoing transition of certain product development positions overseas 
the workforce reductions affected substantially all of our organizations and geographical regions 
the costs associated with our workforce reductions consist primarily of severance payments  cobra benefits  payroll taxes and other associated employment termination costs 
please refer to the section entitled critical accounting policies and use of estimates below for a further discussion of our accounting for these obligations 
as a result of the workforce reductions and previous employee attrition  certain of our facilities were under utilized 
accordingly  we consolidated our remaining workforce into under utilized facilities and ceased to utilize the then vacated facilities 
the facilities permanently removed from our operations during both and were located primarily in emeryville and san mateo  california  atlanta  georgia  europe  and several smaller offices in north america 
the costs associated with our facilities consolidation primarily relate to lease termination costs  costs associated with satisfying remaining lease commitments  and expected brokerage and other re letting costs  partially offset by estimated sublease income 
as part of the consolidation of our facilities  certain leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures were abandoned 
as a result  we recorded a non cash charge equal to the net book value of these abandoned assets in restructuring and related expenses 
we recorded restructuring and related expenses in an amount equal to the gross value of the related obligations without consideration to the net present value of such obligations 
in addition  in determining the restructuring obligations we assessed the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made 
primarily due to the real estate markets in which we operate remaining at depressed levels longer than originally anticipated  we extended the estimated sublease commencement dates and or reduced the estimated sublease rates on certain restructured properties 
partially offsetting these reductions in estimated sublease income were favorable changes in estimates that resulted from our i termination of certain leases at more favorable terms than originally anticipated and ii entering into subleases sooner than previously expected and or at higher sublease rates than originally anticipated on certain other restructured properties 
we believe that our estimates with respect to our remaining obligations related to the and restructurings are appropriate as of december  in accordance with sfas  we recorded the facility related expenses incurred in the restructuring after giving effect to the net present value of the related obligations 
represents the accretion of the restructuring obligations 
we will continue to accrete our obligations related to the restructuring to the then present value and  accordingly  will recognize additional accretion expense as a restructuring and related expense in future periods 
subject to the timely and successful implementation of the restructuring  we believe that the restructuring will further reduce our expense levels and a portion of the related cash requirements  resulting in a cost structure that is better aligned with anticipated revenues 
specifically  we expect the implementation of the restructuring  along with our cost control initiatives  will reduce our quarterly operating expenses by up to million from where operating expenses would have been absent the restructuring 
we achieved more than million of these expense savings in the fourth quarter of and expect to achieve the remaining expense savings by the end of the fourth quarter of the majority of the million in quarterly expense savings from the restructuring are expected to be derived from i our workforce reduction  including expense reductions related to employee compensation  employee benefits and other direct costs of up to million  ii a consolidation of our facilities  including reductions of rent and other operating costs of up to million  iii a decrease in depreciation expense of up to million  primarily due to reductions in capital expenditures  the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and certain property and equipment becoming fully depreciated  and iv a decrease in other operating costs of up to million  including savings from relocating a portion of our technical support  quality assurance and other product development operations to lower cost labor markets 
the total charge and related cash outlay related to the and restructurings are based on management s current estimates  which may change materially if further consolidations are required or if actual lease related expenditures or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
we will review the status of our obligations related to the and restructurings quarterly and  if appropriate  record changes in estimates related to these obligations in current operations 
because the benefits related to the restructuring are derived from management s estimates  which are based on currently available information  the restructuring may not achieve the benefits currently anticipated or on the timetable or at the level currently contemplated 
please refer to we may not be able to successfully implement our and restructurings  and such efforts may adversely impact our ability to retain and attract future employees under risk factors below for further discussion of the risks associated with the and restructurings 
purchased in process product development during we made selective acquisitions of certain assets primarily object and source code and other intellectual property in order to accelerate the development of selected projects in our product pipeline 
as described further below  we incurred an aggregate of million of purchased in process product development expense ipr d in connection with the acquisition of these technologies 
specifically  in order to further expand our entrance into the analytics market  we entered into a worldwide  royalty free perpetual license to certain technologies and intellectual property rights owned by a third party provider of analytic software solutions 
the license fee for this technology was approximately million 
we expect to continue the development of this technology  which we believe will result in a further expansion of our analytics suite  with the completion of the first products using this technology expected in the second half of because the technology obtained in this license had no alternative future uses  we have reflected the million ipr d charge in purchased in process product development expense during we expect to incur a minimum of an additional million of costs to further develop this technology and integrate it with our existing analytics technologies  which we believe may result in a new and enhanced suite of analytics products 
in october  we acquired certain assets primarily intellectual property of motiva  inc motiva  a provider of enterprise incentive management eim software  for total consideration of approximately million 
we expect the acquisition of these assets to accelerate our penetration of the eim market and expand customer choice in this market 
further  we believe that motiva s technology and the next generation of motiva s technology under development by motiva at the time of acquisition will enhance our current offerings in the eim market 
specifically  we believe the incorporation of motiva s services processing architecture will enable users of our siebel incentive compensation product to handle a much broader variety of compensation plans with greater flexibility and increased performance 
we are targeting availability for an enhanced integrated offering utilizing portions of the existing and under development motiva technology in the second half of substantially all of the assets acquired from motiva related to various forms of intellectual property ie  existing technology and technology under development 
the technology under development was approximately complete at the date of acquisition and we expect to incur up to an additional million to complete this development  with completion expected by the second half of based on our evaluation of the assets acquired  we allocated an aggregate of approximately million of the purchase price to ipr d at the date of acquisition 
because the ipr d acquired from motiva had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses  we have reflected the million in purchased in process product development expense for we determined the fair value of the ipr d based on the anticipated net cash flows from the anticipated future products  discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate of 
in calculating the value of amounts assigned to ipr d for all of our completed acquisitions during  we gave consideration to the relevant market sizes and growth factors of the technologies  our intended use of the products  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles  and the estimated lives of each of the products underlying technology 
the value assigned reflects the relative value and contribution of the ipr d 
we also gave consideration to the technology s stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed to date  the difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred  and the expected cost to complete the project 
given the uncertainties of the commercialization process  no assurance can be given that deviations from our estimates will not occur 
accordingly  there is risk associated with the realization of benefits related to commercialization of an in process project due to rapidly changing customer needs  the complexity of the technology and growing competitive pressures 
there can be no assurance that any project will meet commercial success 
failure to successfully commercialize an in process project would result in the loss of the expected economic return inherent in the fair value allocation 
in addition  we will periodically evaluate our product development timeline and modify our overall business plan in response to various factors 
modifications to our business plan may include the reallocation of resources among various alternative development projects 
operating income loss and operating margin operating income was million for  as compared to operating losses of million and million for and  respectively 
operating margin was in  as compared to negative operating margins of and in and  respectively 
we incurred negative operating income and margins during  primarily as the result of the restructuring and option repurchase  and incurred negative operating income and margins during  primarily due to the restructuring and the purchased in process development expense discussed above 
in addition to the decreases in operating income and margins due to these significant unusual expenses  our operating income and operating margin have also decreased in and due to i the year over year decrease in total revenues and ii the comparatively sharper decrease in software license revenues  which are at higher margins than professional services  maintenance and other revenues 
the decline in operating income and operating margins was partially offset by i management s cost control initiatives  ii the partial realization of the benefits of the and restructurings  and iii the elimination of the requirement to amortize goodwill  which totaled million during as a result of our restructuring efforts and our continued cost control efforts  we anticipate that our cost structure will be better aligned with our anticipated future revenue levels 
we believe that we are already seeing the benefits of these cost savings and improvement in our sales organization  as we achieved an operating margin of in the fourth quarter of  nearly a year in advance of previous expectations 
this was our best performance in seven quarters 
other income  net for  and  other income  net was comprised of the following in thousands year ended de cember  interest income   interest expense   loss on early extinguishment of debt net gains on marketable investments   write down of cost method investments   other  net   interest income represents earnings on our cash and short term investments 
interest income decreased from to and from to primarily due to a decline in interest rates  which was partially offset by an increase in the balances of our cash and short term investments primarily in and the first half of 
interest expense primarily represents interest on our million convertible subordinated debentures the debentures 
interest expense increased in from the levels in  primarily as the result of interest expense associated with an increase in our capital lease obligations 
interest expense decreased in primarily due to the redemption of the debentures in september  as discussed further below 
as described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we redeemed the debentures in accordance with their terms for million on september  in connection with this redemption  we incurred a pre tax charge to operations of million  consisting of the million premium and the write off of the remaining unamortized issuance costs of million 
this pre tax charge is reflected in the above table under the heading loss on early extinguishment of debt for during  and  net gains on marketable investments resulted primarily from sales of certain short term investments  partially offset by net write downs of million and million to our marketable equity securities in and  respectively  as the decline was determined to be other than temporary 
we hold several minority interests  included in other assets  in companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
write down of cost method investments in the above table represents adjustments to certain of these investments to the estimated fair value as the decline in these investments was deemed to be other than temporary 
other  net for all periods presented is primarily comprised of banking fees and foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
income taxes and income tax benefit income taxes totaled million for  as compared to an income tax benefit of million and million for and  respectively 
income taxes as a percentage of pretax income ie  the effective rate were in  as compared to an income tax benefit of in and please refer to notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the section entitled application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates in the following pages for description of our accounting policies and use of estimates related to our income tax provision and or income tax benefit 
liquidity and capital resources overview we derive our liquidity and capital resources primarily from our cash flows from operations and from our working capital 
our working capital decreased by  from  million as of december   to  million as of december  the decrease was primarily due to the redemption of the debentures  which was partially offset by our cash flows from operations 
with virtually no debt and a strong working capital position  we believe that we have the flexibility to continue to invest in further developing our technology and  when necessary or appropriate  make selective acquisitions to continue to strengthen our product portfolio 
the significant components of our working capital are liquid assets such as cash  short term investments and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued expenses  restructuring obligations and deferred revenue 
we continue to operate a cash positive business and  accordingly  we have been able to eliminate substantially all of our long term debt and maintain our cash and short term investment balances at over billion 
specifically  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  million and  million as of december  and  respectively  representing approximately of total assets as of these dates 
we also were able to keep our average payment terms related to our license transactions near the lowest levels in our history ie  days for 
the continued low payment terms on our license transactions assisted us in maintaining our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable at days as of december   as compared to days as of december   which are impacted by the linearity of our revenues  especially software license revenues and deferred revenues 
we believe our current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
our liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products  which are subject to rapid technological changes  or a reduction of capital expenditures by our customers as a result of a downturn in the global economy  among other factors 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during and do not currently anticipate repurchasing any of our common stock in commitments as of december   our future fixed commitments for cash payments are as follows in thousands pa yments due by year to to and contractual obligations beyond total operating lease obligations   capital lease obligations   restructuring obligations   other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet 
current liabilities reflected on the balance sheet  other purchase obligations   long term debt total fixed commitments   in connection with the and restructurings  we ceased to use certain of our facilities with noncancellable operating leases 
we have reflected the commitments related to these operating lease obligations in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  and in the above table under the heading restructuring obligations 
accordingly  operating lease obligations in the above table only include operating lease obligations related to our facilities and certain equipment that we continue to utilize in our operations 
please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a detailed summary of anticipated cash outlays related to our operating leases 
capital lease obligations in the above table represent the gross expected cash outlays and  therefore  do not represent their net present value as recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a detailed summary of anticipated cash outlays related to our capital leases 
the restructuring obligations in the above table represent our gross expected cash outlays related to the settlement of these obligations  primarily obligations related to noncancellable operating leases 
accordingly  the restructuring obligations in the above table have not been reduced by estimated sublease income of million nor have these obligations been reduced to their net present value as presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a detailed summary of our future commitments related to the and restructurings  including a detail of contractual obligations  estimated operating costs and estimated sublease income 
current liabilities in the above table represent current liabilities as presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  reduced by the current portion of capital lease obligations and restructuring obligations  as we have included the current portion of these obligations in separate line items in the above table 
other purchase obligations in the above table represent all open purchase orders for which we have not received the service or goods as of december  and  therefore  have not been included as a liability in the accompanying balance sheet 
the majority of our other purchase obligations relate to commitments related to telecommunication services 
as discussed above and further below  we believe that our current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet our cash needs for our daily operations and the above contractual obligations 
our objective is to maintain our cash and short term investments at or above billion in order to provide sufficient cash for our operations  including selective acquisitions 
cash flows as discussed above  one of the primary sources of our liquidity is our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations 
the following is a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash in our operating activities  along with significant sources and uses in our investing and financing activities operations cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
despite the weak economic conditions  we have continued to operate our business to produce positive cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operating activities decreased on a year over year basis during both and primarily as the result of decreases in revenues and earnings that occurred  in part  as a result of the weak global economic conditions 
during  and  our cash flows from operations were primarily derived from i our earnings from on going operations prior to non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  bad debt  and the non cash portion of our restructuring related expenses ie  asset abandonment write offs and option repurchase expenses  ii the tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock options  which reduces our cash outlay for income tax expense  and iii changes in our working capital  which is primarily composed of collections of accounts receivable and increases in restructuring obligations and deferred revenue  and partially offset by payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
because the majority of the restructuring obligations will be paid over time or do not involve cash outlays  cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and was only reduced by the million and million  respectively  of cash payments made during these periods related to these obligations 
as we settle our remaining restructuring obligations million as of december   our future operating cash flows will be reduced in the period of settlement 
we currently estimate that we will settle million of these obligations in we currently anticipate that we will continue to operate a cash positive business and as economic conditions improve return to sequential annual growth of cash flows from operations 
our ability to meet these expectations is directly dependent upon our ability to achieve positive earnings and maintain or increase the level of our software license revenues 
in addition  our ability to generate future cash flows from operations could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for our products  which are subject to rapid technological change  or a reduction of capital expenditures by our customers as a result of a downturn in the global economy  among other factors 
investing cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
during each of these periods  our investment activities primarily related to transactions within our short term investments 
for and  we reinvested our cash into short term investments in net amounts of million and million  respectively  as compared to net proceeds of million in from the sale of our short term investments 
we were able to continue to reinvest our cash positions in short term investments during and in increasing amounts  as the weakened economy had not impacted our cash flows to the same extent as our earnings 
during  we determined that it would be prudent to redeem our debentures for million  in part in order to realize savings of approximately million of annual interest expense 
accordingly  we sold a portion of our short term investments in in order to fund the redemption of the debentures 
accordingly  our cash used in investing activities decreased during from the levels in and primarily due to the redemption of the debentures  along with the continued decrease in our cash flows from operations historically reinvested in short term investments for the reasons described above 
we also utilize our cash positions to invest in new property and equipment  with purchases of property and equipment of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were significantly higher in compared to both and  primarily as a result of the following i the expansion of our infrastructure during to support the development and testing of siebel  ii the reduction of our information technology requirements for computers and other equipment in and due to a reduction of our employees from approximately  at the end of the first quarter of to approximately  at the end of  and iii the reduction in the number of offices we were occupying in and versus expansion of our facilities needs in  which allowed us to reduce the purchase of tenant improvements  furniture and fixtures 
in addition  in response to the weakening economy and as a part of our cost control initiatives  we reduced our capital expenditure budgets during  thereby reducing our capital expenditures 
we expect to continue to closely monitor our capital expenditures 
however  we currently expect our capital expenditures to increase in from levels incurred in as a result of our further investment in hosted crm infrastructure and spending to meet the information technology needs of an expanded workforce 
specifically  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in financing cash provided by financing activities was million and million for and  respectively  as compared to cash used in financing activities of million for the decrease of our financing activities from positive cash inflows in and to cash outflows during was due to our redemption of the debentures for cash consideration of million on september  for  and  our remaining financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  our financing activities for also included million of proceeds from an equipment financing 
these cash inflows from financing activities were partially offset during  and by our repayment of capital lease obligations  net of our collection of amounts due under stockholder notes during and off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are oftentimes referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
as of december   we leased facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases expiring between and rent expense under operating leases for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of december  are detailed previously in liquidity and capital resources in the section entitled commitments 
we sell our software licenses and services to our customers under contracts which we refer to as software license and service agreements  or slsa 
each slsa contains the relevant terms of the contractual arrangement with the customer  and generally includes provisions that indemnify the customer against losses  expenses  and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event our software is found to infringe upon a third party patent  copyright  trademark  or other proprietary right 
the slsa generally limits the scope of and remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects  including but not limited to certain time and geography based scope limitations and a right to replace an infringing product 
we believe our internal development processes and other policies and practices limit our exposure related to the indemnification provisions of the slsa 
in addition  we require our employees to sign a proprietary information and inventions agreement  which further protects our confidential and proprietary information and assigns the rights of our employees development work to us 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and we are not aware of any material claims 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and the application of gaap requires management to make estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns  fair value of investments  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  income taxes  restructuring obligations  and contingencies and litigation  among others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates  which are discussed further below 
critical accounting policies in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions eg  stock based compensation  restructuring activities  depreciation methodology  etc we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates revenue recognition  restructuring and related expenses  impairment of long lived assets  the provision for doubtful accounts  acquired intangible assets  stock based compensation  legal contingencies and income taxes 
our management has reviewed our critical accounting policies  our critical accounting estimates  and the related disclosures with our disclosure and audit committees 
these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described below 
in addition  please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further description of our accounting policies 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenues are derived primarily from providing i licenses of our software  ii technical support and product updates  otherwise known as maintenance  and iii professional services  including implementation and training services 
our standard end user license agreement provides for an initial fee for use of our products in perpetuity based upon the number of named users 
we license our software in multiple element arrangements in which the customer typically purchases a combination of i our software products  ii a maintenance arrangement  which is generally priced as a percentage of the software license fees for a period of one year  and iii a professional services arrangement on a time and materials basis 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the requirements of statement of position no 
software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements collectively sop  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license  maintenance and professional services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
under the residual method prescribed by sop  revenue is recognized when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  professional services and maintenance  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
each license arrangement requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each element 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we determine the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price of the maintenance charged to the customer based on full deployment of the licensed software products and the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement based on the hourly rates that we charge for these services when sold independently from a software license 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the period that these elements are delivered 
in addition to evaluating the fair value of each element of the arrangement  we consider whether the elements can be separated into separate accounting units under sop in making this determination  we consider the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
for substantially all of our software arrangements  we defer revenue for the fair value of the maintenance and professional services to be provided to the customer and recognize revenue for the software license when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery of the software has occurred  provided the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
we evaluate each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery delivery is considered to occur when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to download the licensed programs 
our typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenue from resellers upon sell through to the end customer 
fixed or determinable fee we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed and the credit standing of the individual customer  among other factors 
we generally consider payments that are due within six months to be fixed or determinable based upon our successful collection history on such arrangements and evaluate payment terms in excess of six months but less than one year on a case by case basis as to whether the fee is fixed or determinable 
in addition  we only consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is deemed probable we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue upon cash collection 
our customers typically pre pay maintenance for the first year in connection with a new software license  and the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the initial maintenance contract 
maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
professional services revenue primarily consists of implementation services related to the installation of our products and training revenues 
our software is ready to use by the customer upon receipt 
while many of our customers may choose to tailor the software to fit their specific needs  our implementation services do not involve significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
substantially all of our professional services arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and  accordingly  are recognized as the services are performed  which is typically over a three to six month period subsequent to the licensing of our software 
restructuring and related expenses during and  we initiated and completed two separate restructurings of operations  herein referred to as the restructuring and the restructuring 
we have accounted for the and restructurings in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
restructuring and impairment charges and other applicable accounting standards as discussed below 
in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs associated with a restructuring eitf and eitf issue no 
costs associated with lease modification or termination eitf 
we adopted sfas effective january   therefore  the restructuring was accounted for in accordance with sfas the adoption of sfas did not impact our restructuring obligations recognized in connection with the restructuring  as these obligations must continue to be accounted for in accordance with eitf and eitf and other applicable pre existing guidance 
the following is a summary of the accounting principles used to record and measure the and restructurings and the associated obligations restructuring the expenses incurred in connection with the restructuring are comprised primarily of i severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce  ii lease termination costs and or costs associated with ceasing to use certain facilities facilities abandonment  and iii impairment costs related to certain long lived assets abandoned 
as discussed above  we have accounted for the restructuring in accordance with sfas sfas requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan 
sfas also requires that i liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities be measured at fair value  ii one time termination benefits be expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee  unless the employee must provide future service  in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period  iii liabilities related to an operating lease contract be measured at fair value and recorded when the contract does not have any future economic benefit to the entity ie  the entity ceases to utilize the rights conveyed by the contract  and iv all other costs related to an exit or disposal activity be expensed as incurred 
in accordance with sfas  we accounted for the individual components of the restructuring as follows severance we have historically provided substantially the same termination benefits at the time of a non performance based workforce reduction and  as a result  we determined that the employee termination obligations incurred in connection with the restructuring did not meet the definition of a one time benefit arrangement under sfas accordingly  we have accounted for these employee termination obligations  with the exception of those created under labor law eg  the warn act  in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for postemployment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and we have accounted for employee termination obligations incurred in the restructuring under the warn act and local labor law in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
accordingly  we recorded the liability related to these termination costs when we determine that it is both probable and estimable  which is generally when i we approve a termination plan that commits us to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination  ii the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and their job classifications  and iii the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
facilities abandonment we accounted for the costs associated with lease termination and or abandonment in accordance with sfas accordingly  we recorded the costs associated with lease termination and or abandonment when we ceased to utilize the leased property 
under sfas  we measure the liability associated with lease termination and or abandonment as the present value of the total remaining lease costs and associated operating costs  less probable sublease income 
we will accrete our obligations related to the restructuring to the then present value and  accordingly  will recognize accretion expense as a restructuring and related expense in future periods 
asset impairment abandonment we accounted for costs related to the assets abandoned in connection with the restructuring in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas and  accordingly  charged to expense the net carrying value of the long lived assets when we abandoned the assets  primarily leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
please refer to impairment of long lived assets below for a further discussion of our accounting policy and related accounting estimates involved related to assessing whether an asset is impaired 
restructuring restructuring obligations incurred prior to the adoptions of sfas ie  the restructuring were accounted for and continue to be accounted for in accordance with eitf and eitf the expenses incurred in connection with the restructuring are comprised primarily of i severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce  ii lease termination costs and or costs associated with facilities abandonment  and iii impairment costs related to certain long lived assets abandoned 
we accounted for the individual components of the restructuring as follows severance we account for the costs associated with the reduction of our workforce in accordance with eitf accordingly  we recorded the liability related to these termination costs when i management with the appropriate level of authority approves a termination plan that commits us to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination  ii the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the termination benefits  iii the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and their job classifications  and iv the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
facilities abandonment we accounted for the costs associated with lease termination and or abandonment in accordance with eitf accordingly  we recorded the costs associated with lease termination and or abandonment when the leased property had no substantive future use or benefit to us 
under eitf  we recorded the liability associated with lease termination and or abandonment as the sum of the total remaining lease costs and related exit costs  less probable sublease income 
under eitf  we did not reduce our obligations associated with lease abandonment to the net present value of the remaining obligations 
asset impairment abandonment we accounted for costs related to the assets abandoned in connection with the restructuring in accordance with sfas and  accordingly  charged to expense the net carrying value of the long lived assets when we abandoned the assets  primarily leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the and restructurings are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities 
in determining the charge related to the and restructurings  we had to make significant estimates related to the expenses associated with our excess facilities 
for example  in determining the charge for excess facilities  we were required to estimate future sublease income including both timing and amount of the potential sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and potential brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates related to the timing and extent of future sublease income in which to reduce our lease obligations 
specifically  in determining our obligations related to facilities included in the and restructurings as of december   we reduced the estimated cash outflows related to these obligations by estimated sublease income of million 
we based our estimates of sublease income  in part  on the opinions of independent real estate experts  current market conditions and rental rates  the status of negotiations with potential subtenants  and the location of the respective facility  among other factors 
in addition  in determining the restructuring obligations we assessed the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made 
in addition to estimating sublease income  we also estimated the remaining operating costs eg  maintenance  utilities  property management fees  etc 
and estimated brokerage commissions of the facilities exited in connection with the and restructurings 
we based our estimates  in part  on the opinions of independent real estate experts  current operating expense levels in the individual facilities  an assessment of projected increases in those costs and the location of the respective facility  among other factors 
in determining the restructuring obligations we also assessed the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made 
as of december   we have estimated future operating costs and brokerage commissions for the facilities included in the and restructurings to be million 
these estimates  along with other estimates made by management in connection with the and restructurings  may vary significantly depending  in part  upon factors that may be beyond our control 
specifically  these estimates will depend on our success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to the facilities reserve will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
we have had and expect that we will continue to have adjustments to our estimates of our obligations recorded in connection with the and restructurings 
for example  during we revised our estimates related to obligations recorded in previous periods related to the and restructurings  resulting in an additional charge of million during while we believe our estimates related to our and restructuring obligations are appropriate as of december   if our estimates regarding sublease income  operating costs and brokerage commissions were to change by  we would be required to record an additional charge to our operations of approximately million in the period of such change in estimate 
we will continue to review the status of our and restructuring obligations on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to these obligations in current operations based on management s most current estimates 
impairment of long lived assets we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that we have only one reporting unit  specifically the license  implementation and support of our software applications 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually on july in a two step process 
first  we must determine if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
we evaluate all of our long lived assets primarily property and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
in accordance with sfas  when a long lived asset or intangible asset is abandoned  the carrying value is charged to expense in the period of abandonment 
during and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million associated with certain furniture  fixtures and leasehold improvements that we abandoned in connection with the and restructurings 
these assets  primarily leasehold improvements  were located in facilities that we ceased to use 
based on our evaluation of these assets we determined that the assets were not marketable for resale and oftentimes could not be removed from the premises eg  the asset consisted of a dividing wall or other permanent fixture 
in addition  based on our assessment that we would no longer be able to utilize the underlying source code or functionality of an acquired technology intangible asset obtained in connection with the acquisition of sales 
com  we recognized an impairment charge of million during as of december   the net carrying value of our leasehold improvements and intangible assets ie  the primary asset categories that we have experienced impairment charges in the past were million and million  respectively 
while we do not currently believe any of our long lived assets are impaired  and we do not anticipate an impairment in the near term  if a change in circumstances were to occur requiring an assessment of impairment  we would be required to evaluate whether the future cash flows related to the asset will be greater than its carrying value at the time of the impairment test 
while our cash flow assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our operations  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to our intangible assets over their respective estimated useful lives 
if such an evaluation resulted in an impairment of any of our long lived assets  such impairment would be recorded in the period we make the impairment determination 
provision for doubtful accounts we initially record our provision for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and then adjust this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  management considers i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable ie license  consulting  maintenance  etc  iv our historical provision for doubtful accounts  which have ranged on a quarterly basis up to of total revenues and on an annual basis between and of total revenues  v the credit worthiness of each customer  vi the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and vii general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
acquired intangible assets we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations sfas and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while ipr d  if any  is recorded as an expense at the acquisition date 
the majority of entities acquired by us do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets  potential charges related to ipr d  and potential impairment charges related to goodwill or intangibles 
as of december   we had an aggregate of approximately million reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet related to goodwill and intangible assets 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
if different conditions should prevail  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
as required by sfas  we have not amortized goodwill associated with acquisitions completed after june   for any period presented and ceased amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed prior to july   effective january  as described above  in lieu of amortizing goodwill  we test goodwill for impairment periodically and record any necessary impairment in accordance with sfas our acquired technology intangible assets are currently amortized over a period of fourteen months to three years  using the straight line method 
our customer relationship intangible asset is currently amortized over a period of six years based on the customer attrition rates  currently estimated at approximately per year of the remaining acquired customers 
stock based compensation we have elected to continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method  as prescribed by apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and interpretations thereof collectively apb versus the fair value method allowed by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  deferred compensation is only recorded if the current price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant 
we record and measure deferred compensation for stock options granted to non employees at their fair value 
deferred compensation is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock option  which is generally five years 
please refer to the section entitled employee stock options for further discussion of the accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
legal contingencies as discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  certain of our payroll tax returns  both in the united states and internationally  are currently under examination by the applicable taxing authority 
we believe we have made adequate provision in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any adjustments the taxing authorities may propose with respect to our international payroll tax returns 
we have not made any provision for potential assessments by the irs related to our us payroll tax returns in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  primarily as it relates to stock option exercises  as the amount that we may have to pay is not currently estimable 
we will continually review our estimates related to our payroll tax obligations  including potential assessments from the irs of additional payroll taxes  penalties and or interest  and revise our estimates  if deemed necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our payroll tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to operating expenses in the period that the change in estimate occurs 
we will allocate such a revision in estimate to the appropriate expense category ie  product development  sales and marketing  etc 
based upon the individual employee s functional responsibility in which the additional obligation relates 
such a revision could materially impact our future expense levels and net income 
we are also currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings as discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
in determining the probability of an unfavorable outcome of a particular contingent liability and whether such liability is reasonably estimable  we consider the individual facts and circumstances related to the liability  opinions of legal and tax counsel  recent legal and tax rulings by the appropriate regulatory bodies  among other factors 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates accordingly 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
income taxes as of december   our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets pertains to certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of certain employee stock options 
the valuation allowance will be reduced in the period in which we realize the benefit from the utilization of these credits and losses to reduce our income taxes payable on our income tax return 
when realized  the tax benefit of these credits and losses will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of income tax expense 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our current tax liabilities in each jurisdiction  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
tax liabilities can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we have considered future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for an additional valuation allowance on our remaining deferred tax assets and have concluded that no additional allowance is currently required 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  our us federal income tax returns for  and are currently under examination by the irs 
during  we received notices from the irs of proposed adjustments to these tax returns 
while the final resolution of the irs s ongoing examination is uncertain  we believe that we have made adequate provision in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that the irs has or may propose with respect to our us federal income tax returns 
the final determination of our tax obligations may exceed the amounts provided for by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we will continually review our estimates related to our income tax obligations  including potential assessments from the irs of additional taxes  penalties and or interest  and revise our estimates  if deemed necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to our income tax provision at the time of the change in our estimates 
such a revision could materially impact our effective tax rate  income tax provision and net income 
adoption of accounting standards during  we adopted new accounting standards related to the accounting for and disclosure of revenue derived from our hosted software solution  siebel crm ondemand  restructuring obligations ie  costs associated with exit and disposal activities  asset retirement obligations  and guarantees 
the adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the accounting standards adopted during seasonality our first quarter revenues have typically been lower than the revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter because i many of our customers utilize a significant portion of their capital budgets at the end of their fiscal year  ii the majority of our customers begin a new fiscal year on january  and iii capital expenditures tend to be lower in an organization s first quarter than in its fourth quarter 
we anticipate that this seasonality will continue 
the seasonality between the fourth quarter and first quarter may be impacted by a variety of factors  including changes in the global economy  renewed terrorist attacks and other factors 
please refer to risk factors our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
employee stock options section i 
description of plans since inception  we have believed in broad based employee stock ownership 
accordingly  our stock option program has been instrumental in attracting and retaining talented employees and aligning their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
our stock option program consists primarily of two plans the siebel systems  inc equity incentive plan the plan  and the siebel systems  inc equity incentive plan the plan 
stock options granted to executive officers  key employees and non employee directors are made under the plan and stock options granted to employees other than officers and directors are made under the plan 
our board of directors and stockholders have approved the plan  and our board of directors has approved the plan 
all stock option grants are made after a review by  and with the approval of  the compensation committee of the board of directors 
all members of our compensation committee are independent directors  as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market 
substantially all of our employees participate in one of the above plans  thereby providing us the ability to meet our goal of long term retention of our employees 
stock options granted under these plans expire no later than ten years from the grant date grants expire six years from grant date and generally vest over five years 
please refer to the report of the compensation committee of the board of directors on executive compensation appearing in item of this annual report for further information concerning our policies and the compensation committee s policies regarding the use of stock options 
section ii 
significant actions taken during and related to stock options historically  stock options have been an important component of total compensation for our employees 
accordingly  substantially all employees are granted stock options upon commencement of employment 
we have on occasion assumed stock options of acquired businesses and rewarded existing employees for high levels of performance with additional grants of stock options consideration of additional grants is typically scheduled to occur by the end of the second quarter of each year 
these factors  coupled with significant growth in our employee base  resulted in a significant number of outstanding stock options relative to shares outstanding as of december  we had million stock options outstanding as compared to common shares outstanding 
during and  we took several steps to reduce the number of stock options outstanding from the levels outstanding as of december  these actions  each of which is described further below included i the repurchase of million employee stock options in september in connection with the option repurchase  ii the cancellation of million stock options in january  and iii significantly reduced levels of stock option grants during and  coupled with forfeitures of stock options by terminated employees 
we believe that our actions will continue to align the interests of our employees and management with the interests of our stockholders 
as a result of these actions  stock options outstanding decreased by million during and million during an aggregate of million  or since december  
further  these actions resulted in a decrease in stock options outstanding relative to shares outstanding stock option overhang as follows in thousands  except percentages shares of common stock stock stock options optio n outstanding outstanding overha ng december    december    december    the following is a discussion of the actions we have taken during and option repurchase as discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we completed a tender offer during to repurchase million stock options for total consideration of million  consisting of million of fully vested  non forfeitable shares of the our common stock million shares and million in cash 
a total of million of these shares were subject to a holding period 
we offered to repurchase these stock options primarily through the issuance of shares of our common stock in order to i improve employee morale by eliminating out of the money stock options  ii reduce the net future dilution to existing stockholders  and iii better align employees interests with those of stockholders 
as a result of the option repurchase  outstanding stock options decreased by from the levels as of december   representing net potential dilution to existing stockholders of 
the potential dilution to stockholders is calculated as the stock options canceled less the million shares of common stock issued in exchange for the stock options  divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of december  ceo option cancellation as described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  at the request of our ceo  we cancelled approximately million of our ceo s stock options in january the stock options cancelled had exercise prices ranging from to per share and a black scholes calculated fair value of million at the time of cancellation stock options that were in the money at the time of cancellation represented million  or  of the total fair value at cancellation 
this cancellation represented all stock options granted to our ceo since october our ceo requested the cancellation of these stock options primarily to reduce the number of outstanding stock options relative to the number of shares outstanding 
as a result of this cancellation  outstanding stock options decreased by from the levels as of december   representing net potential dilution to existing stockholders of 
the potential dilution to stockholders is calculated as the stock options canceled  divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of december  we have provided no compensation in exchange for the cancellation of the ceo s stock options  nor will we provide any compensation in the future in exchange for such cancellation 
grants and forfeitures in order to maintain the proper balance between the need to attract and retain employees and minimize the dilution to existing stockholders  we adjusted our compensation structure in to significantly reduce the number of stock options issued to new and existing employees 
we maintained these new equity based compensation guidelines in in addition  commencing in february  we began granting stock options with a contractual life of six years  as opposed to ten years for stock options granted prior to such time 
in accordance with these revised guidelines  we evaluate whether to grant a merit award of stock options to existing employees and officers by the end of the second quarter of each year 
accordingly  during the second quarter of  we granted an aggregate of million stock options to our employees and officers in recognition of their performance and future potential with us 
during  we limited the stock options granted  such that substantially all stock option grants during related to newly hired employees 
the remaining grants during primarily relate to grants to employees upon commencement of employment 
our chairman and ceo did not receive any stock option grants during or immediately upon voluntary or involuntary termination  an employee forfeits all unvested stock options 
any vested stock options of the terminated employee that are not exercised within days from the termination date are forfeited at the expiration of the days 
employees forfeited a total of million and million stock options during and  respectively  in connection with their termination the majority of which occurred as a result of the and restructurings 
during  stock option grants  net of forfeitures by employees upon termination  resulted in a net decrease in our outstanding stock options of from the levels as of december   representing a decrease in net potential dilution to existing stockholders of 
the potential dilution to stockholders from stock options the dilution percentage is calculated as new stock options granted during the year  net of stock options forfeited by employees terminating employment  divided by the total outstanding shares of common stock at the beginning of the year 
as described above  the dilution percentage for only reflects forfeitures by employees upon termination and  accordingly  does not reflect the voluntary cancellation of stock options of our ceo discussed above 
the decrease in the net dilution percentage in of compares to a decrease of during the year ended december  and an increase of during the year ended december  section iii

section iv 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method  as prescribed by apb accordingly  deferred compensation is only recorded if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option on the date of grant 
we record and measure deferred compensation for stock options granted to non employees at their fair value 
deferred compensation is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock option  which is generally five years 
there were no grants of stock options at exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on the dates of grant during  and an alternative to the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options is the fair value approach under sfas we have continued to follow the intrinsic value method of apb  as we believe the accounting for stock options under sfas is highly subjective and does not necessarily reflect the economic substance of an employee stock option 
specifically  the compensation cost under sfas is recognized ratably over the vesting period  regardless of whether the stock options exercise prices are below the fair value of our common stock 
in fact  the value of a stock option  as measured by the fair value of our common stock less the exercise price  actually has an inverse relationship with the amount of expense recognized under sfas accordingly  the stock options with the largest unrealized appreciation in value at any point in time will generally have the smallest amount of expense under sfas and the stock options that are out of the money or have the smallest unrealized appreciation will have the largest amount of expense associated with them under sfas we believe this paradox could be extremely confusing to investors  and perhaps even misleading 
to better illustrate this disparity between the expense recognized under sfas and the realized value related to a stock option  we have provided the following information related to our stock options granted during specifically  excluding options assumed in acquisitions  during we granted stock options with weighted average exercise prices of per share weighted average fair values on the date of grant of per share  as calculated using the black scholes option valuation model 
as of december   the holders of these stock options have realized  as described below  a total of million on these stock options  versus  million of expense  if we had followed the recognition provisions of sfas versus the footnote disclosure provisions 
in other words  if we followed sfas  we would recognize an expense equal to approximately times the benefit received by our employees 
the amount realized represents the actual realized gains upon exercise of the stock options  plus the unrealized gains on stock options that remain outstanding as of december  ie  closing price as of december  of less the applicable exercise price 
as this illustration indicates  the expensing of the fair value of a stock option can be a very unreliable indicator of the benefit that will ultimately be realized by an employee 
accordingly  we believe that expensing stock options  especially in light of the disparity between the amounts expensed and the benefits realized by our employees  may not be meaningful and may actually obscure our current disclosures of the amounts realized by our executive officers on stock options disclosed in section v below of this annual report 
in addition  compensation expense related to vested stock options that are subsequently forfeited or canceled is reflected as an expense  despite the fact that the stock options did not provide an equivalent monetary value in compensation to the employee or dilute existing stockholders 
subsequent to cancellation of a stock option  no additional compensation expense for that cancelled stock option is reported in the pro forma disclosure of stock based compensation 
further  under the fair value approach  employee stock options are required to be valued at grant date using an option valuation model  such as the black scholes or binomial models 
we believe there are limitations to the appropriateness of these option valuation models  including the fact that these option valuation models were developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions  are fully transferable  and typically have shorter terms 
in addition  in accordance with sfas  we must use subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and the expected remaining life as inputs to the black scholes option valuation model 
the number of subjective assumptions required is increased exponentially under the binomial model 
because our stock based awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in our opinion  the existing models that are available to value stock options do not provide an appropriate measure of the fair value of stock based awards to our employees 
as required by sfas  we have prepared a reconciliation of our earnings as reported on the statement of operations to the earnings that we would have reported if we had followed sfas in accounting for our stock based compensation arrangements 
for purposes of this reconciliation  we added back all stock based employee compensation expense recorded in accordance with apb in the statement of operations  then deducted the pro forma stock based employee compensation expense determined under sfas this pro forma effect on earnings represents the amortization of the deferred compensation that is computed using the black scholes option valuation model at the date of the stock option grant 
summarized below are the pro forma effects on our net income loss  as if we had elected to use the fair value approach prescribed by sfas to account for our employee stock based compensation plans in thousands year ended december  net income loss as reported compensation expense related to stock options accounted for in accordance with apb in the money stock options stock purchase rights under the purchase plan pro forma expense related to in the money stock options and purchase pl an    out of the money stock options stock options cancelled for no consideration stock options forfeited cancelled in connection with terminations stock options repurchased on september  total pro forma expense giving effect to sfas pro forma giving effect to sfas in the money stock options in the above table have exercise prices below the closing price of our common stock as of the end of each of the respective periods  and out of the money stock options have exercise prices equal to or greater than the closing price of our common stock as of the end of each of the respective periods

as the table above illustrates  total pro forma expense for stock options includes million   million and million of expense during  and related to i our ceo s stock options that were cancelled for no consideration  ii stock options forfeited by employees upon termination for no consideration  iii stock options that are significantly out of the money eg  the weighted average exercise price of the out of the money stock options was per share compared to a closing price of per share as of december   and iv stock options repurchased for consideration substantially less than is reflected in the table above as a pro forma expense ie  we repurchased the stock options in for million versus the million reflected in the above table for as required by sfas 
these items represented  and of the pro forma expense in the above table for  and  respectively 
please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the fair value approach prescribed by sfas  including the assumptions used to determine the fair value of and resulting sfas expense related to stock options granted  and the procedures followed by us in determining those assumptions

director stock based compensation our directors do not currently receive any cash compensation for service on the board of directors or any committee thereof  but are eligible for reimbursement for certain expenses incurred in attending board of directors and committee meetings 
historically  our non employee directors have received discretionary periodic stock option grants under the plan for service on our board of directors 
in may  after considering the criteria relating to awarding stock options and general market conditions  our board of directors approved the following formal guidelines relating to the grant of stock options to our non employee directors initial grants each new non employee director will be granted an option to purchase  shares of our common stock as soon as practicable following such director s appointment to the board of directors 
annual grants each non employee director who has served on the board of directors for more than six months will be granted an option to purchase  shares of our common stock in january of each year 
we do not intend for stock options granted to non employee directors to qualify as incentive stock options under the internal revenue code 
we believe that these option grant guidelines will motivate and reward our non employee directors for their service in a manner that is consistent with good corporate practice and the independence requirements of the nasdaq national market applicable to members of boards of directors and compensation committees 
notwithstanding the foregoing guidelines  from time to time  including prior to any option grant made to any non employee director  the compensation committee of the board of directors will review the appropriateness and adequacy of these compensation guidelines  taking into consideration actual performance by us and the non employee director and such other factors and circumstances as deemed necessary and appropriate  and exercising such other power and authority as may be permitted or required under the plan

if the surviving corporation and its affiliates refuse to assume  substitute or continue the stock awards  then  with respect to stock awards held by recipients whose continuous service with us has not terminated  the time during which such stock awards may be exercised shall be accelerated and the stock awards shall terminate if not exercised prior to such event 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report and in the other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
prospective and existing investors are strongly urged to carefully consider the various cautionary statements and risks set forth in this annual report and our other public filings 
our total revenue and operating results may fluctuate 
we have experienced and in the future may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
our total revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors include corporate and consumer confidence in the economy  evidenced  in part  by stock market levels  changes in the domestic and international economic  business and political conditions  economic conditions within the information technology industry  level of product and price competition  length of our sales cycle and customer licensing patterns  size and timing of individual license transactions  delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products  success in expanding our global services organization  direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  appropriate mix of products licensed and services sold  levels of international transactions  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  timing of new hires and the allocation of our resources  increases in the cost of software and professional services  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  success of integrating and achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquired companies  and our ability to develop and market new products and control costs 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based upon the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our total revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the main factors that may affect these fluctuations are domestic and international economic  business and political conditions  economic conditions within the information technology industry  the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  the size and complexity of our license transactions  the potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  the timing of new product releases  hiring additional personnel  including sales staff  programmers and other staff  seasonal variations in operating results  and variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers 
each customer s decision to implement our products and services is discretionary  involves a significant commitment of resources and is subject to its budget cycles 
in addition  the timing of license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
if these expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
our future quarterly operating results from time to time may not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  which would likely have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
economic conditions could adversely affect our revenue growth and ability to forecast revenue 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for business applications software and services  particularly within the industries in which we offer specific versions of our products 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers in the high technology  telecommunications  financial services including insurance  pharmaceutical  utilities and consumer packaged goods industries  our business depends on the overall economic conditions and the economic and business conditions within these industries 
the progressive weakening of the global economy  the weakening of the information technology industry  and the weakening of the business conditions within the industries listed above has caused a decrease in our software license revenues in  and a decrease in demand for computer software caused  in part  by a continued weakening of the economy  domestically or internationally  may result in a continued decrease in revenues and growth rates 
hostilities involving the united states and or terrorist attacks could harm our business 
the financial  political  economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states resulted in many of our customers and potential customers becoming much more cautious in setting their capital expenditure budgets  thereby restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs 
subsequent terrorist acts and or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our software license revenue and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers  distributors and suppliers  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a variation in the conversion of our revenue pipeline to contracts could adversely affect our revenues and ability to forecast operations 
our revenue pipeline estimates may not consistently correlate to actual revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
a slowdown in the economy  domestically and internationally  has caused and may continue to cause customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or canceled  all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  primarily due to a substantial portion of our license revenue contracts closing in the latter part of a quarter  management may not be able to adjust our cost structure in response to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner  thereby adversely affecting our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the length of time required to engage a client and to implement our products may be lengthy and unpredictable 
the timing of the sales and implementation of our products and services is lengthy and not predictable with any degree of accuracy 
prior sales and implementation cycles should not be relied upon as any indication of future cycles 
the license of our software products is often an enterprise wide decision by prospective customers and generally requires us to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
in addition  the implementation of our products involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers and is commonly associated with reengineering efforts that may be performed by the customer or third party systems integrators 
the cost to the customer of our product is typically only a portion of the related hardware  software  development  training and integration costs of implementing a large scale ebusiness software system 
for these and other reasons  the period between initial contact and the implementation of our products is often lengthy and is subject to a number of factors that may cause significant delays  over many of which we have little or no control 
these factors include the size and complexity of the overall project and delays in our customers implementation of web based computing environments 
a delay in the sale or implementation of even a limited number of license transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result of current economic conditions  our sales cycle has recently become longer than historical sales cycles 
an unfavorable government review of our income and payroll tax returns or changes in our effective tax rates could adversely affect our operating results 
our operations are subject to income  payroll and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes  and in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
further  the rules related to the remittance of certain payroll taxes are onerous and the compliance with these filing requirements is often difficult to determine 
our us federal income tax returns for  and are currently under examination by the internal revenue service irs 
during  we received notices from the irs of proposed adjustments to these tax returns 
in addition  certain of our payroll tax returns  both in the us and internationally  are currently under examination by the applicable taxing authority 
while we believe that we have made adequate provision related to the audits of our us income tax returns and certain international payroll tax returns  the final determination of our income and payroll tax obligations may exceed the amounts provided for by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
further  we have not made any provision in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for potential assessments by the irs related to our us payroll tax returns  primarily as it relates to stock option exercises  as the amount that we may have to pay is not currently estimable 
we may receive an assessment related to the audit of our us income and payroll tax returns international payroll tax returns that exceeds amounts provided for by us 
in the event we are unsuccessful in reducing the amount of such assessment  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
specifically  if additional taxes and or penalties are assessed as a result of these audits  there could be a material effect on our income tax provision  operating expenses and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we do not have an adequate history with our siebel crm ondemand subscription model to predict the rate of the conversion of our sales pipeline  customer subscription renewals and the impact these renewals will have on our revenue or operating results 
we began offering siebel crm ondemand  a hosted software application delivered as an online service  in the fourth quarter of siebel crm ondemand is offered on a subscription basis  rather than as a perpetual license 
siebel crm ondemand customers have no obligation to renew their service subscriptions after the expiration of the initial subscription period and in fact  some former upshot customers have elected not to renew their subscriptions 
in addition  our customers may renew their service for fewer users 
because the fee structure for siebel crm ondemand is based on the number of users  this could reduce our revenue generated from this service 
we have limited historical data with respect to rates of customer subscription renewals  so we cannot accurately predict customer renewal rates 
our customers renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including their inability to continue their operations and or spending levels 
if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our service  our expectations regarding future revenues from this new product offering may be incorrect  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
further  we do not have an adequate operating history related to this subscription model to effectively estimate expense assumptions and thus we may not be able to adequately predict profitability of this business 
further  we currently expect to invest significantly more in our siebel crm ondemand business model than we expect to realize in revenues from this hosted service in the market for siebel crm ondemand and on demand application services is immature and volatile  and if it does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect  our business will be harmed 
the market for on demand or hosted application services is new and unproven  and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success will depend in part on the willingness of enterprises to increase their use of on demand application services in general and for crm  in particular 
if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of on demand application services  then the market for these services may not develop at all  or it may develop more slowly than we expect  either of which could significantly adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if the demand for our siebel crm ondemand service does not materialize as expected  our ability to recover our investment in upshot corporation  referred to herein as upshot  may be impaired 
as of december   we have approximately million of goodwill and million of amortizable intangibles related to upshot 
interruptions or delays in our siebel crm ondemand service from our third party hosting partners could impair the delivery of our service and harm our business 
we have entered into strategic relationships with hosting partners  including ibm and british telecom  to provide our crm ondemand service through computer hardware located at the facilities of these third parties 
we do not control the operation of these facilities  which could be subject to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including earthquakes  fires  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
the occurrence of one of these events or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service 
in addition  the failure by one of our hosting partners to provide the required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service 
interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue  cause us to issue credits or pay penalties  cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our renewal rates 
if our security measures are breached and an unauthorized party obtains access to a customer s data  our siebel crm ondemand service may be perceived as being insecure and customers may curtail or stop using our service 
our siebel crm ondemand service involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and potential liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose existing customers and our ability to obtain new customers 
we may not successfully complete the integration of our recent acquisition of upshot corporation into our siebel crm ondemand business model 
in order to expedite our entrance into the hosted crm market  we acquired upshot in november the integration of upshot into a fully integrated siebel ondemand business model will take time and the remaining integration work may be difficult  time consuming  particularly in light of this being a new business model 
the combined company must successfully complete its integration of  among other things  certain product and service offerings  product development  sales and marketing  administrative and customer service functions  and management information systems 
in addition  we must retain the key management  key employees  customers  distributors  vendors and other business partners of both companies in order to achieve certain desired synergies 
it is possible that these integration efforts will not be completed as efficiently as planned or will distract management from the operations of the combined company s business 
if we do not successfully complete the integration of the operations of upshot in a timely manner  or at all  the combined company may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we need to successfully integrate our other acquisitions 
our business strategy includes pursuing opportunities to grow our business  internally and through selective acquisitions  investments  joint ventures and strategic alliances 
our ability to implement this strategy depends  in part  on our success in making such acquisitions  investments  joint ventures and strategic alliances on satisfactory terms and successfully integrating them into our operations 
implementation of this strategy may impose significant strains on our management  operating systems and financial resources 
failure to manage this growth  or unexpected difficulties encountered during expansion  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
integration of personnel and operations relating to our previous or future acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire additional companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment 
we may not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel  operations  acquired technology and products acquired from these companies into our business 
in particular  we will need to assimilate and retain key professional services  sales  engineering and marketing personnel 
key personnel from the acquired companies have in certain instances decided  and they may in the future decide  to pursue other opportunities 
in addition  it may be necessary to integrate products of these companies with our technology  and it is uncertain whether we may accomplish this easily or at all 
these integration difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees or increase expenses 
acquisitions are inherently risky  and we may also face unexpected costs  which may adversely affect operating results in any quarter 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets 
we may not be able to successfully implement our and restructurings  and such efforts may adversely impact our ability to retain and attract future employees 
during and  we completed a restructuring of our operations involving  among other things  the reduction of our workforce and the consolidation of excess facilities collectively the and restructurings 
as part of the and restructurings  we ceased to use certain of our leased facilities 
the removal of these facilities from our operations will require us to negotiate certain lease terminations and or subleases of our facilities 
we cannot predict when or if we will be successful in negotiating lease termination agreements or subleases of our facilities on terms acceptable to us 
should we be unsuccessful in such negotiations or if the negotiated terms are less favorable than currently anticipated  we may be required to materially increase our restructuring and related expenses in future periods 
in addition  the and restructurings may not achieve all of the benefits we currently anticipate or on the timetable contemplated 
workforce reductions  including the ones we completed in and  could result in a lack of focus and reduced productivity by our remaining employees  which in turn may affect our revenues in a future quarter 
in addition  prospects and current customers may decide to delay or not purchase our products due to the perceived uncertainty caused by the and restructurings 
we cannot assure you that we will not reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce again in the future or that the related transition issues associated with such a reduction will not occur again 
in addition  employees  whether or not directly affected by the reduction  may seek future employment with our business partners  customers or competitors 
although our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time of hire  we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of certain proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
further  we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
we may have difficulty attracting such personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce reductions 
if we do not successfully manage the size of our operations  our business may be negatively impacted 
if we fail to manage the size of our operations effectively  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
since we began operations in and continuing throughout early  our business grew rapidly 
beginning in early and continuing through  our revenues have declined as a result of deterioration in the overall economy and information technology industry 
these rapid changes in our business have placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
in response to the continued deterioration in the information technology industry  management completed the and restructurings 
the and restructurings have particular risks  many of which are discussed above under we may not be able to successfully implement our and restructurings  and such efforts may adversely impact our ability to retain and attract future employees 
in addition  if we return to growth in the future  that growth may require us to implement new systems or upgrade current systems  and the failure to successfully implement such new or improved systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
rapid change will require us to manage the size of our employee base  particularly our direct sales force and global support staff 
the majority of our expenses are personnel related costs such as employee compensation and benefits  along with the cost of the infrastructure occupancy and equipment to support our employee base 
the failure to adjust our employee base  particularly our direct sales force and technical and global services staff  to the appropriate level to support our revenues could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  expanding the distribution of our products may place new and increased demands on our direct sales force and technical and sales support staff 
although we currently invest sufficient resources in our direct sales force and our technical and global services staff  there are only a limited number of qualified personnel in these areas 
our ability to achieve expanded distribution and revenue growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success in recruiting and training sufficient direct sales  technical and global services personnel 
we may not be able to expand our direct sales force and technical support staff as necessary to support our operations 
if requirements relating to accounting treatment for employee stock options are changed  we may be forced to change our business practices or our earnings may be affected 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the american institute of certified public accountants  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results  and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change 
for example  we currently account for the issuance of stock options under apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
however  several companies have recently elected to change their accounting policies and begun to record the fair value of stock options as an expense 
although the standards have not been finalized and the timing of a final statement has not been established  fasb has announced its support for recording expense for the fair value of stock options granted 
if we were required to change our accounting policy in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and retroactively restate prior periods as if we had adopted these standards for all periods presented  then our cost of revenues and operating expenses would have increased by approximately million for fiscal as a result  we may decide to reduce the number of stock options granted to employees or to grant options to fewer employees 
this could affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates  and increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them 
we rely on strategic relationships with systems integrators  distributors  resellers and technology vendors 
failure to maintain existing strategic relationships with systems integrators  distributors  resellers and technology vendors  or to establish new relationships in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have established strategic relationships with a number of organizations that we believe are important to our sales  marketing and support activities and the implementation of our products 
we believe that our relationships with these organizations provide marketing and sales opportunities for our direct sales force and expand the distribution of our products 
these relationships allow us to keep pace with the technological and marketing developments of major software vendors and provide us with technical assistance for our product development efforts 
in particular  we have established non exclusive strategic relationships with accenture  cap gemini ernst young  deloitte consulting  ibm corporation and bearingpoint  among others 
a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from customers that have engaged systems integrators with which we have a relationship 
any deterioration of our relationship with these significant third party systems integrators could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we also have relationships with technology vendors such as hewlett packard  microsoft and sun microsystems  among others 
failure to maintain existing relationships on terms equally favorable to us  or to establish new relationships in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our current and potential customers may also rely on third party systems integrators to develop  deploy or manage siebel ebusiness applications 
if we do not adequately train a sufficient number of systems integrators  or if these integrators do not have  or do not devote  the resources necessary to implement our products  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our customers may not successfully implement our products 
if existing customers have difficulty deploying siebel ebusiness applications or for any other reason are not satisfied with siebel ebusiness applications  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
many of our customers purchase and implement our products in phases 
our customers frequently deploy our products to large numbers of sales  marketing and customer service personnel 
these end users may not accept our products 
our products are also being deployed on a variety of computer hardware platforms and used with a number of third party software applications and programming tools 
this use may present significant technical challenges  particularly as large numbers of personnel attempt to use our products concurrently 
a limited number of products provide a substantial part of our license revenues 
a majority of our software license revenues in are attributable to sales of our crm applications  particularly siebel sales  siebel service  siebel call center  siebel interactive selling and related products 
we have also expanded our product offerings to include siebel analytics  siebel employee relationship management  universal application network and siebel crm ondemand 
we expect that our crm applications and our recent product offerings  along with the related consulting  maintenance and training services  will continue to account for a majority of our future revenues 
factors adversely affecting the cost and pricing of  or demand for  these products  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our software license revenue is dependent on our ability to enter into significant software license transactions with new and existing customers 
our success depends on gaining new customers and maintaining relationships with our existing customers 
in particular  if the number of software license transactions and the average size of these transactions decrease  our software license revenue may be negatively impacted 
both the number of transactions generating software license revenues and the average size of these transactions have declined over the past two years 
specifically  the number of transactions generating software license revenues greater than million has decreased from transactions in and transactions in  to transactions in in addition  the average size of these transactions has decreased in each of the last two years from  in and  in  to  in consequently  our software license revenue also decreased in both and the failure to enter into significant software license transactions with new and existing customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
no single customer has accounted for or more of our software license revenues in  or our distribution channels may create additional risks 
failure to minimize channel conflicts could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a number of relationships with resellers  which assist us in obtaining broad market coverage 
we have generally avoided exclusive relationships with resellers of our products 
discount policies and reseller licensing programs are intended to support each distribution channel with a minimum level of channel conflicts 
our continued success will require us to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by i rapid technological change  ii frequent introductions of new products  iii changing customer needs  and iv evolving industry standards 
to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs  we must support existing products and develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products or new versions of siebel ebusiness applications that respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these enhancements 
in addition  these enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements to siebel ebusiness applications are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forego purchases of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the internet related products and services market 
siebel ebusiness applications communicate through public and private networks over the internet 
the success of our products may depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing products that are compatible with the internet 
additionally  expansion in the sales of our service depends on the continued acceptance of the internet as a communications and commerce platform for enterprises 
the internet could lose its viability as a business tool due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of internet activity  security  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  and quality of service 
the performance of the internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been harmed by viruses  worms  and similar malicious programs and the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure 
if for any reason the internet does not remain a widespread communications medium and commercial platform  the demand for our service would be significantly reduced  which would harm our business 
we cannot predict with any assurance whether the demand for internet related products and services will increase or decrease in the future 
the increased commercial use of the internet could require substantial modification and customization of our products and the introduction of new products 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  privacy  demand  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service and potential tax or other government regulation remain unresolved and may affect the use of the internet as a medium to support the functionality of our products and distribution of our software 
if these critical issues are not favorably resolved  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing market 
if the web based applications market fails to grow  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the market for web based applications software is relatively new  highly competitive and rapidly changing 
we market our products primarily to customers who have migrated or are in the process of migrating their enterprise computing systems to web based computing environments 
our future financial performance will partly depend on the continued growth of organizations successfully adopting web based computing environments 
to be successful  we must effectively compete in the business applications market 
our products target the market for business applications software 
this market is highly competitive  rapidly changing  and significantly affected by new product introductions and the market activities of other industry participants 
our products are specifically targeted at the market for customer  partner and employee relationship information systems  as well as the markets for analytics and application integration 
we face competition primarily from our customers internal information technology departments and systems integrators  as well as other application software providers that offer a variety of products and services designed to address these markets 
we believe that most customer deployments have been the result of large internal development projects  custom solutions from systems integrators  or the application of personal and departmental productivity tools to the global enterprise 
we may not be able to compete successfully against such internal development efforts 
beginning in and continuing throughout the first half of  the global economy impacted the competitive dynamics of the business applications market in which we compete in a variety of ways 
specifically  our customers and prospective customers are increasingly evaluating their software procurement needs with a focus on the long term total cost of ownership  which includes the cost of the license and the related professional services  such as implementation  training  and technical support 
with significantly lower license costs from competitive solutions  and no license cost for internal projects  our success depends on our ability to adequately communicate the relative capabilities of our products  the total cost of ownership of the various alternative solutions ie  versus the cost of only the license  and the total return on investment of each of the various alternatives 
the following is discussion of each of the individual competitive environments in which we operate internal development many of our customers and potential customers have in the past attempted to develop sales  marketing  customer service and employee relationship information systems in house  either alone or with the help of systems integrators 
internal information technology departments have staffed projects to build their own systems utilizing a variety of tools 
in some cases  such internal development projects have been successful in satisfying the needs of an organization 
to compete successfully  our products must conform to the customer s information technology standards  scale to meet the needs of large enterprises  operate globally and cost less than the result of an internal development effort 
we may not be able to compete effectively against these internal development efforts 
custom system integration projects we also face competition from systems integrators engaged by companies to build a custom development application 
the introduction of a systems integrator typically increases the likelihood of success for the customer 
to successfully compete in this area  we must demonstrate and provide to the customer the cost savings and advantages of a configurable  upgradable and commercially supported product developed by a dedicated professional software organization 
we frequently rely on a number of systems consulting and systems integration firms for a substantial portion of implementation and other global services  as well as recommendations of our products during the evaluation stage of the purchase process 
although we seek to maintain close relationships with these service providers  many of them have similar and often more established relationships with our competitors 
if we are unable to develop and retain effective  long term relationships with these third parties  our competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 
further  some of these third parties have significantly greater resources than we do and may market software products that compete with us and may otherwise reduce or discontinue their relationships with or support of us and our products 
other competitors a large number of personal  departmental  and other products exist in the business applications market 
our competitors include a number of companies that compete with us primarily within a particular product line eg  analytics  interactive selling  etc 
and or the prospective customer s industry eg  life sciences  financial services  eg these companies include amdocs limited  cas gmbh  chordiant software  inc  dendrite international  inc  e 
piphany  inc  frontrange solutions  inc  interact commerce corporation  kana software  inc  onyx software corporation  pivotal corporation  salesforce 
com  inc  and stayinfront  inc  among many others 
in addition  our competitors include several companies  such as oracle corporation  peoplesoft  inc and sap ag  which compete in a majority of our product lines 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition  a broader product offering  and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
in addition  many competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
there are many factors that may increase competition in the business systems market  including i entry of new competitors  ii alliances among existing competitors  iii alliances between our competitors and systems integrators  iv consolidation in the software industry or among systems integrators  and v technological changes or changes in the use of the internet 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or competitive pressures faced by us may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we do not maintain our relationships with third party vendors  interruptions in the supply of our products may result 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
portions of our products incorporate software that was developed and is maintained by third party software developers 
although we believe there are other sources for these products  any significant interruption in the supply of these products could adversely impact our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
we depend in part on these third parties abilities to enhance their current products  to develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of functionality provided by third party software in our products could materially and adversely affect our sales 
software errors or defects in our products could reduce revenues 
software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released  and could be affected by viruses 
we have  in the past  been forced to delay the commercial release of products until the software problems have been corrected 
we could lose revenues as a result of software viruses  errors or defects  including defects in third party products with which our products work 
our products are intended for use in applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
as a result  we expect that our customers and potential customers will have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for software products generally 
testing errors may also be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we cannot hire enough qualified employees or if we lose key employees  it will adversely affect our ability to manage our business  develop our products and increase our revenues 
our performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  particularly thomas m 
siebel  our chairman and ceo 
our key employees have not entered into employment agreements with us 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in recent years  we have had members of our senior management announce their retirement or departure from our company 
we replace these individuals with internal candidates and  if deemed appropriate  individuals from outside our organization 
while our internal candidates understand our business model  they must learn a new position and take on additional or new responsibilities  which could take time and result in the disruption to our ongoing operations 
to integrate into our company  new senior personnel must spend a significant amount of time learning our business model and management systems  in addition to performing their regular duties 
accordingly  until new senior personnel become familiar with our business model and systems  their integration may result in some disruption to our ongoing operations 
additionally  we may need to hire additional personnel in general or to replace internal candidates who have been promoted and as a result  we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices 
we periodically have restructured our sales force  which can be disruptive 
we continue to rely heavily on our direct sales force 
in recent years  we have restructured or made other adjustments to our sales force in response to factors such as management changes  product changes and other internal considerations 
changes in the structure of the sales force and sales force management have generally resulted in a temporary lack of focus and reduced productivity that may have affected revenues in one or more quarters 
we cannot assure you that we will not continue to restructure our sales force or that the transition issues associated with restructuring the sales force will not recur 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary information 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we also believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under patent  trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
any patents issued to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around our patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate 
we have entered into agreements with substantially all of our customers that require us to place siebel ebusiness applications source code into escrow 
such agreements generally provide that such parties will have a limited  non exclusive right to use such code if i there is a bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  ii we cease to do business  or iii we fail to meet our support obligations 
although we do not believe that we are infringing any proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
furthermore  former employers of our former  current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of such former employers 
any such claims  with or without merit  could i be time consuming to defend  ii result in costly litigation  iii divert management s attention and resources  iv cause product shipment delays  and v require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license or create a workaround for such infringed or similar technology may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations involve unique risks 
our revenues are primarily derived from large multinational companies 
to service the needs of these companies  we must provide worldwide product support services 
we have expanded and in the future may expand our international operations and enter additional international markets 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect our operating margins and earnings 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for siebel ebusiness applications 
if we do not  our international sales will be limited and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including i foreign currency fluctuations  ii economic or political instability  iii shipping delays  and iv various trade restrictions 
any of these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
significant increases in the level of customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in situations where direct sales or purchases are denominated in foreign currency  any fluctuation in the exchange rate may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
generally  we manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into contracts to sell or purchase foreign currency at the time a foreign currency receivable or payable is generated 
when the foreign currency asset or liability is extinguished  the contract is liquidated  and the resulting gain or loss on the contract mitigates the exchange rate risk of the associated asset or liability 
in certain instances  we have not hedged foreign currency receivables and payables when the forward contracts in the relevant currency were not readily available or were not cost effective 
our current officers  directors and entities affiliated with us may be able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval 
our current officers  directors and entities affiliated with us together beneficially owned a significant portion of the outstanding shares of common stock as of december  while these stockholders do not hold a majority of our outstanding common stock  they will be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations and sales of our assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the tables below provide information about our derivative financial instruments and financial instruments that are subject to market risk 
the first table includes our foreign currency contracts used to minimize the impact of changes in currency rates on existing foreign currency receivables  payables and intercompany balances  which are subject to exchange rate risk 
the second table includes our available for sale short term investments  which are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into contracts to sell or buy foreign currency at the time a foreign currency receivable or payable is generated 
when the foreign currency asset or liability is extinguished  the contract is liquidated  and the resulting gain or loss on the contract mitigates the exchange rate risk of the associated asset or liability 
the following table summarizes as of december   our foreign currency forward contracts  by currency 
all of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within a year 
contract amounts are representative of the expected payments to be made under these instruments in thousands contract amount contract fair local currency amount valu e us australian dollars aud contracts to pay aud receive us aud  us  brazilian real brl contracts to pay brl receive us brl  us  british pounds gbp contracts to pay gbp receive eur gbp  eur  canadian dollar cad contracts to pay cad receive us cad  us  japanese yen yen contracts to pay yen receive us yen  us  korea won krw contracts to pay krw receive us krw  us mexican peso mxn contracts to pay mxn receive us mxn  us  singapore dollars sgd contracts to pay sgd receive us sgd  us  czech republic koruna czk contracts to receive czk pay eur czk  eur  euro eur contracts to receive eur pay us eur  us  swedish krona sek contracts to receive sek pay eur sek  eur  swiss franc chf contracts to receive chf pay eur chf  eur  the following table summarizes our short term investments and the weighted average yields  as of december  in thousands  except percentages expected maturity d ate thereafter total us treasury and agency securities 
    weighted average yield corporate bonds     weighted average yield asset backed securities     weighted average yield total short term investments     as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of  million 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and  accordingly  if market interest rates increase  these investments will decline in value 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio with debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
we also manage interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity
