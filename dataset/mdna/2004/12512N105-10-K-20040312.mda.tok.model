item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview we are a leading direct marketer of multi brand computers and related technology products and services in the united states 
our primary business is conducted from a combined corporate office and distribution center located in vernon hills  illinois  and sales offices in illinois  virginia  connecticut  new jersey  and toronto  canada 
additionally  we market and sell products through cdw 
com  cdwg 
com and macwarehouse 
com  our web sites 
for financial reporting purposes  we have two operating segments corporate  which is primarily comprised of business customers  but also includes consumers which generated approximately of net sales in  and public sector  which is comprised of federal  state and local government entities and educational institutions who are served by cdw government  inc cdw g  a wholly owned subsidiary 
cdw management monitors a number of financial and non financial measures and ratios on a daily  weekly  and monthly basis in order to track the progress of the business and make adjustments as necessary 
we believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include daily sales  by business segment and total company  gross margin  number of orders shipped per day  number of orders shipped complete per day  inventory balance and turnover  cash and cash equivalents balance  and accounts receivable balance and aging 
the measures and ratios are compared to standards or targets set by management  so that actions can be taken  as necessary  in order to achieve the standards and targets 
financial reporting release no 
 released by the securities and exchange commission  encourages all registrants to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
we present in the notes to our consolidated financial statements a summary of these accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  distribution and promotion of our products 
therefore  our accounting principles in the areas of revenue recognition  trade accounts receivable valuation  inventory valuation  vendor transactions and marketing activities are the most significant 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make use of certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
significant estimates in our financial statements include allowances for doubtful accounts receivable  sales returns and pricing disputes  net realizable value of inventories  vendor transactions  loss contingencies and intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio along with specifically identified customer risks 
if actual customer payment performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents sales returns and pricing disputes 
at the time of sale  we record an estimate for sales returns and pricing disputes based on historical experience 
if actual sales returns and pricing disputes are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
net realizable value of inventories 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we decrease the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
vendor transactions 
we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  rebates  price protection and other programs 
these incentives generally relate to agreements with the vendors and are recorded as adjustments to gross margin or net advertising expense  as appropriate 
if market conditions were to deteriorate  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
loss contingencies 
we accrue for contingent obligations when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
intangible assets 
we purchased intangible assets  such as customer lists  in connection with the micro warehouse transactions described below 
these intangible assets have finite lives  and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives  generally seven years 
during september  we purchased selected us assets and the canadian operations of micro warehouse  a reseller of computers  software and peripheral products 
the us transaction  completed on september   was accounted for as a purchase of assets  with the million purchase price allocated to the assets purchased  including inventory  fixed assets  and customer lists  based upon their fair values at the date of purchase 
subsequent to the completion of the us transaction  sales made by former members of the micro warehouse us sales force who joined cdw in conjunction with this transaction  along with the associated costs  are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the canadian transaction  completed on september   was accounted for as the purchase of a business and  accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired business subsequent to the date of purchase are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and the assumed assets and liabilities were recorded based upon their fair values at the date of purchase 
the canadian operations were purchased for million 
total recorded transaction and integration expenses associated with these transactions were million  with million recorded in the third quarter of and million recorded in the fourth quarter of these expenses are primarily comprised of severance and outplacement costs  payroll expenses for former micro warehouse employees performing transition services  customer satisfaction expenses  customer communications and advertising expenses  legal and accounting advisory fees and a reserve established for the equipment in a wilmington  ohio distribution center leased by micro warehouse 
these expenses are included in cost of sales million  selling and administrative expenses million  net advertising expenses million and other expense million in the consolidated statements of income

table of contents for public sector segment sales increased  from million in to billion in  and comprised of our total sales for in general  the average selling price of most of our product categories decreased from we believe there may be future decreases in pricing for technology products in  resulting in a lower average invoice size 
such decreases require us to generate more orders and sell more units in order to maintain or increase the level of sales 
on a forward looking basis  our core strategies to grow our business include further penetrate existing accounts  expand our customer base  enhance the productivity and increase the number of our account managers  optimize our product mix  strengthen national brand awareness and selectively pursue strategic transactions 
gross profit increased to million in  compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was in  compared to in the increase in the gross profit percentage was primarily due to the adoption in january of a new accounting pronouncement  emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration received from a vendor by a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products eitf 
the income statement classification provisions of eitf cover vendor consideration related to agreements entered into or modified after january  this pronouncement requires that consideration from vendors  such as advertising support funds  be accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales unless certain requirements are met showing that the funds are used for a specific program entirely funded by an individual vendor 
if these specific requirements related to individual vendors are met  the consideration is accounted for as a reduction in the related expense category  such as advertising or selling and administrative expense 
we provide numerous advertising programs to support vendors  including catalogs  television  radio  internet  magazine  and newspaper advertising for which we receive consideration 
some of these programs relate to multiple vendors  while others are performed on behalf of individual vendors for specific projects 
as a consequence of adopting eitf  we recorded million of vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales in  which would have previously been recorded as a reduction of advertising expense million and selling and administrative expense million 
excluding the impact of eitf  and therefore on a non gaap basis  the gross profit margin would have been in compared to in the non gaap gross profit margin is included in this discussion because the company believes it provides a meaningful comparison to reported results of prior periods 
our gross profit objective as a percentage of net sales is between and  excluding the impact of eitf the gross profit margin depends on various factors  including vendor inventory price protection and rebate programs  product mix  including third party services  pricing strategies  market conditions  and other factors  any of which could result in a fluctuation of gross margins below recent experience 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million in  compared to million in included in selling and administrative expenses in were million of transaction and integration expenses related to the micro warehouse transactions 
the primary drivers of the increase in selling and administrative expenses are discussed below 
payroll costs increased million  including million of expenses for former micro warehouse employees performing transition services 
the remainder of the increase in payroll costs was due to an increase in our sales force from  at december  to  at december   including former members of the micro warehouse sales force who joined cdw in september in conjunction with the micro warehouse transactions 
our sales force consists of account managers including field sales representatives as well as product category specialists who provide consultation in areas requiring technical or specialized product expertise such as networking  security  data storage  and volume software licensing

the remaining million relates to a reserve established for the equipment in a wilmington  ohio distribution center leased by micro warehouse 
in september  in conjunction with our purchase of selected us assets of micro warehouse  we agreed to assume the lease for the distribution center and purchase the equipment in the facility for million if requested by micro warehouse 
in february  under the terms of a modified agreement  we purchased the equipment and forfeited leasing the distribution center in exchange for million

selling and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in versus in transaction and integration expenses recorded in connection with the micro warehouse transactions  totaling million  accounted for of the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales

seasonality sales in our corporate segment  which serves primarily business and  to a small extent  consumer markets  have not historically experienced significant seasonality throughout the year 
in contrast  sales in our public sector segment have historically been higher in the third quarter than in other quarters due to the buying patterns of federal government and education customers 
if sales to public sector customers continue to increase as a percentage of overall sales  the company as a whole may experience increased seasonality in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources working capital we have historically financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities of million and working capital of million  representing an increase of million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities and an increase of million in working capital from december  the increase in working capital was a result of increases in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  accounts receivable and merchandise inventory  partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses

we currently have one distribution center  located with our corporate headquarters  in vernon hills  illinois 
the capacity of this distribution center should be sufficient to handle our expected growth in sales and shipments at least through  based on current projections

we anticipate that a second distribution center may be required in order to continue to support the company s growth beyond  unless the capacity of the existing distribution center can be expanded through automation  additional shifts for receiving and shipping  or other actions 
accordingly  we have begun evaluating possible locations for a second distribution center 
we will consider in our evaluation factors such as concentration of customers  shipping patterns for product received from our vendors as well as shipments to our customers and work force availability 
because the evaluation is in process  we do not have an estimate of the cost for a second distribution center  but we believe that our internally generated cash flow will be sufficient to cover the capital expenditures for the distribution center 
our current and anticipated uses of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are to fund growth in working capital and capital expenditures necessary to support future growth in sales  our stock buyback program  potential dividends and possible expansion through acquisitions
