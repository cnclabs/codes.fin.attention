critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to understanding its business and results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item on form k  beginning on page note that the preparation of this form k requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current credit worthiness  as determined by management s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have generally been within the company s historical expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have occurred in the past 
the company s consolidated trade accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
some of the company s laboratory services revenues for certain types of tests are billed to third party payors including insurance companies  state medicaid and medicare agencies 
these payors pay for such services at established amounts  which are typically lower than gross amounts billed by the company 
however  the tests are sometimes billed directly to patients or other parties and paid at the gross amount billed for these tests 
in addition  billings for the tests are occasionally re billed to alternative payors in situations where incorrect billing information was submitted to the company by the customer 
the company estimates a discount on the billings for these tests  and recognizes revenue and related accounts receivable at a net amount  after discount  in order to state revenue and accounts receivable at the amount expected to be paid 
while the company believes that estimated discounts and the related net revenue and net accounts receivable from these testing services are materially correct  there can be differences in amounts ultimately paid compared to estimated amounts 
these differences are recorded upon payment and may affect previously recorded amounts 
the company considers historical discounts when estimating future discounts on a monthly basis 
off site supplies inventory off site supplies represents collection kits and forms located at collections sites throughout the united states used by laboratory services customers to submit specimens for testing services 
at december   off site inventory was million 
the process for valuing off site inventory involves significant assumptions regarding the average time that a collection site uses the inventory  as well as the amount of inventory expected to be scrapped 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january  sfas no 
provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are instead reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances 
the company completed the necessary transition impairment review for goodwill and other intangible assets in  and determined that there was no impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year 
no impairments were indicated as a result of the annual impairment reviews for goodwill and other intangible assets in and in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and tax planning strategies  and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company increases or decreases the valuation allowance in a period  the company must include an expense or benefit within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company s deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating losses nols carried forward 
at december   the company has a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million  which represents the portion of its nol carryforwards that will more likely than not expire unused in and future years 
the valuation allowance is based on management s estimate of taxable income  the period over which nols will be recoverable  and tax planning strategies 
in the future  subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of these deferred tax assets could cause the provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although the company s cash payments would remain unaffected until the benefit of the nol is completely utilized or expires unused 
results of operations revenues declined slightly in and continued to be impacted by the softness in new business employment 
gross margin was also down  reflecting a reduced margin in the product sales segment  despite improvement in the laboratory services segment 
operating expenses were higher due to the continued investment in research and development and severance costs related to staffing reductions 
other expense was also higher than last year due to reduced rental income from the company s building rental activities 
in  the company recorded a million non cash tax benefit as part of net income 
the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations revenues

revenues from the company s specialty laboratory services remain strong  increasing in in the product sales segment  sales of substance abuse testing products  which incorporates the profile ii  profile ii er  profile ii a and verdict ii on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  declined to million in the decline is primarily attributable to lower sales within the verdict ii product line to government clients for probation  parole and rehabilitation 
the economic uncertainty and budget constraints that the company s government clients are experiencing resulted in lower purchasing levels among these clients 
the company anticipates that the government sector will continue to be a challenging environment  and will continue to pursue new sales efforts that the company believes will improve this portion of its business going forward 
principally  during the second quarter of  the company introduced a proprietary value added service called dars drug abuse recognition system that it believes will increase sales in the government marketplace 
sales of profile ii devices to existing workplace and occupational clients were also down from last year and continue to be impacted by the reduction in nationwide hiring

sales of the profile ii a increased in the profile ii er product  targeted at hospital laboratories for emergency response screening in drugs of abuse overdose situations  continues to grow  increasing in product sales from agricultural diagnostic products increased to million in primarily as a result of increased purchases from the us department of agriculture usda for the company s products 
sales of contract manufacturing services  microbiological and associated products of million in were flat compared to gross profit consolidated gross margin declined to in compared to in gross margin from product sales declined to in  compared to in this decline was largely due to the costs associated with the expansion and improvement of the production facility on lower than projected sales volume  as well as increased spending in quality control

income taxes the company did not record a tax provision or benefit for at december   the company has a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million  which represents the portion of its net operating loss nol carryforwards that will more likely than not expire unused in and future years

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million in  driven by a million  or increase in product sales revenues and a million  or increase in laboratory services revenues 
the growth in laboratory services was primarily due to a increase in the company s specialty laboratory services revenues 
this increase is due to the expansion of clinical testing for the pharmaceutical industry and the october acquisition of leadtech corporation leadtech  a pediatric lead testing laboratory 
specimen volume from occupational health and corporate clients increased in the slow economy and poor labor market caused volume from existing occupational health and corporate clients to be below expectations 
however  this impact was largely mitigated by the company s continued success in acquiring new client relationships and gaining market share 
in the product sales segment  sales of substance abuse testing products  which incorporates the profile ii  profile ii er  profile ii a and verdict ii on site test kits and other ancillary products for the detection of abused substances  increased during sales of profile ii devices to existing workplace clients were down from last year and continued to be impacted by the reduction in nationwide hiring

cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower income before income taxes as well as a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable and inventories 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased million in compared to an increase of million in the significant reduction in the current year was primarily the result of the more timely payment of outstanding invoices 
accounts receivable decreased million in compared to an increase of million in the significant increase in accounts receivable in was primarily the result of an increase in receivables due from third party payors such as insurance companies  state medicaid and medicare agencies 
payment cycles from such payors can be lengthy  and in certain cases  were adversely affected in by incomplete or incorrect billing information provided to the company by its customers 
in  the company was able to shorten the payment cycle for such payors through a better understanding of the insurance claim filing requirements and by converting manual billings to an electronic format for certain medicaid state agencies
