index overview critical accounting estimates consolidated results of operations operating summary life investment products individual life group benefits corporate owned life insurance coli property casualty business insurance personal lines specialty commercial reinsurance other operations including asbestos and environmental claims investments investment credit risk capital markets risk management capital resources and liquidity effect of inflation impact of new accounting standards overview the hartford provides investment products and life and property and casualty insurance to both individual and business customers in the united states and internationally 
the company is organized into two major operations life and property casualty 
an overview of these operations and the principal factors that drive the profitability of these operations follows 
life life provides investment and retirement products such as variable and fixed annuities  mutual funds and retirement plan services and other institutional products  individual and corporate owned life insurance  and  group benefit products  such as group life and group disability insurance 
life derives its revenues principally from a fee income  including asset management fees  on separate account and mutual fund assets and mortality and expense fees  as well as cost of insurance charges  b fully insured premiums  c certain other fees  and d net investment income on general account assets 
asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are primarily generated from separate account assets  which are deposited with the company through the sale of variable annuity and variable universal life products and from mutual funds 
cost of insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk for investment oriented life insurance products 
premium revenues are derived primarily from the sale of group life and group disability insurance products 
life s expenses essentially consist of interest credited to policyholders on general account liabilities  insurance benefits provided  dividends to policyholders  costs of selling and servicing the various products offered by the company  and other general business expenses 
life s profitability in its variable annuity  mutual fund and  to a lesser extent  variable universal life businesses depends largely on the amount of its assets under management on which it earns fees and the level of fees charged 
changes in assets under management are comprised of two main factors net flows  which measure the success of life s asset gathering and retention efforts sales and other deposits less surrenders and the market return of the funds  which is heavily influenced by the return on the equity markets 
the profitability of life s fixed annuities depends largely on its ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on its general account assets and interest credited to policyholders 
profitability is also influenced by operating expense management including the benefits of economies of scale in its variable annuity businesses in particular 
in addition  the size and persistency of gross profits from these businesses is an important driver of earnings as it affects the amortization of the deferred policy acquisition costs 
life s profitability in its individual life insurance and group benefits businesses depends largely on the size of its in force block  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline  and the efficiency of its claims and expense management 
property casualty property casualty provides a number of coverages to businesses throughout the united states  including workers compensation  property  automobile  liability  umbrella  specialty casualty  marine  agriculture  bond  professional liability and directors and officer s liability coverage 
property casualty also provides automobile  homeowners and home based business coverage to individuals throughout the united states as well as insurance related services to businesses 
property casualty derives its revenues principally from premium earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds  investment income  net realized capital gains and losses  and  to a lesser extent  from fees earned for services provided to third parties 
premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies in force 
service fees principally include revenues from third party claims administration services provided by specialty risk services and revenues from member contact center services provided through aarp s health care options program 
property casualty underwriting segments are evaluated by the hartford s management primarily based upon underwriting results 
underwriting results represent earned premiums less incurred claims  claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses 
underwriting results are influenced significantly by the adequacy of the company s pricing 
property casualty seeks to price its insurance policies such that insurance premiums and net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin 
for some of its insurance products  property casualty is required to obtain approval for its premium rates from state insurance departments 
underwriting profitability is also greatly influenced by the company s underwriting discipline which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and by its ability to manage its expense ratio which it accomplishes through economies of scale and its management of underwriting expenses 
in setting its pricing  property casualty assumes an expected level of losses from natural or man made catastrophes that will cover the company s exposure to catastrophes over the long term 
in any one year  however  property casualty s actual losses from catastrophes may be significantly more or less than that assumed in its pricing 
a catastrophe loss is an event that causes or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers 
also  given the lag in the period from when claims are incurred to when they are reported and paid  final claim settlements may vary from current estimates of incurred losses and loss expenses  particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future 
adjustments to previously established loss and loss expense reserves  if any  are reflected in underwriting results in the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
through its other operations segment  property casualty is responsible for managing the operations of the hartford that have discontinued writing new business as well as managing the claims related to asbestos and environmental exposures 
as such  the underwriting loss in other operations is principally related to development on claim and claim adjustment expense reserves 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company has identified the following estimates as critical in that they involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability  reserves  investments  deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits  pension and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies 
in developing these estimates management makes subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes the amounts provided are appropriate based upon the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
reserves life the company s life insurance subsidiaries establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves which are calculated to meet the hartford s future obligations 
reserves for life insurance and disability contracts are based on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the united states  which are modified to reflect the company s actual experience when appropriate 
these reserves are computed at amounts that  with additions from estimated premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually at certain assumed rates  are expected to be sufficient to meet the company s policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insured s death 
changes in or deviations from the assumptions used for mortality  morbidity  expected future premiums and interest can significantly affect the company s reserve levels and related future operations 
reserves also include unearned premiums  premium deposits  claims incurred but not reported ibnr and claims reported but not yet paid 
reserves for assumed reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance reserves 
the liability for policy benefits for universal life type contracts and interest sensitive whole life policies is equal to the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders  including credited interest  amounts that have been assessed to compensate the company for services to be performed over future periods  and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract 
for investment contracts  policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account values  which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest  less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the period 
certain investment contracts include provisions whereby a guaranteed minimum death benefit gmdb is provided in the event that the contractholder s account value at death is below the guaranteed value 
although the company reinsures the majority of the death benefit guarantees associated with its in force block of business  declines in the equity market may increase the company s net exposure to death benefits under these contracts 
in addition  these contracts contain various provisions for determining the amount of the death benefit guaranteed following the withdrawal of a portion of the account value by the policyholder 
partial withdrawals under certain of these contracts may not result in a reduction in the guaranteed minimum death benefit in proportion to the account value surrendered 
the company records the death benefit costs  net of reinsurance  upon death 
see impact of new accounting standards section for a discussion of the company s adoption of statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts the sop in and the recording of a liability for gmdb in accordance with the provisions of the sop 
for the company s group disability policies  the level of reserves is based on a variety of factors including particular diagnoses  termination rates and benefit levels 
property casualty the hartford establishes property and casualty reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims made under policies written by the company 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported  and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
reserve estimates can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment 
potential external factors include changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care  hospital care  auto parts  wages and home repair  changes in the general economic environment that could cause unanticipated changes in the claim frequency per unit insured  changes in the litigious environment as evidenced by changes in claimant attorney representation in the claims negotiation and settlement process  changes in the judicial environment regarding the interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage and or the amount of damages awarded for certain types of damages  changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  changes in the regulatory environment regarding rates  rating plans and policy forms  changes in the legislative environment regarding the definition of damages and new types of injuries caused by new types of exposure to injury past examples include breast implants  tobacco products  lead paint  construction defects and blood product contamination 
reserve estimates can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations 
potential internal factors include periodic changes in claims handling procedures  growth in new lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established or changes in the quality of risk selection in the underwriting process 
in the case of reinsurance  all of the above risks apply 
in addition  changes in ceding company case reserving and reporting patterns create additional factors that need to be considered in estimating the reserves 
due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used  final claim settlements may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future 
the hartford  like other insurance companies  categorizes and tracks its insurance reserves for its segments by line of business  such as general liability  commercial multi peril  workers compensation  auto bodily injury  auto physical damage  homeowners and assumed reinsurance 
furthermore  the hartford regularly reviews the appropriateness of reserve levels at the line of business level  taking into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims for the subsets of claims in each particular line of business 
adjustments to previously established reserves  if any  are reflected in the operating results of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
in the judgment of management  all information currently available has been properly considered in the reserves established for claims and claim adjustment expenses 
the hartford is a multiline company in the property and casualty business 
the hartford is therefore subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from conditions  including but not limited to  those noted above  any of which could be material at any point in time for any segment 
certain issues may become more or less important over time as external or internal conditions change 
as various market conditions develop  management must assess whether those conditions constitute a long term trend that should result in a reserving action ie increasing or decreasing the reserve 
below is a discussion of certain market conditions that company management has observed during the company continues to carry the original incurred amount related to september  less any paid losses 
actual experience in some cases appears to be developing favorably to our original expectations  such as the higher than anticipated rate of participation in the victim s compensation fund 
there is still uncertainty  particularly with respect to coverage disputes and the potential for the emergence of latent injuries 
furthermore  the deadline for filing a liability claim with respect to september has been extended to march  as various deadlines pass and more coverage disputes are settled either outside of court or through a court decision  the uncertainty about various aspects of the reserves will likely be reduced 
the company will continue to evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis throughout and will make adjustments where appropriate 
within the commercial segments and the other operations segment  the company has exposure to losses from construction defects and other mass torts 
construction defect losses involve the allegation of property damage from poor construction 
the company also has exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long term or continuous exposure to harmful products or substances 
examples include  but are not limited to  pharmaceutical products  latex gloves  silica and lead paint 
such exposures involve potentially long latency periods and the spreading of coverage across years 
these factors make reserves for such claims more uncertain than other bodily injury or property damage claims 
in personal lines  reserving estimates are generally less variable than for the company s other property and casualty segments 
this is largely due to the coverages having relatively shorter periods of loss emergence 
estimates  however  can still vary due to a number of factors  including interpretations of frequency and severity trends and their impact on recorded reserve levels 
with respect to severity  the company s current accident year case reserves indicated a moderation in claim severity trends  which may be attributable in whole or in part to recent changes in internal claim practices 
changes in claim practices increase the uncertainty in the interpretation of case reserve data which  therefore  increases the uncertainty in recorded reserve levels 
in business insurance  workers compensation is the company s single biggest line and the line with the longest pattern of loss emergence 
reserve estimates for workers compensation are particularly sensitive to assumptions about medical inflation  which has been increasing steadily over the past few years 
in addition  changes in state legislative and regulatory environments impact the company s estimates 
in particular  the california environment has been very volatile 
the california legislature has recently passed a slate of reforms with the intention of reducing loss costs 
some of the reforms will impact open claims  and therefore  will potentially impact reserve estimates 
how these reforms will impact the amount and timing of loss payments is still unknown 
in the specialty commercial segment  many lines of insurance  such as excess insurance and deductible workers compensation insurance are long tailed lines of insurance 
for long tailed lines  the period of time between the incidence of the insured loss and either the reporting of the claim to the insurer  the settlement of the claim  or the payment of the claim can be substantial and in some cases several years 
as a result of this extended period of time for losses to emerge  reserve estimates for these lines are more uncertain ie more variable than reserve estimates for shorter tailed lines of insurance 
estimating required reserve levels for deductible workers compensation insurance is further complicated by the uncertainty of whether losses that are attributable to the deductible amount can be paid by the insured  if such losses are not paid by the insured due to financial difficulties  the company would be contractually liable 
another example of reserve variability relates to reserves for directors and officers insurance 
the required level of reserves for the recent financial and wall street scandals  including those involving the mutual fund industry  the investment banking industry and various highly publicized bankruptcies  is still uncertain 
in the reinsurance segments  much of the business is long tailed  reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to variability caused by extended loss emergence periods that were described for the specialty commercial segment 
in the case of assumed reinsurance  there is the added complexity of further reporting delays between the time of the incidence of the loss and the reporting of the claim to the direct insurer and the reporting by the direct insurer to the reinsurer 
there is also the complexity of the dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting of the ceding company 
and finally  there is the added variability caused by the reinsurer generally not having loss information as detailed as the direct insurer 
the company s reinsurance casualty business for accident years has proven particularly difficult to project 
in the opinion of management  based upon the known facts and current law  the reserves recorded for the hartford s property and casualty businesses at december  represent the company s best estimate of its ultimate liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses related to losses covered by policies written by the company 
however  because of the significant uncertainties surrounding environmental and particularly asbestos exposures  it is possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liabilities for these claims may change and that the required adjustment to recorded reserves could exceed the currently recorded reserves by an amount that could be material to the hartford s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
asbestos and environmental claims the hartford continues to receive claims that assert damages from asbestos related and environmental related exposures 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
the hartford wrote several different categories of insurance coverage to which asbestos and environmental claims may apply 
first  the hartford wrote direct policies as a primary liability insurance carrier 
second  the hartford wrote direct excess insurance policies providing additional coverage for insureds that exhausted their primary liability insurance coverage 
third  the hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other insurers writing primary  excess and reinsurance coverages 
fourth  the hartford participated as a london market company that wrote both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business 
in establishing reserves for asbestos and environmental claims  the hartford evaluates both each insured s probable liability for such claims and each insured s total available insurance coverage for such claims 
in evaluating each insured s probable liability for asbestos and environmental claims  the hartford considers a variety of factors that are unique to each insured 
with respect to each insured s probable liability for asbestos claims  these factors include the jurisdictions where underlying claims have been brought  past and anticipated future claim activity  past settlement values of similar claims  allocated claim adjustment expense  and potential bankruptcy impact 
the hartford s evaluation of each insured s probable liability for environmental claims involves consideration of similar factors  including historical values of similar claims  the number of sites involved  the insured s alleged activities at each site  the alleged environmental damage at each site  the respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties at each site  the appropriateness and cost of remediation at each site  the nature of governmental enforcement activities at each site  the ownership and general use of each site  and potential bankruptcy impact 
having evaluated the insured s probable liability for asbestos and or environmental claims  the hartford then evaluates each insured s insurance coverage program for such claims 
the hartford considers each insured s total available insurance coverage  including the coverage issued by the hartford 
this evaluation includes consideration of the number of years of coverage  applicable limits of liability  self insured retentions  deductibles  exclusions  insolvencies  and bare periods 
the hartford also considers relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations  if any  including in the case of asbestos claims whether some or all of the claims for which an insured seeks coverage are products or completed operations claims subject to aggregate limits 
for both asbestos and environmental reserves  the hartford also compares its historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience  and net loss and expense paid and incurred experience year by year  to assess any emerging trends  fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity 
once the gross ultimate exposure for indemnity and allocated claim adjustment expense is determined for each insured by each policy year  the hartford calculates its ceded reinsurance projection based on any applicable facultative and treaty reinsurance and the company s experience with reinsurance collections 
uncertainties regarding adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserves with regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims  significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related settlement expenses 
conventional reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims  particularly during periods where theories of law are in flux 
as a result of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs  the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other  more traditional exposures 
in particular  the hartford believes there is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves 
in the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate development patterns  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability  the risks inherent in major litigation  and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines 
courts have reached inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are applied  whether particular claims are product completed operation claims subject to an aggregate limit  and how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted 
furthermore  insurers in general  including the hartford  have recently experienced an increase in the number of asbestos related claims due to  among other things  more intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants  plaintiffs increased focus on new and previously peripheral defendants  and an increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
plaintiffs and insureds have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings including pre packaged bankruptcies to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers 
in addition  some policyholders have begun to assert new classes of claims for so called non products coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply 
recently  many insurers  including the hartford  also have been sued directly by asbestos claimants asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos 
management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
in the case of the reserves for environmental exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include court decisions that have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than originally intended  inconsistent decisions  especially across jurisdictions  and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured 
further uncertainties include the effect of the recent acceleration in the rate of bankruptcy filings by asbestos defendants on the rate and amount of the hartford s asbestos claims payments  a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims which cannot now be anticipated  whether some policyholders liabilities will reach the umbrella or excess layers of their coverage  the resolution or adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos claims in a manner inconsistent with the hartford s previous assessment of these claims  the number and outcome of direct actions against the hartford  and unanticipated developments pertaining to the hartford s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
additionally  the reporting pattern for excess insurance and reinsurance claims is much longer than direct claims 
in many instances  it takes months or years to determine that the customer s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims 
the delay in reporting reinsurance claims and exposures adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves 
given the factors and emerging trends described above  the hartford believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos exposures 
the hartford continually evaluates new information and new methodologies in assessing its potential asbestos exposures 
at any time  the hartford may be conducting an analysis of newly identified information 
completion of exposure analyses could cause the hartford to change its estimates of its asbestos reserves  and the effect of these changes could be material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
in the first quarter of  the hartford conducted a detailed study of its asbestos exposures 
the company undertook the study consistent with its practice of regularly updating its reserve estimates as new information becomes available 
the company strengthened its gross and net asbestos reserves by billion and billion  respectively  during the first quarter ended march  the process of estimating asbestos reserves remains subject to a wide variety of uncertainties  which are detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to these uncertainties  further developments could cause the hartford to change its estimates of asbestos reserves  and the effect of these changes could be material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
investments the hartford s investments in both fixed maturities  which include bonds  redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper and equity securities  which include common and non redeemable preferred stocks  are classified as available for sale as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  these securities are carried at fair value with the after tax difference from amortized cost  as adjusted for the effect of deducting the life and pension policyholders share of the immediate participation guaranteed contracts and certain life and annuity deferred policy acquisition costs  reflected in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
policy loans are carried at outstanding balance  which approximates fair value 
other investments primarily consist of limited partnership interests  derivatives and mortgage loans 
the limited partnerships are accounted for under the equity method and accordingly the partnership earnings are included in net investment income 
derivatives are carried at fair value and mortgage loans on real estate are recorded at the outstanding principal balance adjusted for amortization of premiums or discounts and net of valuation allowances  if any 
valuation of fixed maturities the fair value for fixed maturity securities is largely determined by one of three primary pricing methods independent third party pricing services  independent broker quotations or pricing matrices  which use data provided by external sources 
with the exception of short term securities for which amortized cost is predominantly used to approximate fair value  security pricing is applied using a hierarchy or waterfall approach whereby prices are first sought from independent pricing services with the remaining unpriced securities submitted to brokers for prices or lastly priced via a pricing matrix 
prices from independent pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  a significant percentage of the company s asset backed and commercial mortgage backed securities are priced via broker quotations 
a pricing matrix is used to price securities for which the company is unable to obtain either a price from a third party service or an independent broker quotation 
the pricing matrix begins with current treasury rates and uses credit spreads and issuer specific yield adjustments received from an independent third party source to determine the market price for the security 
the credit spreads incorporate the issuer s credit rating as assigned by a nationally recognized rating agency and a risk premium  if warranted  due to the issuer s industry and security s time to maturity 
the issuer specific yield adjustments  which can be positive or negative  are updated twice annually  as of june and december  by an independent third party source and are intended to adjust security prices for issuer specific factors 
the matrix priced securities at december  and  primarily consisted of non a private placements and have an average duration of the following table identifies the fair value of fixed maturity securities by pricing source as of december  and general and guaranteed percentage general and guaranteed percentage separate account fixed of total separate account fixed of total maturities at fair value fair value maturities at fair value fair value priced via independent market quotations   priced via broker quotations   priced via matrices   priced via other methods short term investments 
  total   total general accounts   total guaranteed separate accounts   
short term investments are valued at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
as such  the estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ significantly from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold immediately 
other than temporary impairments one of the significant estimations inherent in the valuation of investments is the evaluation of other than temporary impairments 
the evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates 
the company s accounting policy requires that a decline in the value of a security below its amortized cost basis be assessed to determine if the decline is other than temporary 
if so  the security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  and a charge is recorded in net realized capital losses equal to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of the security 
the fair value of the other than temporarily impaired investment becomes its new cost basis 
the company has a security monitoring process overseen by a committee of investment and accounting professionals that identifies securities that  due to certain characteristics  as described below  are subjected to an enhanced analysis on a quarterly basis 
securities not subject to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets non eitf issue no 
securities  that are depressed by twenty percent or more for six months are presumed to be other than temporarily impaired unless the depression is the result of rising interest rates or significant objective verifiable evidence supports that the security price is temporarily depressed and is expected to recover within a reasonable period of time 
non eitf issue no 
securities depressed less than twenty percent or depressed twenty percent or more but for less than six months are also reviewed to determine if an other than temporary impairment is present 
the primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value for non eitf issue no 
securities is other than temporary include a the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  b the financial condition  credit rating and near term prospects of the issuer  c whether the debtor is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments and d the intent and ability of the company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery 
for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  eitf issue no 
requires the company to periodically update its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized 
projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral 
for securities expected to be sold  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized if the company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover to amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale 
once an impairment charge has been recorded  the company continues to review the other than temporarily impaired securities for additional other than temporary impairments 
valuation of derivative instruments derivative instruments are reported at fair value based upon either independent market quotations for exchange traded derivative contracts  independent third party pricing sources or pricing valuation models which utilize independent third party data as inputs 
an embedded derivative instrument is reported at fair value based upon internally established valuations that are consistent with external valuation models  quotations furnished by dealers in such instrument or market quotations 
the company has calculated the fair value of the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb embedded derivative liability based on actuarial assumptions related to the projected cash flows  including benefits and related contract charges  over the lives of the contracts  incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows  stochastic techniques under a variety of market return scenarios and other best estimate assumptions are used 
estimating these cash flows involves numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those regarding expected market rates of return  market volatility  correlations of market returns and discount rates 
at each valuation date  the company assumes expected returns based on risk free rates as represented by the current libor forward curve rates  market volatility assumptions for each underlying index is based on a blend of observed market implied volatility data and annualized standard deviations of monthly returns using the most recent years of observed market performance  correlations of market returns across underlying indices is based on actual observed market returns and relationships over the ten years preceding the valuation date  and current risk free spot rates as represented by the current libor spot curve is used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows produced in the stochastic projection process 
deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits life policy acquisition costs  which include commissions and certain other expenses that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring business  are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts  usually years 
these deferred costs  together with the present value of future profits of acquired business  are recorded as an asset commonly referred to as deferred policy acquisition costs and present value of future profits dac 
at december  and  the carrying value of the company s life operations dac was billion and billion  respectively 
for statutory accounting purposes  such costs are expensed as incurred 
dac related to traditional policies are amortized over the premium paying period in proportion to the present value of annual expected premium income 
dac related to investment contracts and universal life type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method 
under the retrospective deposit method  acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross profits egps  arising principally from projected investment  mortality and expense margins and surrender charges 
the attributable portion of the dac amortization is allocated to realized gains and losses on investments 
the dac balance is also adjusted through other comprehensive income by an amount that represents the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs that would have been required as a charge or credit to operations had unrealized gains and losses on investments been realized 
actual gross profits can vary from management s estimates  resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of amortization 
the company regularly evaluates its egps to determine if actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
in the event that the company were to revise its egps  the cumulative dac amortization would be adjusted to reflect such revised egps in the period the revision was determined to be necessary 
several assumptions considered to be significant in the development of egps include separate account fund performance  surrender and lapse rates  estimated interest spread and estimated mortality 
the separate account fund performance assumption is critical to the development of the egps related to the company s variable annuity and to a lesser extent  variable universal life insurance businesses 
the average annual long term rate of assumed separate account fund performance before mortality and expense charges used in estimating gross profits for the variable annuity and variable universal life insurance business was for the years ended december  and for other products including fixed annuities and other universal life type contracts  the average assumed investment yield ranged from to for both years ended december  and the company has developed sophisticated modeling capabilities to evaluate its dac asset  which allowed it to run a large number of stochastically determined scenarios of separate account fund performance 
these scenarios were then utilized to calculate a statistically significant range of reasonable estimates of egps 
this range was then compared to the present value of egps currently utilized in the dac amortization model 
as of december   the present value of the egps utilized in the dac amortization model fall within a reasonable range of statistically calculated present value of egps 
as a result  the company does not believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that a revision to the egps and therefore  a revision to the dac as of december  is necessary  however  if in the future the egps utilized in the dac amortization model were to exceed the margin of the reasonable range of statistically calculated egps  a revision could be necessary 
furthermore  the company has estimated that the present value of the egps is likely to remain within a reasonable range if overall separate account returns decline by or less for  and if certain other assumptions that are implicit in the computations of the egps are achieved 
additionally  the company continues to perform analyses with respect to the potential impact of a revision to future egps 
if such a revision to egps were deemed necessary  the company would adjust  as appropriate  all of its assumptions for products accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments  and reproject its future egps based on current account values at the end of the quarter in which a revision is deemed to be necessary 
to illustrate the effects of this process  assume the company had concluded that a revision of the company s egps was required at december  if the company assumed a average long term rate of growth from december  forward along with other appropriate assumption changes in determining the revised egps  the company estimates the cumulative increase to amortization would be approximately  after tax 
if instead the company were to assume a long term growth rate of in determining the revised egps  the adjustment would be approximately  after tax 
assuming that such an adjustment were to have been required  the company anticipates that there would have been immaterial impacts on its dac amortization for the and years exclusive of the adjustment  and that there would have been positive earnings effects in later years 
any such adjustment would not affect statutory income or surplus  due to the prescribed accounting for such amounts that is discussed above 
aside from absolute levels and timing of market performance assumptions  additional factors that will influence this determination include the degree of volatility in separate account fund performance and shifts in asset allocation within the separate account made by policyholders 
the overall return generated by the separate account is dependent on several factors  including the relative mix of the underlying sub accounts among bond funds and equity funds as well as equity sector weightings 
the company s overall separate account fund performance has been reasonably correlated to the overall performance of the s p index which closed at  on december   although no assurance can be provided that this correlation will continue in the future 
the overall recoverability of the dac asset is dependent on the future profitability of the business 
the company tests the aggregate recoverability of the dac asset by comparing the amounts deferred to the present value of total egps 
in addition  the company routinely stress tests its dac asset for recoverability against severe declines in its separate account assets  which could occur if the equity markets experienced another significant sell off  as the majority of policyholders funds in the separate accounts is invested in the equity market 
as of december   the company believed variable annuity separate account assets could fall by at least before portions of its dac asset would be unrecoverable 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations pursuant to accounting principles related to the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations to employees under its various benefit plans  the company is required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the related liabilities and expenses each period 
the two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
in determining the discount rate assumption  the company utilizes current market information provided by its plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of the company s pension obligation and general movements in the current market environment 
in particular  the company uses an interest rate yield curve developed by its plan actuaries 
the yield curve is comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
based on all available information  it was determined that is the appropriate discount rate as of december  to calculate the company s accrued benefit cost liability 
accordingly  the discount rate will also be used to determine the company s pension expense 
at december  the discount rate was 
the company determines the long term rate of return assumption for the pension plan s asset portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio s historical rates of return balanced with future long term return expectations 
based on its long term outlook with respect to the markets  which has been influenced by the poor equity market performance in recent years as well as the recent decline in fixed income security yields  the company lowered its long term rate of return assumption from to as of december  to illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for and going forward  a basis point change in the discount rate will increase decrease pension expense by approximately and a basis point change in the long term asset return assumption will increase decrease pension expense by approximately contingencies management follows the requirements of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
this statement requires management to evaluate each contingent matter separately 
the evaluation is a two step process  including determining a likelihood of loss  and  if a loss is probable  developing a potential range of loss 
management establishes reserves for these contingencies at its best estimate  or  if no one number within the range of possible losses is more probable than any other  the company records an estimated reserve at the low end of the range of losses 
the majority of contingencies currently being evaluated by the company relate to litigation and tax matters  which are inherently difficult to evaluate and subject to significant changes

compared to revenues increased as a result of realized gains in as compared to realized losses in see the investments section for further discussion of investment results and related realized capital gains and losses 
also contributing to the increased revenues were higher earned premiums and net investment income in the investment products segment as compared to the prior year 
the increase in earned premiums in investment products is attributed to higher sales in the institutional investment products business specifically in the terminal funding and structured settlement businesses 
additionally  net investment income increased due to higher general account assets in the individual annuity business and growth in assets in the institutional investments business 
fee income in the investment products segment was higher in compared to a year ago  as a result of higher average account values  specifically in individual annuities and mutual fund businesses  due primarily to stronger variable annuity sales 
the individual life segment reported an increase in revenues in compared to a year ago driven by increases in fees and cost of insurance as life insurance in force grew and aged  and variable universal life account values increased due primarily to the growth in the equity markets 
in addition  group benefits experienced an increase in revenues driven by increases in net investment income and earned premiums in as compared to a year ago 
partially offsetting these increases were lower fee income and net investment income in the coli segment 
the decrease in coli net investment income for was primarily due to lower average leveraged coli account values as a result of surrender activity 
in addition  coli had lower fee income due in part to lower sales in  as compared to the prior year 
benefits  claims and expenses increased primarily due to increases in the investment products segment associated with the growth in the individual annuity and institutional investments businesses discussed above 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in interest credited expenses in coli related to the decline in leveraged coli account values

additionally  group benefits net income increased due principally to more favorable claims experience as compared to the prior year and continued expense management 
individual life experienced earnings growth in due to increases in fee income  favorable mortality and growth in the in force business 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in coli net income of for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year period 
this decrease includes the effects of a year over year increase of in the charge for the bancorp litigation 
in addition  there was an after tax impact recorded in the first quarter of related to favorable development on the company s estimated september exposure 
the effective tax rate increased in when compared with as a result of higher earnings and lower dividends received deduction drd related tax items 
the tax provision recorded during reflects a benefit of  consisting primarily of a change in estimate of the drd tax benefit reported during the change in estimate was the result of actual investment performance on the related separate accounts being unexpectedly out of pattern with past performance  which had been the basis for the estimate 
this compares with a tax benefit of recorded in see note of notes consolidated financial statements 
the total drd benefit related to the tax year for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  compared to revenues decreased  primarily driven by an increase in realized capital losses in as compared to the prior year 
see the investments section for further discussion of investment results and related realized capital losses 
additionally  coli experienced a decline in revenues  as a result of the decrease in leveraged coli account values as compared to a year ago  which was partially offset by revenue growth across the other operating segments 
revenues related to the investment products segment decreased  as a result of lower earned premiums in the institutional investment product business  and a decline in revenues within the individual annuity operation 
lower assets under management due to the decline in the equity markets are the principal driver of declining revenues for the individual annuity operation 
the group benefits segment experienced an increase in revenues  as a result of strong sales to new customers and solid persistency within the in force block of business 
additionally  individual life revenues increased  as a result of increased life insurance in force and the fortis acquisition 
total benefits  claims and expenses decreased due primarily to the revenue changes described above 
expenses decreased in the investment products segment  principally due to a lower change in reserve as a result of the lower earned premiums discussed above and a increase in death benefits related to the individual annuity operation  as a result of depressed contractholder account values driven by the lower equity markets

the company is both a leading writer of individual variable annuities and a top seller of individual variable annuities through banks in the united states 
compared to revenues in the investment products segment increased primarily driven by higher earned premiums and higher net investment income 
the increase in earned premiums is due to higher sales of terminal funding and structured settlement products in the institutional investment products business 
net investment income increased due to higher general account assets 
general account assets for the individual annuity business were billion as of december   an increase of approximately or from  due primarily to an increase in individual annuity sales  with the majority of those new sales electing to use the dollar cost averaging dca feature 
the dca feature allows policyholders to earn a credited interest rate in the general account for a defined period of time as their invested assets are systematically invested into the separate account funds 
additionally  net investment income related to other investment products increased as a result of the growth in average assets over the last twelve months in the institutional investment business  where related general account assets under management increased billion  since december   to billion as of december  assets under management is an internal performance measure used by the company since a significant portion of the company s revenue is based upon asset values 
these revenues increase or decrease with a rise or fall  respectively  in the level of average assets under management 
fee income in the investment products segment was higher in compared to a year ago  as a result of higher average account values  specifically in individual annuities and mutual fund businesses  due primarily to stronger variable annuity sales and the higher equity market values compared to the prior year 
total benefits  claims and expenses increased primarily due to higher terminal funding and structured settlement sales in the institutional investment business causing an increase in reserve levels and increased interest credited in the individual annuity operation as a result of higher general account asset levels 
additionally  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs related to the individual annuity business increased due to higher gross profits 
net income was higher driven by an increase in revenues in the individual annuity and other investment product operations as a result of the strong net flows and growth in the equity markets during and strong expense management 
in addition  net income increased in compared to due to the favorable impact of  resulting from the company s previously discussed change in estimate of the drd tax benefit reported during the change in estimate was the result of actual investment performance on the related separate accounts being unexpectedly out of pattern with past performance  which had been the basis for the estimate 
the total drd benefit related to the tax year for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  compared to revenues in the investment products segment decreased primarily due to lower earned premiums in the institutional investment products business and lower fee income related to the individual annuity operation as average account values decreased from billion to billion compared to prior year  primarily due to the lower equity markets 
partially offsetting these declines was an increase in net investment income  primarily driven by growth in the institutional investment product business  where related assets under management increased  or  to billion as of december  total benefits  claims and expenses decreased  due primarily to a lower change in reserve as a result of the lower earned premiums discussed above 
additionally  there was a decrease in amortization of policy acquisition costs related to the individual annuity business  which declined as a result of lower gross profits  driven by the decrease in fee income and the increase in death benefit costs 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases of  or  in interest credited on general account assets   or  in commissions and wholesaling expenses  and in individual annuity death benefit costs due to the lower equity markets 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the mutual fund business 
net income decreased  driven by the lower equity markets resulting in the decline in revenues in the individual annuity operation and increases in the death benefit costs incurred by the individual annuity operation 
outlook management believes the market for retirement products continues to expand as individuals increasingly save and plan for retirement 
demographic trends suggest that as the baby boom generation matures  a significant portion of the united states population will allocate a greater percentage of their disposable incomes to saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty surrounding the social security system and increases in average life expectancy 
in addition  the company believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to maintain and enhance its position as a market leader in the financial services industry 
this was demonstrated by record individual annuity sales in of billion a increase compared to billion and billion in and  respectively 
significantly contributing to the growth in sales was the introduction of principal first  a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider  which was developed in response to our customers needs 
however  the competition is increasing in this market and as a result  the company may not be able to sustain the level of sales attained in based on vards  the company had market share as of december  as compared to at december  additionally  in the hartford mutual funds reached billion in assets faster than any other retail oriented mutual fund family in history  according to strategic insight 
the growth and profitability of the individual annuity and mutual fund businesses is dependent to a large degree on the performance of the equity markets 
in periods of favorable equity market performance  the company may experience stronger sales and higher net cash flows  which will increase assets under management and thus increase fee income earned on those assets 
in addition  higher equity market levels will generally reduce certain costs to the company of individual annuities  such as gmdb and gmwb benefits 
conversely though  weak equity markets may dampen sales activity and increase surrender activity causing declines in assets under management and lower fee income 
such declines in the equity markets will also increase the cost to the company of gmdb and gmwb benefits associated with individual annuities 
the company attempts to mitigate some of the volatility associated with the gmdb and gmwb benefits using reinsurance or other risk management strategies  such as hedging 
future net income for the company will be affected by the effectiveness of the risk management strategies the company has implemented to mitigate the net income volatility associated with the gmdb and gmwb benefits of variable annuity contracts 
for spread based products sold in the investment products segment  the future growth will depend on the ability to earn targeted returns on new business  given competition and the future interest rate environment

earned premiums  which include premiums for ceded reinsurance  decreased primarily due to increased use of reinsurance 
total benefits  claims and expenses increased  principally driven by an increase in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in benefit costs in as compared to due to favorable mortality rates compared to the prior year 
net income increased due to increases in fee income and unusually favorable mortality 
additionally  net income for the year ended december  includes the favorable impact of drd benefit resulting from the company s previously discussed change in estimate of the drd tax benefit reported during the total drd benefit related to the tax year for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  compared to revenues in the individual life segment increased  primarily driven by business growth including the impact of the fortis transaction

in addition  mortality rates for increased as compared to the prior year  but were in line with management s expectations 
individual life s earnings increased for the year ended december   principally due to the contribution to earnings from the fortis transaction 
the increase in net income was also impacted by an after tax loss of related to september in the third quarter of outlook the individual life segment benefited from unusually favorable mortality during the fourth quarter 
it is not anticipated that similar experience would be likely to continue 
individual life sales grew to in from in with the successful introduction of new universal life and whole life products 
improved equity markets should help increase variable universal life sales 
the company also continues to introduce new and enhanced products  which are expected to increase sales

compared to revenues in the group benefits segment increased in as compared to  driven by increases in earned premiums and other and net investment income in as compared to a year ago 
premiums growth was not as high as anticipated due to lower sales to new customers in and lower persistency on renewals reflecting a competitive marketplace 
however  the segment reported an increase in total buyout premiums 
buyouts involve the acquisition of claim liabilities from another carrier for a purchase price calculated to cover the run off of those liabilities plus administration expenses and profit 
due to the nature of the buyout marketplace  the predictability of buyout premiums is uncertain 
total benefits  claims and expenses increased for the year ended december   which is consistent with the increase in buyout premiums previously described 
excluding buyouts  total benefits  claims and expenses decreased  or  over the same period 
the segment s loss ratio defined as benefits  claims and claim adjustment expenses as a percentage of premiums and other considerations excluding buyouts was  down from in insurance operating costs and other expenses increased due to the premium growth previously described and continued investments in technology  service and distribution 
the segment s ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses to premiums and other considerations was  increasing slightly from in the increase in net income was due primarily to favorable claims experience 
compared to revenues in the group benefits segment increased  driven primarily by growth in premiums  which increased in as compared to the growth in premiums was due to an increase in fully insured ongoing premiums  as a result of steady persistency and pricing actions on the in force block of business and strong sales 
fully insured ongoing sales were  an increase of  or 
offsetting this increase was a decrease in military medicare supplement premiums resulting from federal legislation effective in the fourth quarter of this legislation provides retired military officers age and older with full medical insurance paid for by the government  eliminating the need for medicare supplement insurance 
additionally  premium revenues for were partially offset by a decrease in total buyout premiums 
total benefits  claims and expenses increased from to the increase in expenses is consistent with the growth in revenues previously described

the segment s ratio of insurance operating costs and other expenses to premiums and other considerations was  consistent with prior year 
the increase in net income was due to the increase in premium revenues and favorable loss costs  which was partially offset by increased insurance operating costs and other expenses as previously described 
group benefits incurred an after tax loss of related to september in the third quarter of outlook despite the current market conditions  including low interest rates  rising medical costs  the changing regulatory environment and cost containment pressure on employers  the group benefits segment continues to leverage off of its strength in claim and risk management  service and distribution  enabling the company to capitalize on market opportunities 
additionally  employees continue to look to the workplace for a broader and ever expanding array of insurance products 
as employers design benefit strategies to attract and retain employees  while attempting to control their benefit costs  management believes that the need for the group benefits segment s products will continue to expand 
this  combined with the significant number of employees who currently do not have coverage or adequate levels of coverage  creates unique opportunities for our products and services 
furthermore  on december   the company acquired the group life and accident  and short term and long term disability businesses of cna financial corporation 
this acquisition will increase the scale of the company s group life and disability operations and expand the company s distribution of its products and services 
this acquisition is expected to be slightly accretive to earnings in please refer to subsequent events in the stockholders equity section of the capital resources and liquidity section for information on the financing of this transaction

until the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  the company sold two principal types of coli business leveraged and variable products 
leveraged coli is a fixed premium life insurance policy owned by a company or a trust sponsored by a company 
hipaa phased out the deductibility of interest on policy loans under leveraged coli through the end of  virtually eliminating all future sales of this product 
variable coli continues to be a product used by employers to fund non qualified benefits or other post employment benefit liabilities 
compared to coli revenues decreased  primarily driven by lower net investment and fee income 
net investment income and fee income decreased due to the decline in leveraged coli account values as a result of surrender activity 
fee income also decreased as the result of lower sales volume in as compared to prior year 
total benefits  claims and expenses decreased in  primarily as a result of a decline in interest credited 
this was due to the decline in general account assets as compared to this is related to the surrender activity noted above 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in insurance operating costs and expenses due primarily to a after tax expense  related to the bancorp litigation expense recorded in compared with the after tax expense recorded in for a discussion of the bancorp litigation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

however  the decrease was partially offset by an after tax expense related to the bancorp litigation 
coli s net income decreased principally due to the after tax expense accrued in connection with the bancorp litigation 
the decrease in net income was also impacted by an after tax loss of related to september recorded in the third quarter of outlook the focus of this segment is variable coli  which continues to be a product generally used by employers to fund non qualified benefits or other post employment benefit liabilities 
the leveraged coli product has been an important contributor to the hartford s profitability in recent years and will continue to contribute to the profitability of the company in the future  although the level of profit has declined in  compared to coli continues to be subject to a changing legislative and regulatory environment that could have a material adverse effect on its business

compared to revenues for property casualty increased billion for the year ended december  the improvement was due primarily to earned premium growth in the business insurance  specialty commercial and personal lines segments  primarily as a result of earned pricing increases  as well as an improvement in net realized capital gains and losses  and net investment income 
partially offsetting the increase was a earned premium decline in the reinsurance segment as a result of the company s decision to withdraw from the assumed reinsurance business as discussed more fully below 
on may   as part of the company s decision to withdraw from the assumed reinsurance business  the company entered into a quota share and purchase agreement with endurance reinsurance corporation of america endurance whereby the reinsurance segment retroceded the majority of its inforce book of business as of april  and sold renewal rights to endurance 
under the quota share agreement  endurance reinsured most of the segment s assumed reinsurance contracts that were written on or after january  and that had unearned premium as of april  in consideration for endurance reinsuring the unearned premium as of april   the company paid endurance an amount equal to unearned premiums less the related unamortized commissions deferred acquisition costs net of an override commission  which was established by the contract 
in addition  endurance will pay a profit sharing commission based on the loss performance of property treaty  property catastrophe and aviation pool unearned premium 
under the purchase agreement  endurance will pay additional amounts  subject to a guaranteed minimum of  based on the level of renewal premium on the reinsured contracts over the two year period following the agreement 
the guaranteed minimum is reflected in net income for the year ended december  the company remains subject to ongoing reserve development relating to all retained business 
net income decreased billion for the year ended december  primarily due to the net asbestos reserve strengthening of billion  after tax  in the first quarter 
results for the year were favorably impacted by an increase in net realized capital gains losses and improved underwriting results in the personal lines and business insurance segments 
strong earned pricing and favorable frequency loss costs resulted in an increase in underwriting results in both the personal lines and business insurance segments 
in addition  net investment income  after tax  rose for the year ended december  due to higher invested assets  primarily from strong cash flows and additional capital raised during the second quarter of on september   the company sold a wholly owned subsidiary  trumbull associates  llc  for  resulting in a gain of  after tax 
the gain is included in net realized capital gains 
the revenues and net income of trumbull associates  llc were not material to the company or the property casualty operation 
compared to revenues for property casualty increased  or  for the year ended december  the improvement was due primarily to earned premium growth in the business insurance  personal lines and specialty commercial segments  primarily as a result of earned pricing increases 
the reinsurance cessions related to september increased the earned premium variance for the year by partially offsetting the increase was a decline in earned premium in the reinsurance segment due to the exclusion of the exited international business  which in january was transferred to other operations  and a reduction in the alternative risk transfer line of business 
a decrease in net realized capital losses and improvement in net investment income also contributed to the increase in revenues 
net income increased primarily due to after tax losses related to september of in  improved underwriting results across each of the north american underwriting segments  particularly in specialty commercial and reinsurance  and a decrease in net realized capital losses 
partially offsetting the improvement was an increase in other expenses primarily as a result of an increase in e business research and development expenses and certain employee benefits costs  as well as expenses incurred related to the transfer of the company s new jersey personal lines agency auto business to palisades safety and insurance association and palisades insurance co 
ratios the previous table and the following segment discussions for the years ended december   and include various underwriting ratios 
management believes that these ratios are useful in understanding the underlying trends in the hartford s current insurance underwriting business 
however  these measures should only be used in conjunction with  and not in lieu of  underwriting income and net income for the combined property and casualty segments and may not be comparable to other performance measures used by the company s competitors 
the loss ratio is the ratio of claims expense exclusive of claim adjustment expenses to earned premiums 
the loss adjustment expense ratio represents the ratio of claim adjustment expenses to earned premiums 
the loss and loss expense incurred ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios 
the expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses  excluding bad debt expense  to earned premiums 
the policyholder dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholder dividends to earned premiums 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio  the loss adjustment expense ratio  the expense ratio and the policyholder dividend ratio 
these ratios are relative measurements that describe for every of net premiums earned  the cost of losses and expenses as defined above  respectively 
a combined ratio below demonstrates underwriting profit  a combined ratio above demonstrates underwriting losses 
the loss and loss expense paid ratio represents the ratio of paid claims and claim adjustment expenses to earned premiums 
the catastrophe ratio represents the ratio of catastrophe losses to earned premiums 
a catastrophe is an event that causes or more in industry insured property losses and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers 
premium measures written premiums are a non gaap financial measure which represents the amount of premiums charged for policies issued during a fiscal period 
earned premiums is a gaap measure 
premiums are considered earned and are included in the financial results on a pro rata basis over the policy period 
the following segment discussions for the years ended december    and respectively  include the presentation of written premiums in addition to earned premiums 
management believes that this performance measure is useful to investors as it reflects current trends in the company s sale of property and casualty insurance products  as compared to earned premium 
premium renewal retention is defined as renewal premium written in the current period divided by total premium written in the prior period 
reinstatement premium represents additional ceded premium paid for the reinstatement of the amount of reinsurance coverage that was reduced as a result of a reinsurance loss payment 
risk management strategy the hartford s property and casualty operations have well developed processes to manage catastrophic risk exposures to natural catastrophes  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  and other perils  such as terrorism 
these processes involve establishing underwriting guidelines for both individual risk and in aggregate including individual policy limits and aggregate exposure limits by geographic zone and peril 
the company establishes exposure limits and actively monitors the risk exposures as a percent of north american property casualty surplus 
generally the company limits its exposure from a single year event to less than of statutory surplus for losses prior to reinsurance and to less than of statutory surplus for losses net of reinsurance 
the company monitors exposures monthly and employs both internally developed and externally purchased loss modeling tools 
the hartford utilizes reinsurance to manage risk and transfer exposures to well established and financially secure reinsurers 
reinsurance is used to manage both aggregate exposures as well as specific risks based on accumulated property and casualty liabilities in certain geographic zones 
all treaty purchases are administered by a centralized function to support a consistent strategy and ensure that the reinsurance activities are fully integrated into the organization s risk management processes 
a variety of traditional reinsurance products are used in the development and execution of the overall corporate risk management strategy 
the risk transfer products used include both excess of loss occurrence based products  protecting aggregate property and workers compensation exposures  and individual risk or quota share products  protecting specific classes or lines of business 
finite risk products may be used on a limited basis as a cost effective alternative to traditional products 
there are currently no significant finite risk contracts in place and the current statutory surplus benefit from all such prior year contracts is immaterial 
facultative reinsurance is also used to manage policy specific risk exposures based on established underwriting guidelines 
the hartford also participates in governmentally administered reinsurance facilities such as the florida hurricane catastrophe fund fhcf 
to minimize the potential credit risk resulting from the use of reinsurance  a centralized group evaluates the credit standing of potential reinsurers and establishes the company s schedule of approved reinsurers 
the assessment process reviews reinsurers against a set of predetermined financial and management criteria and distinguishes between long tail casualty and short tail property business 
a committee meets regularly to review activity with each reinsurer and affirm the schedule of approved reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables the company s net reinsurance recoverables from various property and casualty reinsurance arrangements amounted to billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
of the total net reinsurance recoverables as of december   relates to the company s mandatory participation in various involuntary assigned risk pools  which are backed by the financial strength of the property and casualty insurance industry 
of the remainder  billion  or  was due from companies rated by am best 
of the total rated by am best  of the companies were rated a excellent or better 
the remaining billion  or  of net recoverables from reinsurers was comprised of the following related to voluntary pools  related to captive insurance companies  and related to companies not rated by am best 
where its contracts permit  the company secures its collection of these future claim obligations with various forms of collateral including irrevocable letters of credit  secured trusts such as new york regulation trusts  funds held accounts and group wide offsets 
the net recoverables include an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance was and at december  and  respectively 
the significant increase was primarily related to the company s asbestos reserve strengthening actions during the first quarter of the company s allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance is regularly reviewed based on management s assessment of the credit quality of its reinsurers as well as an estimate for the cost if any of resolution of reinsurer disputes 
reserves reserving for property and casualty losses is an estimation process 
as additional experience and other relevant claim data become available  reserve levels are adjusted accordingly 
such adjustments of reserves related to claims incurred in prior years are a natural occurrence in the loss reserving process and are referred to as reserve development 
reserve development that increases previous estimates of ultimate cost is called reserve strengthening 
reserve development that decreases previous estimates of ultimate cost is called reserve releases 
reserve development can influence the comparability of year over year underwriting results and is set forth in the paragraphs and tables that follow 
the prior accident year development pts 
in the following tables for the years ended december   and represents the ratio of reserve development to earned premiums 
for a detailed discussion of the company s reserve policies  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements and the critical accounting estimates section of the md a 
for the year ended december  there was no significant reserve strengthening or release in the business insurance and personal lines segments for the year ended december  specialty commercial strengthened prior accident year reserves by for the year ended december  primarily as a result of losses in the bond and professional liability lines of business 
the bond reserve strengthening was isolated to a few severe contract surety claims related to accident year the professional liability reserve strengthening involved a provision for anticipated settlements of reinsurance obligations for contracts outstanding at the time of the original acquisition of reliance group holdings auto residual value portfolio in the third quarter of reserve strengthening of in the reinsurance segment for the year occurred across multiple accident years  primarily through  and principally in the casualty line of traditional reinsurance 
in addition  the other operations segment for the year ended december  reflects the company s net asbestos reserve strengthening of billion during the first quarter of for the year ended december  reserve strengthening in the business insurance segment for the year ended december  was not significant 
in personal lines  prior accident year loss and loss adjustment expenses for non standard auto were strengthened due to heavier than expected frequency  severity and litigation rates on prior accident years 
in addition  the prior accident year provision was increased modestly for mold losses 
virtually all of the strengthening in specialty commercial is due to deductible workers compensation losses on a few large accounts 
reserve strengthening in the reinsurance segment occurred across multiple accident years  primarily through  and across several lines of business 
high reported losses from ceding companies have persisted throughout and loss ratios have been revised upward 
virtually all of the reserve strengthening in the other operations segment related to asbestos 
for the year ended december  there was little reserve strengthening or weakening by segment in with the exception of other operations  where the strengthening was related primarily to non asbestos and environmental exposures

impact of re estimates as explained in connection with the company s discussion of critical accounting estimates  the establishment of property and casualty reserves is an estimation process 
ultimate losses may vary significantly from the current estimates 
many factors can contribute to these variations and the need to subsequently change the previous estimate of required reserve levels 
subsequent changes can generally be thought of as being the result of the emergence of additional facts that were not known or anticipated at the time of the prior reserve estimate and or changes in interpretations of information and trends 
the table below shows the range of reserve re estimates experienced by the hartford over the past three years 
the amount of prior accident year development as shown in the reserve rollforward for a given year is expressed as a percent of the beginning reserves 
the range below represents the range of such calculations for the last three years 
the percentage relationships presented are significantly influenced by the facts and circumstances of each particular year and by the fact that only the last three years are included in the range 
accordingly  these percentages are not intended to be a prediction of the range of possible future variability

before the billion of reserve strengthening for asbestos during  over the past five years  reserve re estimates for total property casualty ranged from to 
the potential variability of the company s property and casualty reserves would normally be expected to vary by segment and the types of loss exposures insured by those segments 
illustrative factors influencing the potential reserve variability for each of the segments are discussed under critical accounting estimates 
in general  the company would expect the variability of its personal lines reserve estimates to be relatively less than the variability of the reserve estimates for its other property and casualty segments 
the company would expect the degree of variability of the other segment s reserve estimates  from lower variability to higher variability  to be generally business insurance  specialty commercial  reinsurance  and other operations 
the actual relative variability could prove to be different

on may   the company entered into a quota share and purchase agreement with endurance reinsurance corporation of america endurance  whereby the reinsurance segment retroceded the majority of its inforce book of business as of april  and sold renewal rights to endurance 
under the quota share agreement  endurance reinsured most of the segment s assumed reinsurance contracts that were written on or after january  and that had unearned premium as of april  in consideration for endurance reinsuring the unearned premium as of april   the company paid endurance an amount equal to unearned premium less the related unamortized commissions deferred acquisition costs net of an override commission which was established by the contract 
in addition  endurance will pay a profit sharing commission based on the loss performance of property treaty  property catastrophe and aviation pool unearned premium 
under the purchase agreement  endurance will pay additional amounts  subject to a guaranteed minimum of  based on the level of renewal premium on the reinsured contracts over the two year period following the agreement 
the guaranteed minimum is reflected in net income for the year ended december  the company remains subject to reserve development relating to all retained business 
prior to the endurance transaction  the reinsurance segment assumed reinsurance in north america and primarily wrote treaty reinsurance through professional reinsurance brokers covering various property  casualty  property catastrophe  marine and alternative risk transfer art products 
art included non traditional reinsurance products such as multi year property catastrophe treaties  aggregate of excess of loss agreements and quota share treaties with single event caps 
international property catastrophe  marine and art were also written outside of north america through a london contact office 
compared to reinsurance written premiums decreased  or  and earned premiums decreased  or  primarily due to the company s decision to withdraw from the assumed reinsurance business as discussed above 
the decrease in written premiums also reflects the cession of the unearned premium to endurance related to certain contracts written by the company prior to april  underwriting losses increased  with a corresponding point increase in the combined ratio  primarily as a result of underwriting losses on the business not ceded to endurance and adverse loss development on prior underwriting years  primarily through  particularly in the casualty lines of traditional reinsurance 
compared to reinsurance written premiums decreased including of reinsurance cessions related to september  or  and earned premiums decreased including related to september  or  due to the exclusion of the exited international business  which in january  was transferred to other operations  and a reduction in the art line of business 
written and earned premiums from the international business in were and  respectively 
art written and earned premiums decreased  or  and  or  respectively  due primarily to the expiration of a non recurring loss portfolio reinsurance contract and the non renewal of a quota share treaty with one ceding company 
excluding art  international and the impact of september  written premiums increased  or  and earned premiums increased  or  due primarily to significant pricing increases as a result of continued market firming  substantially offset by premium reductions due to underwriting requirements to maintain profitability targets 
underwriting results improved including of underwriting loss related to september  with a corresponding point decrease including a point impact related to september in the combined ratio 
the improvement in underwriting results and combined ratio before september was primarily due to underwriting initiatives including a shift to excess of loss policies and increased property business mix  as well as the exit from nearly all international lines  an intense focus on returns and lower catastrophes 
underwriting results and the combined ratio were negatively impacted by adverse loss development on prior underwriting years 
outlook the company exited the assumed reinsurance business during in connection therewith  the company will continue to manage the runoff of premium and the settlement of claims 
the company remains subject to reserve development relating to all retained business 
other operations including asbestos and environmental claims operating summary written premiums change in unearned premium reserve earned premiums benefits  claims and claim adjustment expenses  amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs insurance operating costs and expenses underwriting results  the other operations segment includes operations that are under a single management structure  heritage holdings  which was finalized in late to be responsible for two related activities 
the first activity is the management of certain subsidiaries and operations of the hartford that have discontinued writing new business 
the second is the management of claims and the associated reserves related to asbestos and environmental exposures 
the companies in this segment which are not writing new business include first state insurance company and two affiliated subsidiaries  located in boston  massachusetts  heritage reinsurance company  ltd heritage re  headquartered in bermuda  and excess insurance company  ltd  located in the united kingdom 
each of these companies is primarily focused on managing claims  resolving disputes and collecting reinsurance proceeds 
while the business that was written in these units on either a direct or reinsurance basis spanned a wide variety of insurance and reinsurance policies and coverages  a significant and increasing proportion of current and future claims activity arising from these businesses relates to environmental and  to a greater extent  asbestos exposures 
other operations also includes the results of the hartford s international property casualty businesses substantially all of which were disposed of in a series of transactions concluding in and the international businesses of the reinsurance segment  exited in the fourth quarter of compared to the decline in written and earned premiums was due to the runoff of the international assumed reinsurance business that was transferred to the other operations segment in january the underwriting loss was due primarily to the first quarter net asbestos reserve strengthening of billion as discussed in the section that follows 
compared to the increase in written and earned premiums reflects the january transfer of the exited international business of the reinsurance segment to other operations in january the paragraphs that follow are background information and a discussion of asbestos and environmental claims  the deteriorating trends with respect to asbestos  and a summary of the company s detailed study of asbestos reserves 
asbestos and environmental claims the hartford continues to receive asbestos and environmental claims  both of which affect other operations 
these claims are made pursuant to several different categories of insurance coverage 
first  the hartford wrote direct policies as a primary liability insurance carrier 
second  the hartford wrote direct excess insurance policies providing additional coverage for insureds that exhaust their underlying liability insurance coverage 
third  the hartford acted as a reinsurer assuming a portion of risks previously assumed by other insurers writing primary  excess and reinsurance coverages 
fourth  the hartford participated as a london market company that wrote both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance business 
with regard to both environmental and particularly asbestos claims  significant uncertainty limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to estimate the ultimate reserves necessary for unpaid losses and related expenses 
traditional actuarial reserving techniques cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate cost of these claims  particularly during periods when theories of law are in flux 
as a result of the factors discussed in the following paragraphs  the degree of variability of reserve estimates for these exposures is significantly greater than for other more traditional exposures 
in particular  the hartford believes there is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the estimation of asbestos loss reserves 
in the case of the reserves for asbestos exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include inadequate development patterns  plaintiffs expanding theories of liability  the risks inherent in major litigation  and inconsistent emerging legal doctrines 
courts have reached inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage  what types of losses are covered  whether there is an insurer obligation to defend  how policy limits are applied  whether particular claims are product completed operation claims subject to an aggregate limit  and how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted 
furthermore  insurers in general  including the hartford  have recently experienced an increase in the number of asbestos related claims due to  among other things  more intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants  plaintiffs increased focus on new and previously peripheral defendants  and an increase in the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
plaintiffs and insureds have sought to use bankruptcy proceedings  including pre packaged bankruptcies  to accelerate and increase loss payments by insurers 
in addition  some policyholders have begun to assert new classes of claims for so called non products coverages to which an aggregate limit of liability may not apply 
recently  many insurers  including the hartford  also have been sued directly by asbestos claimants asserting that insurers had a duty to protect the public from the dangers of asbestos 
management believes these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
further uncertainties include the effect of the recent acceleration in the rate of bankruptcy filings by asbestos defendants on the rate and amount of the hartford s asbestos claims payments  a further increase or decrease in asbestos and environmental claims that cannot now be anticipated  whether some policyholders liabilities will reach the umbrella or excess layers of their coverage  the resolution or adjudication of some disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos claims in a manner inconsistent with the hartford s previous assessment of these claims  the number and outcome of direct actions against the hartford  and unanticipated developments pertaining to the hartford s ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims 
it is also not possible to predict changes in the legal and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims 
it is unknown whether a potential federal bill concerning asbestos litigation approved by the senate judiciary committee  or some other potential federal asbestos related legislation  will be enacted and  if so  what its effect will be on the hartford s aggregate asbestos liabilities 
additionally  the reporting pattern for excess insurance and reinsurance claims is much longer than direct claims 
in many instances  it takes months or years to determine that the policyholder s own obligations have been met and how the reinsurance in question may apply to such claims 
the delay in reporting excess and reinsurance claims adds to the uncertainty of estimating the related reserves 
in the case of the reserves for environmental exposures  factors contributing to the high degree of uncertainty include court decisions that have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than originally intended  inconsistent decisions  especially across jurisdictions  and uncertainty as to the monetary amount being sought by the claimant from the insured 
given the factors and emerging trends described above  the hartford believes the actuarial tools and other techniques it employs to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional kinds of insurance exposure are less precise in estimating reserves for its asbestos and environmental exposures 
the hartford regularly evaluates new information in assessing its potential asbestos and environmental exposures 
reserve activity reserves and reserve activity in the other operations segment are categorized and reported as asbestos  environmental or all other activity 
the discussion below relates to reserves and reserve activity  net of applicable reinsurance 
there are a wide variety of claims that drive the reserves associated with asbestos  environmental and the all other category the company has included in other operations 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean up costs 
the all other category of reserves covers a wide range of exposures  including potential liability for breast implants  blood products  construction defects  lead paint and other long tail liabilities 
the other operations historic book of business contains policies written from the s to  with the majority of the business spanning the interval to the hartford s experience has been that this book of business has over time produced significantly higher claims and losses than were contemplated at inception 
the areas of active claim activity have also shifted based on changes in plaintiff focus and the overall litigation environment 
a significant portion of the claim reserves of the other operations segment relates to exposure to the insurance businesses of other insurers or reinsurers whole account exposure 
many of these whole account exposures arise from reinsurance agreements previously written by the hartford 
the hartford s net exposure in these arrangements has increased for a variety of reasons  including the hartford s commutation of previous retrocessions of such business 
due to the reporting practices of cedants to their reinsurers  determination of the nature of the individual risks involved in these whole account exposures such as asbestos  environmental  or other exposures requires various assumptions and estimates  which are subject to uncertainty  as previously discussed 
during  the company observed a decrease in newly reported environmental claims as well as favorable settlements with respect to certain existing environmental claims 
both observations were consistent with longer term positive trends for environmental liabilities 
in the same period  consistent with the reports of other insurers  the hartford experienced an increase in the number of new asbestos claims by policyholders not previously identified as potentially significant claimants  including installers or handlers of asbestos containing products 
in addition  some policyholders had begun to assert that their asbestos related claims fell within so called non products coverage contained within their policies rather than products hazard coverage and that the claimed non products coverage was not subject to any aggregate limit 
based on a review of the environmental claim trends that was completed in the fourth quarter of under the supervision of the then newly consolidated management structure and in light of the further uncertainties posed by the foregoing asbestos trends  the company reclassified of environmental reserves to asbestos reserves 
during  as part of the company s ongoing monitoring of reserves  the company reclassified of reserves from the all other reserve category  of which was reclassified to asbestos and was reclassified to environmental claim reserves 
the increase in reserves categorized as environmental of as contrasted with the decrease in the fourth quarter of occurred because the reviews in each of the two periods employed actuarial techniques to analyze distinct and non overlapping blocks of reserves and associated exposures 
facts and circumstances associated with each block determined the resulting changes in category 
a portion of the reclassification relates to re estimates of the appropriate allocation among the asbestos  environmental and all other categories of the aggregate reserves net of reinsurance carried for certain assumed reinsurance  commuted cessions and commuted retrocessions of whole account business 
as part of the reclassification  the hartford also revised formulas that it will use to allocate among the asbestos  environmental and all other categories future claim payments for which reinsurance arrangements were commuted and to allocate claim payments made to effect commutations 
as a result of these revisions  payments categorized as asbestos and environmental exposures will be higher in future periods than in prior periods 
in the first quarter of  several events occurred that in the company s view confirmed the existence of a substantial long term deterioration in the asbestos litigation environment 
for example  in february  combustion engineering  long a major asbestos defendant  filed a pre packaged bankruptcy plan under which it proposed to emerge from bankruptcy within five weeks  before opponents of the plan could have a meaningful opportunity to object  and included many novel features in its plan that its insurers found objectionable 
in december  halliburton had announced its intention to file a similar plan through one or more subsidiaries and in january  honeywell announced that it had reached an agreement with the plaintiffs bar that would enable it to file a pre negotiated plan through its former narco subsidiary  then already in bankruptcy 
in january  congoleum  a floor tile manufacturer  which previously had defended claims successfully in the tort system  announced its intention to file a pre packaged plan of reorganization to be funded almost entirely with insurance proceeds 
moreover  prominent members of the plaintiffs and policyholders bars announced publicly their intention to file many more such plans 
these events represented a worsening of conditions the company observed in as a result of these worsening conditions  the company conducted a comprehensive  ground up study of its asbestos exposures in the first quarter of in an effort to project  beginning at the individual account level  the effect of these trends on the company s estimated total exposure to asbestos liability 
based on the company s evaluation of the deteriorating conditions described above  the company strengthened its gross and net asbestos reserves by billion and billion  respectively 
the reserve strengthening related primarily to policies effective in or prior years 
the company had incorporated an absolute asbestos exclusion in most of its general liability policies written after the company believes that its current asbestos reserves are reasonable and appropriate 
however  analyses of future developments could cause the hartford to change its estimates of its asbestos and environmental reserves  and the effect of these changes could be material to the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
consistent with the company s long standing reserving practices  the hartford will continue to review and monitor these reserves regularly and  where future developments indicate  make appropriate adjustments to the reserves 
the loss reserving assumptions  drawn from both industry data and the company s experience  have been applied over time to all of this business and have resulted in reserve strengthening or reserve releases at various times over the past decade 
the following table presents reserve activity  inclusive of estimates for both reported and incurred but not reported claims  net of reinsurance  for other operations  categorized by asbestos  environmental and all other claims  for the years ended december   and also included are the remaining asbestos and environmental exposures of north american property casualty

at december   asbestos reserves were billion  an increase of billion compared to billion as of december  net incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses were billion for the year ended december  the increase in reserves as well as the increase in paid losses reflect asbestos claim and litigation trends 
on december   hartford accident and indemnity company hartford a i entered into a settlement agreement with macarthur company and its subsidiary  western macarthur company 
for further discussion of the macarthur settlement see part i  item legal proceedings 
under the settlement agreement  hartford a i will pay billion into an escrow account in the first quarter of  and the funds will be disbursed to a trust to be established for the benefit of present and future asbestos claimants pursuant to the bankruptcy plan once all conditions precedent to the settlement have occurred 
management expects that all conditions to the settlement will be satisfied  but it is not certain whether or when those conditions will be satisfied 
in comparing environmental claims and claim adjustment expenses paid from year to year  payments reflect the final settlement of a number of disputed claims that had been in the process resolution for an extended period of time 
as a result of the timing of these settlements  the company believes the level of payments in is not representative of annual payments 
trends in asbestos paids and incurreds are addressed in the paragraphs preceding the table 
all other paid losses continue to decline year to year 
the company classifies its asbestos reserves into three categories direct insurance  assumed reinsurance and london market 
direct insurance includes primary and excess coverage 
assumed reinsurance includes both treaty reinsurance covering broad categories of claims or blocks of business and facultative reinsurance covering specific risks or individual policies of primary or excess insurance companies 
london market business includes the business written by one or more of the hartford s subsidiaries in the united kingdom  which are no longer active in the insurance or reinsurance business 
such business includes both direct insurance and assumed reinsurance 
exposures on direct policies are the easiest to identify because specific policies can be associated with specific accounts and reserves established  where appropriate  for claims presented 
over the last three years  including the current reporting period  the company experienced a reduction in newly reported environmental claims on direct business  and actual claim payments have been made at levels within the company s previously established provisions for loss 
however  with respect to asbestos claims  the company experienced a variety of negative trends  including increasing numbers of policyholders making claims  an apparent increase in the number of claimants under such policies  and an accelerated rate of policyholder bankruptcies 
due to the combination of these events  the company estimates that the total value of potential claims will reach higher into the excess layers of the company s policies and into later years of coverage than had been expected 
in reporting the results of the asbestos study  the company has divided its direct asbestos exposures into the following categories major asbestos defendants the top accounts in tillinghast s published tiers and and wellington accounts collectively divided into structured settlements  wellington  and other major asbestos defendants  accounts with future expected exposures greater than  accounts with future expected exposures less than and unallocated 
structured settlements are those accounts where the company has reached an agreement with the insured as to the amount and timing of the claim payments to be made to the insured 
the wellington category includes insureds that entered into the wellington agreement dated june  the wellington agreement provided terms and conditions for how the signatory asbestos producers would access their coverage from the signatory insurers 
the other major asbestos defendants subcategory represents insureds included in tiers and  as defined by tillinghast 
the tier and classifications are meant to capture the insureds for which there is expected to be significant exposure to asbestos claims 
the unallocated category includes an estimate of the reserves necessary for asbestos claims related to direct insureds who have not previously tendered asbestos claims to the company and potential non products exposures 
assumed reinsurance exposures are inherently less predictable than direct insurance exposures because the company may not receive notice of a reinsurance claim until the underlying direct insurance claim is mature 
this causes a delay in the receipt of information at the reinsurer level reflecting changes in the asbestos tort litigation and direct insurance coverage environments 
the asbestos and environmental liability components of the london market book of business consist of both direct policies of insurance and contracts of assumed reinsurance 
as a participant in the london market comprised of both lloyd s of london and london company markets  the company wrote business on a subscription basis  with the company s involvement being limited to a relatively small percentage of a total contract placement 
claims are reported  via a broker  to the lead underwriter and  once agreed to  are presented to the following markets for concurrence 
this reporting and claim agreement process makes estimating liabilities for this business the most uncertain of the three categories of claims direct  assumed domestic and london market

survival ratio is a commonly used industry ratio for comparing reserve levels between companies 
while the method is commonly used  it is not a predictive technique 
survival ratios may vary over time due to numerous factors such as large payments due to the final resolution of certain asbestos liabilities  or reserve re estimates 
the survival ratio presented in the above table is computed by dividing the recorded reserves by the average of the past three years of payments 
the ratio is the calculated number of years the recorded reserves would survive if future annual payments were equal to the historical three year average 

the one year gross paid amount for total asbestos claims is resulting in a one year gross survival ratio of years

if the ratio was calculated without considering the billon of reserves that are allocated for the macarthur payments  which will be paid in  the one year survival ratio would be years and the three year survival ratio would be years

outlook the other operations segment will continue to manage the discontinued operations of the hartford as well as claims and associated reserves related to asbestos and environmental exposure 
the hartford will continue to review various components of all of its reserves on a periodic basis 
investments general the hartford s investment portfolios are primarily divided between life and property casualty 
the investment portfolios are managed based on the underlying characteristics and nature of each operation s respective liabilities and within established risk parameters 
for a further discussion of the hartford s approach to managing risks  see the investment credit risk and capital markets risk management sections 
the investment portfolios of life and property casualty are managed by hartford investment management company hartford investment management  a wholly owned subsidiary of the hartford 
hartford investment management is responsible for monitoring and managing the asset liability profile  establishing investment objectives and guidelines and determining  within specified risk tolerances and investment guidelines  the appropriate asset allocation  duration  convexity and other characteristics of the portfolios 
security selection and monitoring are performed by asset class specialists working within dedicated portfolio management teams 
return on general account invested assets is an important element of the hartford s financial results 
significant fluctuations in the fixed income or equity markets could weaken the company s financial condition or its results of operations 
additionally  changes in market interest rates may impact the period of time over which certain investments  such as mortgage backed securities  are repaid and whether certain investments are called by the issuers 
such changes may  in turn  impact the yield on these investments and also may result in reinvestment of funds received from calls and prepayments at rates below the average portfolio yield 
net investment income and net realized capital gains and losses accounted for approximately  and of the company s consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the company s return on  and the fair value of  general account fixed maturity investments  which comprised approximately and of the fair value of its invested assets as of december  and  respectively 
other events beyond the company s control could also adversely impact the fair value of these investments 
specifically  a downgrade of an issuer s credit rating or default of payment by an issuer could reduce the company s investment return 
the company invests in private placement securities  mortgage loans and limited partnership arrangements in order to further diversify its investment portfolio 
these investment types comprised approximately and of the fair value of its invested assets as of december  and  respectively 
these security types are typically less liquid than direct investments in publicly traded fixed income or equity investments 
however  generally these securities have higher yields to compensate for the liquidity risk 
a decrease in the fair value of any investment that is deemed other than temporary would result in the company s recognition of a net realized capital loss in its financial results prior to the actual sale of the investment 
for a further discussion  see the company s discussion of the evaluation of other than temporary impairments in critical accounting estimates under investments 
life the primary investment objective of life s general account is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity relative to that of policyholder and corporate obligations  as discussed in the capital markets risk management section under market risk life

separate account products separate account products are those for which a separate investment and liability account is maintained on behalf of the policyholder 
the company s separate accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption non guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the risk and reward  and guaranteed separate accounts totaling billion and billion as of december  and  respectively  wherein the company contractually guarantees either a minimum return or the account value to the policyholder 
guaranteed separate account products primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market value adjustment features and surrender charges to mitigate the risk of disintermediation 
the primary investment objective of guaranteed separate accounts is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of policyholder obligations  as discussed in the capital markets risk management section under market risk life

non guaranteed separate account products include variable annuities  variable universal life insurance contracts and variable coli 
the separate accounts associated with variable annuity products sold in japan do not meet the criteria to be recognized as a separate account because the assets are not legally insulated from the company 
these assets will also be included with general account assets effective january property casualty the investment objective for the majority of property casualty is to maximize economic value while generating after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder and corporate obligations

a significant number of these impairments were recorded on the company s investments in lower tranches of abs supported by aircraft lease and enhanced equipment trust certificates together  aircraft lease receivables due to continued lower aircraft lease rates and the prolonged decline in airline travel 
cdo impairments were primarily the result of increasing default rates and lower recovery rates on the collateral 
impairments on abs backed by credit card receivables were a result of issuers extending credit to sub prime borrowers and the higher default rates on these loans  while impairments on securities supported by mh receivables were primarily the result of repossessed units liquidated at depressed levels 
interest only security impairments recorded during  and were due to the flattening of the forward yield curve 
impairments of abs during and were driven by deterioration of collateral cash flows 
numerous bankruptcies  collateral defaults  weak economic conditions and reduced airline travel were all factors contributing to lower collateral cash flows and broker quoted market prices of abs 
corporate the decline in corporate bankruptcies and improvement in general economic conditions have contributed to lower corporate impairment levels in compared to a significant portion of corporate impairments during resulted from issuers who experienced fraud or accounting irregularities 
the most significant of these was the italian dairy concern  parmalat spa  and one consumer non cyclical issuer in the healthcare industry  which resulted in a and before tax loss  respectively 
a loss of was recorded relating to one communications sector issuer in the cable television industry due to deteriorating earnings forecasts  debt restructuring issues and accounting irregularities 
additional impairments were incurred as a result of the deterioration in the transportation sector during the first half of the year  specifically issuers of airline debt  as a result of a continued decline in airline travel 
during  impairments of corporate securities were concentrated in the technology and communications sector and included a before tax loss related to securities issued by worldcom

investment credit risk the hartford has established investment credit policies that focus on the credit quality of obligors and counterparties  limit credit concentrations  encourage diversification and require frequent creditworthiness reviews 
investment activity  including setting of policy and defining acceptable risk levels  is subject to regular review and approval by senior management and by the company s finance committee of the board of directors 
the company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade and has established exposure limits  diversification standards and review procedures for all credit risks including borrower  issuer and counterparty 
creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of creditworthiness  typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
obligor  asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to established limits and monitored on a regular basis 
the hartford is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer greater than of the company s stockholders equity 
derivative instruments the company s derivative counterparty exposure policy establishes market based credit limits  favors long term financial stability and creditworthiness and typically requires credit enhancement credit risk reducing agreements 
credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the company based on current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the company and its counterparties 
credit exposures are generally quantified weekly and netted  and collateral is pledged to and held by  or on behalf of  the company to the extent the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds 
the company also minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties which are reviewed periodically by the company s internal compliance unit  reviewed frequently by senior management and reported to the company s finance committee of the board of directors 
the company also maintains a policy of requiring that all derivative contracts be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement which is structured by legal entity and by counterparty and permits right of offset 
the company periodically enters into swap agreements in which the company assumes credit exposure from a single entity  referenced index or asset pool 
total return swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties  at specified intervals  calculated using the agreed upon index and notional principal amounts 
generally  no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract 
typically  at the time a swap is entered into  the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value 
credit default swaps involve a transfer of credit risk from one party to another in exchange for periodic payments 
one party to the contract will make a payment based on an agreed upon rate and a notional amount 
the second party  who assumes credit exposure  will only make a payment when there is a credit event  and such payment will be equal to the notional value of the swap contract  and in return  the second party will receive the debt obligation of the first party 
a credit event is generally defined as default on contractually obligated interest or principal payments or bankruptcy 
as of december  and  the notional value of total return and credit default swaps totaled billion and billion  respectively  and the swap fair value totaled and  respectively

the improvement in corporate credit quality was largely due to the security issuers renewed emphasis on improving liquidity  reducing leverage and various cost cutting measures 
throughout  the general economic outlook has continued to rebound  the result of improved profitability supported by improved manufacturing demand  a continued strong housing market and robust consumer and government spending 
the apparent economic acceleration has resulted in the year treasury rate increasing over basis points since december  and more than basis points from its low in june investment allocations as a percentage of total fixed maturities have remained materially consistent since december   except for cmbs  municipal tax exempt and short term securities 
portfolio allocations to cmbs increased due to the asset class s stable spreads and high quality 
cmbs securities have lower prepayment risk than mbs due to contractual penalties 
the company decreased its percentage of tax exempt municipal holdings due to alternative minimum tax implications 
short term securities have increased primarily due to the receipt of operating cash flows awaiting investment in longer term securities  securities received as part of the cna transaction and collateral obtained related to the company s securities lending program

the company s current view of risk factors relative to these fixed maturity types is as follows aircraft lease receivables the securities supported by aircraft lease receivables continued to decline in value during due to a reduction in lease payments and aircraft values driven by a prolonged decline in airline travel  which has resulted in the financial difficulties of many airline carriers 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of any potential recovery in this industry  significant risk premiums have been required by the market for these securities  resulting in reduced liquidity and lower broker quoted prices 
air travel began to improve in the second half of  which resulted in lease rates stabilizing on certain aircrafts 
while the company saw some modest price increases and greater liquidity in this sector during the fourth quarter of  additional price recovery will depend on continued improvement in economic fundamentals  political stability and airline operating performance 
cdos adverse cdo experience can be attributed to higher than expected default rates and downgrades of the collateral supporting these securities  particularly in the technology and utilities sectors  causing a deterioration in the subordinated tranches of these structures 
as a result  significant risk premiums have been required by the market for these securities  resulting in reduced liquidity and lower broker quoted prices 
improved economic and operating fundamentals of the underlying security issuers  along with better market liquidity  should lead to improved pricing levels 
credit card receivables the unrealized loss position in credit card securities has primarily been caused by exposure to companies originating loans to sub prime borrowers 
while the unrealized loss position improved for these holdings during the year due to the better than expected performance of the underlying collateral of credit card receivables  concerns remain regarding the long term viability of certain issuers within this sub sector 
as of december   security types other than abs and cmbs that were in a significant unrealized loss position for greater than six months were corporate fixed maturities primarily within the financial services sector 
financial services as of december   the securities in the financial services sector unrealized loss position for greater than six months were comprised of approximately different securities 
the securities in this category are primarily investment grade and substantially all of these securities are priced at or greater than of amortized cost as of december  these positions are primarily variable rate securities with extended maturity dates  which have been adversely impacted by the reduction in forward interest rates resulting in lower expected cash flows 
unrealized loss amounts for these securities have declined during the year as interest rates have risen 
additional changes in fair value of these securities are primarily dependent on future changes in forward interest rates 
a substantial percentage of these securities are currently hedged with interest rate swaps  which convert the variable rate earned on the securities to a fixed amount 
the swaps receive cash flow hedge accounting treatment and are currently in an unrealized gain position 
as part of the company s ongoing security monitoring process by a committee of investment and accounting professionals  the company has reviewed its investment portfolio and concluded that there were no additional other than temporary impairments as of december  and due to the issuers continued satisfaction of the securities obligations in accordance with their contractual terms and the expectation that they will continue to do so  management s intent and ability to hold these securities  as well as the evaluation of the fundamentals of the issuers financial condition and other objective evidence  the company believes that the prices of the securities in the sectors identified above were temporarily depressed 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates 
in addition  for securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows eg abs and cmbs  projections of expected future cash flows may change based upon new information regarding the performance of the underlying collateral 
as of december   management s expectation of the discounted future cash flows on these securities was in excess of the associated securities amortized cost

capital markets risk management the hartford has a disciplined approach to managing risks associated with its capital markets and asset liability management activities 
investment portfolio management is organized to focus investment management expertise on specific classes of investments  while asset liability management is the responsibility of dedicated risk management units supporting life  including guaranteed separate accounts  and property casualty operations 
derivative instruments are utilized in compliance with established company policy and regulatory requirements and are monitored internally and reviewed by senior management 
derivatives play an important role in facilitating the management of interest rate risk  mitigating equity market risk exposure associated with certain variable annuity products and changes in currency exchange rates 
market risk the company is exposed to market risk  primarily relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates  market indices or foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with the changes in market interest rates 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through asset allocation limits  asset liability duration matching and through the use of derivatives 
the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
measures the company uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are duration and key rate duration 
duration is the weighted average term to maturity of a security s cash flows  and is used to approximate the percentage change in the price of a security for a basis point change in market interest rates 
for example  a duration of means the price of the security will change by approximately for a change in interest rates 
the key rate duration analysis considers the expected future cash flows of assets and liabilities assuming non parallel interest rate movements 
to calculate duration  projections of asset and liability cash flows are discounted to a present value using interest rate assumptions 
these cash flows are then revalued at alternative interest rate levels to determine the percentage change in fair value due to an incremental change in rates 
cash flows from corporate obligations are assumed to be consistent with the contractual payment streams on a yield to worst basis 
the primary assumptions used in calculating cash flow projections include expected asset payment streams taking into account prepayment speeds  issuer call options and contract holder behavior 
asset backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities are modeled based on estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities 
these estimates are developed using prepayment speeds provided in broker consensus data 
such estimates are derived from prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral 
actual prepayment experience may vary from these estimates 
the company is also exposed to interest rate risk based upon the discount rate assumption associated with the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligation 
the discount rate assumption is based upon an interest rate yield curve comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans 
for a further discussion of interest rate risk associated with the plans  see capital resources and liquidity  pension plans and other postretirement benefits and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
equity risk the company s primary exposure to equity risk relates to the potential for lower earnings associated with certain of the life s businesses such as variable annuities where fee income is earned based upon the fair value of the assets under management 
in addition  life offers certain guaranteed benefits  primarily associated with variable annuity products  which increases the company s potential benefit exposure as the equity markets decline 
for a further discussion  see the life equity risk section 
the company does not have significant equity risk exposure from invested assets 
in march  the company decided to liquidate its hedge fund limited partnership investments and certain equity securities and reinvest the proceeds into fixed maturity investments  thereby reducing its exposure to equity price risk 
the company has not materially changed other aspects of its overall asset allocation position or market risk since december  the company is also subject to equity risk based upon the expected long term rate of return assumption associated with the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligation 
the company determines the long term rate of return assumption for the plans portfolios based upon an analysis of historical returns 
declines in equity returns have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans 
for a further discussion of equity risk associated with the plans  see capital resources and liquidity  pension plans and other postretirement benefits and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exchange risk the company s currency exchange risk is related to non us dollar denominated investments  which primarily consist of fixed maturity investments and the investment in the japanese life operation 
a significant portion of the company s foreign currency exposure is mitigated through the use of derivatives 
derivative instruments the hartford utilizes a variety of derivative instruments  including swaps  caps  floors  forwards  futures and options  in compliance with company policy and regulatory requirements to mitigate interest rate  equity market or currency exchange rate risk or volatility 
interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of payments with other parties  at specified intervals  calculated using the agreed upon rates and notional principal amounts 
generally  no cash or principal payments are exchanged at the inception of the contract 
typically  at the time a swap is entered into  the cash flow streams exchanged by the counterparties are equal in value 
interest rate cap and floor contracts entitle the purchaser to receive from the issuer at specified dates  the amount  if any  by which a specified market rate exceeds the cap strike rate or falls below the floor strike rate  applied to a notional principal amount 
a premium payment is made by the purchaser of the contract at its inception  and no principal payments are exchanged 
forward contracts are customized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments  at a future date  for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument 
financial futures are standardized commitments to either purchase or sell designated financial instruments  at a future date  for a specified price and may be settled in cash or through delivery of the underlying instrument 
futures contracts trade on organized exchanges 
margin requirements for futures are met by pledging securities  and changes in the futures contract values are settled daily in cash 
option contracts grant the purchaser  for a premium payment  the right to either purchase from or sell to the issuer a financial instrument at a specified price  within a specified period or on a stated date 
foreign currency swaps exchange an initial principal amount in two currencies  agreeing to re exchange the currencies at a future date  at an agreed upon exchange rate 
there is also periodic exchange of payments at specified intervals calculated using the agreed upon rates and exchanged principal amounts 
derivative activities are monitored by an internal compliance unit  reviewed frequently by senior management and reported to the finance committee of the board of directors 
the notional amounts of derivative contracts represent the basis upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of credit risk 
notional amounts pertaining to derivative instruments used in the management of market risk for both the general and guaranteed separate accounts at december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in the derivative notional amount during was primarily due to the embedded derivatives and reinsurance contract associated with the gmwb product feature 
the following discussions focus on the key market risk exposures within life and property casualty portfolios 
life life is responsible for maximizing after tax returns within acceptable risk parameters  including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets and the generation of sufficient liquidity to support policyholder and corporate obligations 
life s fixed maturity portfolios and certain investment contracts and insurance product liabilities have material market exposure to interest rate risk 
in addition  life s operations are significantly influenced by changes in the equity markets 
life s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management  which is primarily driven by the level of sales  equity market appreciation and depreciation and the persistency of the in force block of business 
life s foreign currency exposure is primarily related to non us dollar denominated fixed income securities and the investment in the japanese life operation 
interest rate risk life s exposure to interest rate risk relates to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact life s profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  life could be exposed to disintermediation risk and a reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margins 
the investments and liabilities primarily associated with interest rate risk are included in the following discussion 
certain product liabilities  including those containing guaranteed minimum withdrawal or death benefits  expose the company to interest rate risk but also have significant equity risk 
these liabilities are discussed as part of the equity risk section below 
fixed maturity investments life s general account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios primarily consist of investment grade fixed maturity securities  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities  tax exempt municipal securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the fair value of these investments was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of these and life s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely  during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally declines  exposing the company to the possibility of asset liability cash flow and yield mismatch 
the weighted average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was approximately and as of december  and  respectively 
liabilities life s investment contracts and certain insurance product liabilities  other than non guaranteed separate accounts  include asset accumulation vehicles such as fixed annuities  guaranteed investment contracts  other investment and universal life type contracts and other insurance products such as long term disability 
asset accumulation vehicles primarily require a fixed rate payment  often for a specified period of time 
product examples include fixed rate annuities with a market value adjustment feature and fixed rate guaranteed investment contracts 
the duration of these contracts generally range from less than one year to ten years 
in addition  certain products such as universal life contracts and the general account portion of life s variable annuity products  credit interest to policyholders subject to market conditions and minimum interest rate guarantees 
the duration of these products is short to intermediate term 
while interest rate risk associated with many of these products has been reduced through the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  the primary risk associated with these products is that the spread between investment return and credited rate may not be sufficient to earn targeted returns 
the company also manages the risk of other insurance liabilities similarly to investment type products due to the relative predictability of the aggregate cash flow payment streams 
products in this category may contain significant actuarial including mortality and morbidity pricing and cash flow risks 
product examples include structured settlement contracts  on benefit annuities ie  the annuitant is currently receiving benefits thereon and short and long term disability contracts 
the cash out flows associated with these policy liabilities are not interest rate sensitive but do vary based on the timing and amount of benefit payments 
the primary risks associated with these products are that the benefits will exceed expected actuarial pricing and or that the actual timing of the cash flows differ from those anticipated  resulting in an investment return lower than that assumed in pricing 
contract duration can range from less than one year to typically up to ten years 
product liability characteristics life s product liabilities  other than non guaranteed separate accounts  include accumulation vehicles such as fixed and variable annuities  other investment and universal life type contracts  and other insurance products such as long term disability and term life insurance 
the table below shows carrying values of insurance policy liabilities as of december  and description total total fixed rate asset accumulation vehicles weighted average credited rate indexed asset accumulation vehicles weighted average credited rate interest credited asset accumulation vehicles weighted average credited rate long term pay out liabilities short term pay out liabilities life employs several risk management tools to quantify and manage risk arising from investment contracts and other insurance liabilities  such as duration and key rate duration and the use of derivative instruments 
for certain portfolios  management monitors the changes in present value between assets and liabilities resulting from various interest rate scenarios using integrated asset liability measurement systems and a proprietary system that simulates the impacts of parallel and non parallel yield curve shifts 
based on this current and prospective information  management implements risk reducing techniques to improve the match between assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative instruments 
derivatives used to mitigate interest rate risk are discussed in more detail below 
derivatives life utilizes a variety of derivative instruments to mitigate interest rate risk 
interest rate swaps are primarily used to convert interest receipts to a fixed or variable rate 
in addition  interest rate swaps are used to convert the contract rate on certain liability products offered by the company into a rate that trades in a more liquid and efficient market 
the use of such swaps enables the company to customize contract terms and conditions to customer objectives and satisfies the operation s asset liability duration matching policy 
occasionally  swaps are also used to hedge the variability in the cash flow of a forecasted purchase or sale due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate caps and floors  swaptions and option contracts are primarily used to hedge against the risk of liability contract holder disintermediation in a rising interest rate environment  and to offset the changes in fair value of corresponding derivatives embedded in certain of the company s fixed maturity investments 
at december  and  notional amounts pertaining to derivatives utilized to manage interest rate risk totaled billion and billion  respectively billion and billion  respectively related to insurance investments and billion and billion  respectively related to life insurance liabilities 
the fair value of these derivatives as reflected on the consolidated balance sheets was and as of december  and  respectively 
calculated interest rate sensitivity the after tax change in the net economic value of investment contracts eg guaranteed investment contracts and other insurance product liabilities eg short and long term disability contracts  that are not substantially affected by changes in interest rates fixed liabilities and for which the investment experience is substantially absorbed by life  are included in the following table along with the corresponding general and guaranteed separate account assets 
also included in this analysis are the interest rate sensitive derivatives used by life to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk 
certain financial instruments  such as limited partnerships  have been omitted from the analysis because the investments are accounted for under the equity method and lack sensitivity to interest rate changes 
interest rate sensitive investment contracts and universal life type contracts are excluded from the hypothetical calculation below because the contracts generally allow life significant flexibility to adjust credited rates to reflect actual investment experience and thereby pass through a substantial portion of actual investment experience to the policyholder 
non guaranteed separate account assets and liabilities are excluded from the hypothetical calculation below because gains and losses in separate accounts generally accrue to policyholders 
the estimated change in net economic value assumes a basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve 
change in net economic value as of december  basis point shift amount the fixed liabilities included above represented approximately of life s general and guaranteed separate account liabilities as of december  and the assets supporting the fixed liabilities are monitored and managed within rigorous duration guidelines using scenario simulation techniques  and are evaluated on an annual basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
the after tax change in fair value of the general account invested asset portfolios that support interest rate sensitive investment contracts and universal life type contracts and other insurance contracts that possess significant mortality risk are shown in the following table 
the cash flows associated with these liabilities are less predictable than fixed liabilities 
the company identifies the most appropriate investment strategy based upon the expected policyholder behavior and liability crediting needs 
the hypothetical calculation of the estimated change in fair value below  assumes a basis point upward and downward parallel shift in the yield curve 
change in fair value as of december  basis point shift amount the above quantitative presentation was adopted in the current year and is in lieu of the tabular presentation historically disclosed 
the company believes the current presentation is preferable in understanding the company s invested asset interest rate risk exposure 
the selection of the basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only as a hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events 
actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis 
the company s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets and liabilities remain materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re allocations  significant product sales or non parallel changes in interest rates 
in addition  life carries other obligations non insurance liabilities that have  to a lesser extent  exposure to interest rate risk

equity risk the company s operations are significantly influenced by changes in the equity markets 
the company s profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under management  which is primarily driven by the level of sales  equity market appreciation and depreciation and the persistency of the in force block of business 
prolonged and precipitous declines in the equity markets can have a significant impact on the company s operations  as sales of variable products may decline and surrender activity may increase  as customer sentiment towards the equity market turns negative 
lower assets under management will have a negative impact on the company s financial results  primarily due to lower fee income related to the investment products and  to a lesser extent  individual life segments  where a heavy concentration of equity linked products are administered and sold 
furthermore  the company may experience a reduction in profit margins if a significant portion of the assets held in the variable annuity separate accounts move to the general account and the company is unable to earn an acceptable investment spread  particularly in light of the low interest rate environment and the presence of contractually guaranteed minimum interest credited rates  which for the most part are at a rate 
in addition  prolonged declines in the equity market may also decrease the company s expectations of future gross profits  which are utilized to determine the amount of dac to be amortized in a given financial statement period 
a significant decrease in the company s estimated gross profits would require the company to accelerate the amount of dac amortization in a given period  potentially causing a material adverse deviation in that period s net income 
although an acceleration of dac amortization would have a negative impact on the company s earnings  it would not affect the company s cash flow or liquidity position 
additionally  the investment products segment sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed death benefits 
for certain guaranteed death benefits  the company pays the greater of the account value at death  the sum of all premium payments less prior withdrawals  or the maximum anniversary value of the contract  plus any premium payments since the contract anniversary  minus any withdrawals following the contract anniversary 
the company currently reinsures a significant portion of these death benefit guarantees associated with its in force block of business 
the company currently records the death benefit costs  net of reinsurance  as they are incurred 
declines in the equity market may increase the company s net exposure to death benefits under these contracts 
the investment products segment s total gross exposure ie before reinsurance to these guaranteed death benefits as of december  is billion 
due to the fact that of this amount is reinsured  the company s net exposure is billion 
this amount is often referred to as the net amount at risk 
however  the company will incur these guaranteed death benefit payments in the future only if the policyholder has an in the money guaranteed death benefit at their time of death 
in order to analyze the total costs that the company may incur in the future related to these guaranteed death benefits  the company performed an actuarial present value analysis 
this analysis included developing a model utilizing stochastically generated scenarios and best estimate assumptions related to mortality and lapse rates 
a range of projected costs was developed and discounted back to the financial statement date utilizing the company s cost of capital  which for this purpose was assumed to be 
based on this analysis  the company estimated a confidence interval of the present value of the retained death benefit costs to be incurred in the future to be a range of to for these contracts 
the median of the stochastically generated investment performance scenarios was in addition  the company s gross and net exposure to gmdb and other benefits in its japanese operation was billion at december  on june   the company recaptured a block of business previously reinsured with an unaffiliated reinsurer 
under this treaty  life reinsured a portion of the gmdb feature associated with certain of its annuity contracts 
as consideration for recapturing the business and final settlement under the treaty  the company has received assets valued at approximately and one million warrants exercisable for the unaffiliated company s stock 
prospectively  as a result of the recapture  life will be responsible for all of the remaining and ongoing risks associated with the gmdb s related to this block of business 
the recapture increased the net amount at risk retained by the company  which is included in the net amount at risk discussed above 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts  the sop 
the provisions of the sop include a requirement for recording a liability for variable annuity products with a guaranteed minimum death benefit feature 
the determination of this liability is also based on models that involve numerous estimates and subjective judgments  including those regarding expected market rates of return and volatility  contract surrender rates and mortality experience 
as of january   the company has recorded a liability for gmdb s sold with variable annuity products of and a related reinsurance recoverable asset of net of estimated dac and income tax effects  the cumulative effect of establishing the required gmdb reserves resulted in a reduction of net income of during the first quarter of in addition  the company offers certain variable annuity products with a gmwb rider 
the gmwb provides the policyholder with a guaranteed remaining balance grb if the account value is reduced to zero through a combination of market declines and withdrawals 
the grb is generally equal to premiums less withdrawals 
however  annual withdrawals that exceed of the premiums paid may reduce the grb by an amount greater than the withdrawals and may also impact the guaranteed annual withdrawal amount that subsequently applies after the excess annual withdrawals occur 
the policyholder also has the option  after a specified time period  to reset the grb to the then current account value  if greater 
the gmwb represents an embedded derivative liability in the variable annuity contract that is required to be reported separately from the host variable annuity contract 
it is carried at fair value and reported in other policyholder funds 
the fair value of the gmwb obligations are calculated based on actuarial assumptions related to the projected cash flows  including benefits and related contract charges  over the lives of the contracts  incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
because of the dynamic and complex nature of these cash flows  stochastic techniques under a variety of market return scenarios and other best estimate assumptions are used 
estimating cash flows involves numerous estimates and subjective judgments including those regarding expected market rates of return  market volatility  correlations of market returns and discount rates 
declines in the equity market may increase the company s exposure to benefits under the gmwb contracts 
for all contracts in effect through july   the company entered into a reinsurance arrangement to offset its exposure to the gmwb for the remaining lives of those contracts 
as of july   the company exhausted all but a small portion of the reinsurance capacity for new business under the current arrangement and will be ceding only a very small number of new contracts subsequent to july  substantially all new contracts with the gmwb are not covered by reinsurance 
these unreinsured contracts are expected to generate volatility in net income as the underlying embedded derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value each reporting period  resulting in the recognition of net realized capital gains or losses in response to changes in certain critical factors including capital market conditions and policyholder behavior 
in order to minimize the volatility associated with the unreinsured gmwb liabilities  the company established an alternative risk management strategy 
during the third quarter of  the company began hedging its unreinsured gmwb exposure using interest rate futures  standard and poor s s p and nasdaq index put options and futures contracts 
the net impact of the change in value of the embedded derivative  net of the results of the hedging program was a pre tax gain for the year ended december  the net gain is due principally to an approximate gain associated with international funds for which hedge positions had not been initiated prior to december  but were initiated in the first quarter of and due to modeling refinements to improve valuation estimates 
excluding these items  ineffectiveness on s p and nasdaq economic hedge positions was not significant 
currency exchange risk currency exchange risk exists with respect to investments in non us dollar denominated fixed maturities  primarily denominated in euro  sterling  yen and canadian dollars  as well as life s investment in foreign operations  primarily japan 
the functional currency of the japanese operation is the japanese yen 
accordingly  the premiums  claims  commissions and investment income are paid or received in yen 
in addition  most of the japanese operation s investments are yen denominated 
the risk associated with these investments relates to potential decreases in value and income resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates 
at december  and  life had approximately billion and billion of non us dollar denominated fixed maturities  respectively 
the net investment in the japanese operation was approximately and  as of december  and  respectively 
in order to manage its currency exposures  life enters into foreign currency swaps to hedge the variability in cash flow associated with certain foreign denominated fixed maturities 
these foreign currency swap agreements are structured to match the foreign currency cash flows of the hedged foreign denominated securities 
as of december   substantially all the fixed maturity investments were hedged into us dollars mitigating the foreign currency exchange risk 
in addition  during  life entered into yen denominated forwards to hedge a substantial portion of the net investment in the japanese operation 
at december  and  the derivatives used to hedge currency exchange risk had a total notional value of billion and billion  respectively  and total fair value of and  respectively 
based on the fair values of life s non us dollar denominated investments and derivative instruments including its japanese operation as of december  and  management estimates that a unfavorable change in exchange rates would decrease the fair values by a total of and  respectively 
the estimated impact was based upon a change in december spot rates 
the selection of the unfavorable change was made only for hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events 
actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis 
property casualty property casualty attempts to maximize economic value while generating appropriate after tax income and sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder and corporate obligations 
property casualty s portfolio has material exposure to interest rates 
the company continually monitors these exposures and makes portfolio adjustments to manage these risks within established limits 
interest rate risk the primary exposure to interest rate risk in property casualty relates to its fixed maturity investments  including corporate bonds  asset backed securities  municipal bonds  commercial mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
the fair value of these investments was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of these and property casualty s other invested assets fluctuates depending on the interest rate environment and other general economic conditions 
during periods of declining interest rates  embedded call features within securities are exercised with greater frequency and paydowns on mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations increase as the underlying mortgages are prepaid 
during such periods  the company generally will not be able to reinvest the proceeds of any such prepayments at comparable yields 
conversely during periods of rising interest rates  the rate of prepayments generally decline 
derivative instruments such as swaps  caps and options are used to manage interest rate risk and had a total notional amount as of december  and of billion and billion  respectively  and fair value of and  respectively 
one of the measures property casualty uses to quantify its exposure to interest rate risk inherent in its invested assets is duration 
the weighted average duration of the fixed maturity portfolio was as of december  and calculated interest rate sensitivity the following table provides an analysis showing the estimated after tax change in the fair value of property casualty s fixed maturity investments and related derivatives  assuming basis point upward and downward parallel shifts in the yield curve as of december  and certain financial instruments  such as limited partnerships  have been omitted from the analysis due to the fact the investments are accounted for under the equity method and lack sensitivity to interest rate changes 
change in fair value basis point shift amount the above quantitative presentation was adopted in the current year and is in lieu of the tabular presentation used by the company in previous years 
the company believes the current presentation is preferable in understanding the company s exposure to interest rate risk and how such exposure is managed 
the selection of the basis point parallel shift in the yield curve was made only for hypothetical illustration of the potential impact of such an event and should not be construed as a prediction of future market events 
actual results could differ materially from those illustrated above due to the nature of the estimates and assumptions used in the above analysis 
the company s sensitivity analysis calculation assumes that the composition of invested assets remains materially consistent throughout the year and that the current relationship between short term and long term interest rates will remain constant over time 
as a result  these calculations may not fully capture the impact of portfolio re allocations or non parallel changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk also exists  to a lesser extent  on debt issued

currency exchange risk currency exchange risk exists with respect to investments in non us dollar denominated fixed maturities  primarily euro  sterling and canadian dollar denominated securities 
the risk associated with these securities relates to potential decreases in value resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates 
the fair value of these fixed maturity securities at december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
in order to manage its currency exposures  property casualty enters into foreign currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the variability in cash flow associated with certain foreign denominated securities 
these foreign currency swap agreements are structured to match the foreign currency cash flows of the hedged foreign denominated securities 
at december  and  the derivatives used to hedge currency exchange risk had a total notional value of and  respectively  and total fair value of and  respectively

of short term debt was repaid in january capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent the overall financial strength of the hartford and its ability to generate strong cash flows from each of the business segments  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
liquidity requirements the liquidity requirements of the hartford have been and will continue to be met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper  common stock  debt securities and borrowings from its credit facilities 
the principal sources of operating funds are premiums and investment income  while investing cash flows originate from maturities and sales of invested assets 
the hartford endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its insurance subsidiaries  ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace see the ratings section below for further discussion  and strong shareholder returns 
as a result  the company may from time to time raise capital from the issuance of stock  debt or other capital securities 
the issuance of common stock  debt or other capital securities could result in the dilution of shareholder interests or reduced net income due to additional interest expense 
the hartford financial services group  inc hfsg and hli are holding companies which rely upon operating cash flow in the form of dividends from their subsidiaries  which enable them to service debt  pay dividends  and pay certain business expenses 
dividends to hfsg from its subsidiaries are restricted 
the payment of dividends by connecticut domiciled insurers is limited under the insurance holding company laws of connecticut 
under these laws  the insurance subsidiaries may only make their dividend payments out of unassigned surplus 
these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend  which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of i of the insurer s policyholder surplus as of december of the preceding year or ii net income or net gain from operations  if such company is a life insurance company for the twelve month period ending on the thirty first day of december last preceding  in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting policies 
in addition  if any dividend of a connecticut domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer s earned surplus  it requires the prior approval of the connecticut insurance commissioner 
the insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which the hartford s insurance subsidiaries are incorporated or deemed commercially domiciled generally contain similar although in certain instances somewhat more restrictive limitations on the payment of dividends 
for the year ended december   the company s insurance subsidiaries paid to hfsg and hli and are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately billion in dividends to hfsg and hli in without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner 
the primary uses of funds are to pay claims  policy benefits  operating expenses and commissions and to purchase new investments 
in addition  the hartford has a policy of carrying a significant short term investment position and accordingly does not anticipate selling intermediate and long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs

sources of liquidity shelf registrations on december   the hartford s shelf registration statement registration no 
for the potential offering and sale of debt and equity securities in an aggregate amount of up to billion was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
the registration statement allows for the following types of securities to be offered i debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  depositary shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units and junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of the company  and ii preferred securities of any of one or more capital trusts organized by the hartford the hartford trusts

the lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
at the end of the initial lease term  the company has the option to purchase the leased assets  renew the lease for two one year periods or return the leased assets to the lessor 
if the company elects to return the assets to the lessor at the end of the initial lease term  the assets will be sold  and the company has guaranteed a residual value on the furniture and fixtures of if the fair value of the furniture and fixtures were to decline below the residual value  the company would have to make up the difference under the residual value guarantee 
since the estimated fair value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term exceeds the residual value  the company has not recorded a liability for the residual value guarantee 
the company has outstanding commitments to fund limited partnership investments 
these capital commitments can be called by the partnership at any time during the commitment period on average  years to fund working capital needs or the purchase of new investments 
if the commitment period expires and has not been fully funded  the hartford is not required to fund the remaining unfunded commitment but may elect to do so 
the company is unable to predict the timing of the funding of these outstanding commitments 
the company also has outstanding commitments to fund obligations associated with investments in mortgage loans 
these have a commitment period that expires in one year

includes estimated contribution of to the company s pension plan in pension plans and other postretirement benefits the company maintains a us qualified defined benefit pension plan the plan that covers substantially all employees  as well as unfunded excess plans to provide benefits in excess of amounts permitted to be paid to participants of the plan under the provisions of the internal revenue code 
additionally  the company has entered into individual retirement agreements with certain current and retired directors providing for unfunded supplemental pension benefits 
the company maintains international plans which represent an immaterial percentage of total pension assets  liabilities and expense and  for reporting purposes  are combined with domestic plans 
in september  the company announced its approval to amend the plan to implement  effective january   the cash balance formula for purposes of calculating future pension benefits for services rendered on or after january  for employees hired before january  these amounts are in addition to amounts earned through december  under the traditional final average pay formula 
employees hired on or after january  are currently covered under the same cash balance formula 
the company made voluntary contributions of  and in  and  respectively  to its defined benefit pension plan 
pension expense reflected in the company s net income was  and in  and  respectively 
the company estimates its pension expense will be approximately  based on current assumptions provided below 
the assumptions that primarily impact the amount of the company s pension obligations and periodic pension expense are the weighted average discount rate and the plan asset portfolio s expected long term rate of return 
in determining the discount rate assumption  the company utilizes current market information provided by its plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of the company s pension obligation and general movements in the current market environment 
in particular  the company uses an interest rate yield curve developed by its plan actuaries to make judgments pursuant to eitf topic no 
d  selection of discount rates used for measuring defined benefit pension obligations and obligations of postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the yield curve is comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
based upon all available information  it was determined that is the appropriate discount rate as of december  to calculate the company s accrued benefit cost liability 
accordingly  as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the discount rate will also be used to determine the company s pension expense 
at december  the discount rate was 
the company determines the long term rate of return assumption for the plan s asset portfolio based on analysis of the portfolio s historical compound rates of return since the earliest date for which comparable portfolio data is available over rolling year  year and year periods  balanced along with future long term return expectations 
the company selected these periods  as well as shorter durations  to assess the portfolio s volatility  duration and total returns as they relate to pension obligation characteristics  which are influenced by the company s workforce demographics 
while the historical return of the plan s portfolio has been since  management lowered its long term rate of return assumption from to as of december  based on its long term outlook with respect to the markets  which has been influenced by the poor equity market performance in recent years coupled with the recent decline in fixed income security yields 
the plan s asset portfolio is generally structured over time to include approximately equity securities substantially securities issued by united states based companies and fixed income securities substantially investment grade and above 
at december   the portfolio composition varied slightly from the targeted mix and was approximately equity securities and fixed income securities due in part to a rebound in the equity markets and declining interest rates 
as provided for under sfas no 
 the company uses a five year averaging method to determine the market related value of plan assets  which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense 
under this methodology  asset gains losses that result from returns that differ from the company s long term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market related value of assets on a level basis over a five year period 
the actual asset return loss for the plan of and for the years ended december  and  respectively  reflects the improved equity market performance in  as compared to an expected return of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these differentials will be fully reflected in the market related value of plan assets over the next five years using the methodology described above 
despite the favorable actual asset return  the level of unrecognized net losses continues to exceed the allowable amortization corridor as defined under sfas no 
based on the selected discount rate of and taking into account estimated future minimum funding  the differential between actual and expected performance in will decrease annual pension expense in future years by approximately in and decrease by approximately in additionally  the decrease in the long term rate of return assumption from to is expected to increase the company s annual pension expense by approximately at december   the change in the discount rate from as of december  to as of december  increased the projected benefit obligation pbo by the effect of this increase in pbo will serve to increase annual pension expense by approximately  assuming no future changes in discount rates going forward 
in addition  the decrease in discount rate will also increase the service cost component of pension expense by approximately changes in the economic assumptions used to determine pension expense will impact the company s pension expense 
as mentioned earlier  the two economic assumptions that have the most impact on pension expense are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
to illustrate the impact of these assumptions on annual pension expense for and going forward  a basis point change in the discount rate will increase decrease pension expense by approximately  and a basis point change in the long term asset return assumption will increase decrease pension expense by approximately while the company has significant discretion in making voluntary contributions to the plan  the employee retirement income security act of regulations mandate minimum contributions in certain circumstances 
under current assumptions  assuming no continued pension relief in the required minimum funding contributions are estimated to be approximately if congress approves pension relief legislation for  the company is not expected to have a minimum funding requirement in capitalization the capital structure of the hartford as of december  and consisted of debt and equity  summarized as follows as of december  short term debt includes current maturities of long term debt  long term debt

includes junior subordinated debentures 
the hartford s total capitalization increased billion during the year ended and as of december  as compared with december  this increase was due to the capital raising described below  partially offset by dividends declared and the loss for the year  which reflected the billion  after tax  charge taken to strengthen reserves for asbestos related exposure

subsequent events on january   the hartford issued approximately million shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of per share and received net proceeds of subsequently  on january   the hartford issued approximately  shares of common stock pursuant to an underwritten offering at a price to the public of per share and received net proceeds of the company used the proceeds from these issuances to repay of commercial paper issued in connection with the acquisition of the group life and accident  and short term and long term disability business of cna financial corporation 
dividends on october   the hartford declared a dividend on its common stock of per share payable on january  to shareholders of record as of december  the hartford declared and paid in dividends to shareholders in  declared and paid in and declared and paid in aoci aoci increased by as of december  compared with december  the increase resulted primarily from the impact of decreased interest rates on unrealized gains on the fixed maturity portfolio  partially offset by net losses on cash flow hedging instruments 
the funded status of the company s pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
declines in the value of securities traded in equity markets coupled with declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans 
as a result  the company recorded a minimum pension liability as of december   and  which resulted in an after tax reduction of stockholders equity of and respectively 
this minimum pension liability did not affect the company s results of operations

cash flow net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used for investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    cash end of year compared to the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of the asbestos reserve addition  partially offset by the related income statement effects of this addition and increases in reinsurance recoverables 
financing activities increased primarily due to capital raising activities related to the asbestos reserve addition and decreased due to repayments on long term debt and lower proceeds from investment and universal life type contracts 
the increase in cash from financing activities accounted for the majority of the change in cash used for investing activities 
compared to the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of higher net income reported for the year ended december  than for the prior year as well as an increase in income tax refunds received in compared with the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of increased proceeds from investment and universal life type contracts  partially offset by lower proceeds received from issuances of common stock and no issuances of junior subordinated debentures in the increase in cash from financing activities accounted for the majority of the change in cash for investing activities 
operating cash flows in each of the last three years have been adequate to meet liquidity requirements 
acquisitions cna on december   the company acquired cna financial corporation s group life and accident  and short term and long term disability businesses for in cash 
purchase consideration for this transaction was obtained from the issuance of commercial paper 
the purchase price paid on december   was based on a september  valuation of the business acquired 
during the first quarter of  the purchase price will be adjusted to reflect a december  valuation of the business acquired

the agencies consider many factors in determining the final rating of an insurance company 
one consideration is the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business written 
statutory surplus represents the capital of the insurance company reported in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the applicable state insurance department 
the table below sets forth statutory surplus for the company s insurance companies 
life operations   property casualty operations   total   risk based capital the national association of insurance commissioners naic has regulations establishing minimum capitalization requirements based on risk based capital rbc formulas for both life and property and casualty companies 
the requirements consist of formulas  which identify companies that are undercapitalized and require specific regulatory actions 
the rbc formula for life companies establishes capital requirements relating to insurance  business  asset and interest rate risks 
rbc is calculated for property and casualty companies after adjusting capital for certain underwriting  asset  credit and off balance sheet risks 
as of december   each of the hartford s insurance subsidiaries within life and north american property casualty had more than sufficient capital to meet the naic s minimum rbc requirements 
terrorism risk insurance act of the terrorism risk insurance act of the act established a program that will run through that provides a backstop for insurance related losses resulting from any act of terrorism certified by the secretary of the treasury  in concurrence with the secretary of state and attorney general 
under the program  the federal government will pay of covered losses after an insurer s losses exceed a deductible determined by a statutorily prescribed formula  up to a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion 
if an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers with losses exceeding their deductibles will not be responsible for additional losses 
the statutory formula for determining a company s deductible for each year is based on the company s direct commercial earned premiums for the prior calendar year multiplied by a specified percentage 
the specified percentages are for and for the act applies to a significant portion of the hartford s commercial property and casualty contracts  but it specifically excludes some of the hartford s other insurance business  including crop or livestock insurance  reinsurance and personal lines business 
the act currently does not apply to group life insurance contracts but permits the secretary of the treasury to extend the backstop protection to them 
on august   the treasury department announced that it would not use its legislatively granted authority to include group life insurance under the federal backstop for terrorism losses in the terrorism risk insurance act of in announcing this decision  the treasury stated that they would continue to monitor the group life situation 
the act requires all property and casualty insurers  including the hartford  to make terrorism insurance coverage available in all of their covered commercial property and casualty insurance policies as defined in the act 
the hartford will evaluate risks with terrorism exposures by applying its internally developed underwriting guidelines and control plans 
the hartford does not anticipate significant increases in premiums due to the act 
in the event the act is not renewed  or is renewed in a materially different form  the company may have to attempt to obtain appropriate reinsurance for the related terrorism risk  seek exclusions from coverage related to terrorism exposure from the appropriate regulatory authorities  limit certain of its writings  or pursue a solution encompassing aspects of one or all of the foregoing 
contingencies legal proceedings the hartford is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  both as a liability insurer defending third party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it 
the hartford accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid claim and claim adjustment expense reserves 
subject to the discussion of the litigation involving macarthur in part i  item legal proceedings and the uncertainties related to asbestos and environmental claims discussed in the md a under the caption other operations  management expects that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such ordinary course claims litigation  after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense  will not be material to the consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the hartford 
the hartford is also involved in other kinds of legal actions  some of which assert claims for substantial amounts 
these actions include  among others  putative state and federal class actions seeking certification of a state or national class 
such putative class actions have alleged  for example  underpayment of claims or improper underwriting practices in connection with various kinds of insurance policies  such as personal and commercial automobile  premises liability and inland marine  and improper sales practices in connection with the sale of life insurance and other investment products 
the hartford also is involved in individual actions in which punitive damages are sought  such as claims alleging bad faith in the handling of insurance claims 
management expects that the ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such lawsuits  after consideration of provisions made for potential losses and costs of defense  will not be material to the consolidated financial condition of the hartford 
nonetheless  given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these actions  and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
dependence on certain third party relationships the company distributes its annuity  life and certain property and casualty insurance products through a variety of distribution channels  including broker dealers  banks  wholesalers  its own internal sales force and other third party organizations 
the company periodically negotiates provisions and renewals of these relationships and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to the company or such third parties 
an interruption in the company s continuing relationship with certain of these third parties could materially affect the company s ability to market its products 
for further information on other contingencies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
legislative initiatives on july   the senate judiciary committee approved legislation that  if enacted  would provide for the creation of a federal asbestos trust fund in place of the current tort system for determining asbestos liabilities 
the prospects for enactment and the ultimate details of any legislation creating a federal asbestos trust fund are uncertain 
therefore  any potential effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
certain elements of the jobs and growth tax relief reconciliation act of  in particular the reduction in tax rates on long term capital gains and most dividend distributions  could have a material effect on the company s sales of variable annuities and other investment products 
while sales of these products do not appear to have been reduced to date  the long term effect of the jobs and growth act of on the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
there are proposals in the federal budget submitted by president bush which would create new investment vehicles with larger annual contribution limits for individuals 
some of these proposed vehicles would have significant tax advantages  and could have a material effect on sales of the company s life insurance and investment products 
there also have been proposals regarding the estate tax and deferred compensation arrangements that could have negative effects on the company s product sales 
prospects for enactment of this legislation in are uncertain 
therefore  any potential effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
in addition  other tax proposals and regulatory initiatives which have been or are being considered by congress could have a material effect on the insurance business 
these proposals and initiatives include changes pertaining to the tax treatment of insurance companies and life insurance products and annuities  and reductions in benefits currently received by the company stemming from the dividends received deduction 
legislation to restructure the social security system and expand private pension plans incentives also may be considered 
prospects for enactment and the ultimate effect of these proposals are uncertain 
congress is expected to consider provisions regarding age discrimination in defined benefit plans  transition relief for older and longer service workers affected by changes to traditional defined benefit pension plans and the replacement of the interest rate used to determine pension plan funding requirements 
these changes could affect the company s pension plan 
congress may consider a number of legal reform proposals this year 
among them is legislation that would reduce the number and type of national class actions certified by state judges by updating the federal rules on diversity jurisdiction 
prospects for enactment of these proposals in are uncertain 
insolvency fund in all states  insurers licensed to transact certain classes of insurance are required to become members of an insolvency fund 
in most states  in the event of the insolvency of an insurer writing any such class of insurance in the state  members of the fund are assessed to pay certain claims of the insolvent insurer 
a particular state s fund assesses its members based on their respective written premiums in the state for the classes of insurance in which the insolvent insurer is engaged 
assessments are generally limited for any year to one or two percent of premiums written per year depending on the state 
such assessments paid by the hartford approximated in  in and in effect of inflation the rate of inflation as measured by the change in the average consumer price index has not had a material effect on the revenues or operating results of the hartford during the three most recent fiscal years 
impact of new accounting standards for a discussion of accounting standards  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in july  the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts the sop 
the sop addresses a wide variety of topics  some of which have a significant impact on the company 
the major provisions of the sop require recognizing expenses for a variety of contracts and contract features  including guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdb  certain death benefits on universal life type contracts and annuitization options  on an accrual basis versus the previous method of recognition upon payment  reporting and measuring assets and liabilities of certain separate account products as general account assets and liabilities when specified criteria are not met  reporting and measuring the company s interest in its separate accounts as general account assets based on the insurer s proportionate beneficial interest in the separate account s underlying assets  and capitalizing sales inducements that meet specified criteria and amortizing such amounts over the life of the contracts using the same methodology as used for amortizing deferred acquisition costs dac 
the sop is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  at the date of initial application  january   the estimated cumulative effect of the adoption of the sop on net income and other comprehensive income was comprised of the following individual impacts cumulative effect of adoption net income other comprehensive income establishing gmdb and other benefit reserves for annuity contracts reclassifying certain separate accounts to general accounts other total cumulative effect of adoption exclusive of the cumulative effect  overall application of the sop is expected to have a small positive impact to earnings over the next few years  with individual impacts described below 
death benefits and other insurance benefit features the company sells variable annuity contracts that offer various guaranteed death benefits 
for certain guaranteed death benefits  life pays the greater of the account value at death  the sum of all premium payments less prior withdrawals  or the maximum anniversary value of the contract  plus any premium payments since the contract anniversary  minus any withdrawals following the contract anniversary 
the company currently reinsures a significant portion of these death benefit guarantees associated with its in force block of business 
as of january   the company has recorded a liability for gmdb and other benefits sold with variable annuity products of and a related reinsurance recoverable asset of the determination of the gmdb liability and related reinsurance recoverable is based on models that involve a range of scenarios and assumptions  including those regarding expected market rates of return and volatility  contract surrender rates and mortality experience 
the assumptions used are consistent with those used in determining estimated gross profits for purposes of amortizing deferred acquisition costs 
exclusive of the cumulative effect adjustment  the establishment of the required liability at january  is expected to result in slightly higher earnings in future years as well as a more stable pattern of death benefit expense 
the company sells universal life type contracts with certain secondary guarantees  such as a guarantee that the policy will not lapse  even if the account value is reduced to zero  as long as the policyholder makes scheduled premium payments 
the assumptions used in the determination of the secondary guarantee liability are consistent with those used in determining estimated gross profits for purposes of amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs 
based on current estimates  the company expects the cumulative effect on net income upon recording this liability to be not material 
the establishment of the required liability will change the earnings pattern of these products  lowering earnings in the early years of the contract and increasing earnings in the later years 
based on the current in force of these products  the impact is not expected to be material in the near term 
currently there is diversity in industry practice and inconsistent guidance surrounding the application of the sop to universal life type contracts 
the company believes consensus or further guidance surrounding the methodology for determining reserves for secondary guarantees will develop in the future 
this may result in an adjustment to the cumulative effect of adopting the sop and could impact future earnings 
separate account presentation the company has recorded certain market value adjusted mva fixed annuity and modified guarantee life insurance products primarily the company s compound rate contract crc and associated assets as separate account assets and liabilities through december  notwithstanding the market value adjustment feature in this product  all of the investment performance of the separate account assets is not being passed to the contractholder  and it therefore  does not meet the conditions for separate account reporting under the sop 
on january   the cumulative adjustments to earnings and other comprehensive income as a result of recording the separate account assets and liabilities in the general account were recorded net of amortization of deferred acquisition costs and income taxes 
through december   the company had recorded crc assets and liabilities on a market value basis with all changes in value market value spread included in current earnings as a component of other revenues 
upon adoption of the sop  the component of crc spread on a book value basis will be recorded in net investment income and interest credited 
realized gains and losses on investments and market value adjustments on contract surrenders will be recognized as incurred 
on balance  exclusive of the cumulative effect gain recognized  these changes will result in smaller future earnings from the in force block of crc contracts 
the company has also recorded its variable annuity products offered in japan in separate account assets and liabilities through december  as the separate account arrangement in japan is not legally insulated from the general account liabilities of the company  it does not meet the conditions for separate account reporting under the sop 
the adoption of the sop will not change the pattern of earnings in the future 
certain other products offered by the company recorded in separate account assets and liabilities through december   were reclassified to the general account upon adoption of the sop 
interests in separate accounts as of december   the company had representing unconsolidated interests in its own separate accounts 
on january   the company reclassified to investment in trading securities  where the company s proportionate beneficial interest in the separate account was less than 
in instances where the company s proportionate beneficial interest was between  the company reclassified of its investment to reflect the company s proportionate interest in each of the underlying assets of the separate account 
future impacts to net income as a result of adopting these provisions of the sop will be insignificant 
sales inducements the company currently offers enhanced or bonus crediting rates to contract holders on certain of its individual and group annuity products 
effective january   upon adopting the sop  the future expense associated with offering a bonus will be deferred and amortized over the life of the related contract in a pattern consistent with the amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
effective january   amortization expense associated with expenses previously deferred will be recorded over the remaining life of the contract rather than over the contingent deferred sales charge period 
due to the longer deferral periods  this provision is expected to have a small positive impact to earnings in future periods
