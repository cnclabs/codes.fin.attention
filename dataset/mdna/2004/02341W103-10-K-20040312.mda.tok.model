item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a global  specialty minerals company and earn our revenues and profits from the sale of products and services that serve over product markets 
our minerals segment operates manufacturing facilities in six countries and has three business units metalcasting  pet products and specialty minerals 
our environmental segment operates seven manufacturing facilities in six countries and has three business units lining technologies  building materials and water treatment 
additionally  we have a transportation segment that performs trucking services for the minerals and environmental segments as well as unrelated parties and a developing nanocomposite business that is reported within our corporate segment 
the principal mineral that we utilize to generate revenues is bentonite 
we own or lease bentonite reserves in the united states and china 
additionally  through our joint ventures and minority interests  we have access to bentonite reserves in egypt  india and mexico 
bentonite deposits have varying physical properties which require us to characterize which markets our reserves can serve 
we believe that our understanding of bentonite properties  mining methods  processing and application to markets are the core components of the longevity of our company and our future prospects 
our customer base is diverse in regard to their end markets and geography 
they range from foundries that produce castings for automotive and transportation products heavy duty trucks and railroad cars to producers of consumer goods cat box filler  cosmetics and detergents 
a majority of our products have been used in the same applications for decades and have experienced minimal technological obsolescence 
a majority of our business is performed under short term agreements  therefore  terms of sale  such as pricing and volume  can change within our fiscal year 
approximately two thirds of our revenue is generated in north america  consequently  the state of the us economy impacts our revenues 
our fastest growing markets are in central europe and asia  which have continued to outpace the us in economic growth 
the weakening of the us dollar has been a benefit to our revenues and profits over the past year  however our operating results may be affected in the future by the change in the euro and british pound compared to the us dollar 
sustainable  long term profit growth is our primary objective 
we are undertaking a number of strategic initiatives to achieve this goal o organic growth the central component of our growth strategy is expansion of our product lines and market presence 
we have had a history of commitment to research and development and using this resource to bring innovative products to market 
we believe this approach to growth offers the best probability of achieving our long term goals at the lowest risk 
o globalization we have expanded our manufacturing and marketing organizations into europe and asia pacific over the last years 
this operating experience enables us to expand further into emerging markets 
we see china and india as significant opportunities for expanding our revenues and earnings over the long term as a number of markets we serve  such as metalcasting and lining technologies  are expected to grow 
o mineral development bentonite is a component in over of the products we produce 
since it is a natural material  we must continually expand our reserve base to maintain a long term business 
our goal is to add new reserves to replace the bentonite mined each year 
furthermore  we need to assure new reserves meet the physical property requirements for our diverse product lines and are economical to mine 
our organization that is committed to developing its global reserve base to meet these requirements 
o acquisitions we continually seek opportunities to add complementary businesses to our portfolio of products 
over the last two years  we have acquired five businesses for a total cost of approximately million 
a strong financial position will enable us to continue to acquire businesses which  in our assessment  are valued fairly and fit with our growth strategy 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in implementing any one or more of the strategic initiatives described above 
a number of risks will challenge us in meeting our long term objectives 
we describe certain risks  such as competition and our reliance on economically sensitive markets  under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
in general  the significance of these risks has not changed over the past year 
one particular situation  however  does present a challenge to manage in the near term 
bulk cargo shipping costs are rising significantly due to acute demand from china 
we rely on shipping bulk cargos of bentonite from the us and china to customers  as wells as our own subsidiaries 
this issue is not isolated to amcol  however  we may need to offset additional shipping costs with price increases to customers in order to maintain our profitability 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving these price increases 
we are also reviewing our shipping patterns to determine more cost effective means of transporting bulk cargos 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations describes relevant aspects of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to select accounting policies that are appropriate for our business  and to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain in applying those policies 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our management has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which the financial statements are based and that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments 
these policies relate to the valuation of accounts receivable and inventories  the recognition of depreciation and impairment in the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  and accounting for pension benefits 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the members of the audit committee of our board of directors 
these accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion which follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
valuation of accounts receivable we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations 
our customer base is diverse and includes customers located throughout the world 
payment terms in certain of the foreign countries in which we do business are longer than those that are customary in the united states  and as a result  may give rise to additional credit risk related to outstanding accounts receivable from these non us customers 
likewise  a change in the financial position  liquidity or prospects of any of our customers could have an impact on our ability to collect amounts due 
while concentrations of credit risk related to trade receivables are somewhat limited by our large customer base  we do extend significant credit to some of our customers 
we make estimates of the amounts of our gross accounts receivable that will not be collectible  and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of accounts receivable to the amount that is expected to be realized 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established based upon the company s historical bad debt experience  a review of the overall aging of the accounts  and an analysis of specific customer accounts  particularly those with past due balances 
the recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to cover specific customer collection issues identified by management at the balance sheet date  and to provide for potential losses from other accounts based on our historical experience 
increases in the allowance for doubtful accounts are recorded as an expense and included in general  selling and administrative expenses in the period identified 
our estimate of the required allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future collectibility of customer accounts 
inventory valuation inventories are recorded at the lower of actual manufactured or purchased cost  or estimated net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and evaluates significant items to determine whether they are excess or obsolete 
we record the value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense which is included in cost of sales in the period it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  management prepares lists of inventory quantities on hand and determines the amount of such inventories that  based on projected demand  are not anticipated to be sold within the next to months or  based on our current product offerings  are excess or obsolete 
this list is then reviewed with sales and production management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory is complete 
factors which impact this evaluation include  for example  whether there has been a change in the market or packaging for particular products  and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete formulations or technology 
in certain businesses in which we are engaged  such as the domestic cat litter business  product and packaging changes can occur rapidly and expose us to excess and obsolete inventories 
goodwill and long lived assets we have made substantial investments in property  plant and equipment and have a moderate investment in goodwill 
for property  plant and equipment  we evaluate the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
for goodwill  we perform an annual impairment assessment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in analyzing the fair value of goodwill and assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  management uses models which are based on estimates of future operating performance and related cash flows 
in preparing these models  management must make estimates in projecting future cash flows attributable to the reporting unit or assets being tested  in selecting a discount rate that reflects the related business risks  and in determining the appropriate perpetuity or disposal value 
in developing these projections of future cash flows  we make a variety of important assumptions and estimates that have a significant impact on management s assessments of whether the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment should be adjusted to reflect impairment 
among these are assumptions and estimates about the future growth and profitability of the related business unit or asset  and assumptions about anticipated future economic  regulatory and political conditions in the relevant market 
our estimates related to the carrying values of goodwill and property  plant and equipment are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
for example  judgment is required to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  in performing assessments of the carrying values of these assets  we must make judgments about the future business  economic  regulatory  and political conditions affecting these assets  as well as to select the appropriate risk related rates for discounting estimated future cash flows  and to develop reasonable estimates of disposal values 
retirement benefits we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for substantially all of our domestic employees hired on or before december  in order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these retirement benefits  management must make a variety of estimates including discount rates used to value certain liabilities  expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these liabilities  rate of compensation increase  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
our benefit plan committee determines the key assumptions related to the discount rate  expected investment rate of return and compensation increases after consulting with the actuarial firm that performs the calculations 
other assumptions are also set based on consultation with our actuaries 
we base our estimates on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments on the measurement date 
the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date 
an increase in the discount rate reduces pension expense and liabilities 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined using historic market return trends together with  current market conditions and actual plan experience 
an increase in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reduces pension expense and liabilities 
the expected rate of compensation increase is determined based on our near term outlook and assumed inflation 
higher compensation rates increase the pension expense and liabilities 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
mortality rates are based on tables published by the insurance industry 
different estimates used by management could result in our recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
note to notes to consolidated financial statements describes details of our pension obligations and the expense for the year ended december  income taxes our reported effective tax rate applicable to continuing operations was for  compared with for the decline reflected the higher proportion of taxable income reported from lower tax jurisdictions 
most of our international operations are located in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates than the united states 
our effective tax rate is based on the expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe those positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve positions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
the rate is then applied to pre tax income reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
our estimates of income tax items  expense and reserves are considered to be critical accounting estimates because they are susceptible to change from period to period based on our judgments about a variety of factors 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved 
audits of our united states federal income tax returns have been completed through state income tax returns are audited more infrequently 
we also have unresolved audits of certain subsidiary income tax filings in the united kingdom for through unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of our cash and could result in the recoding of additional tax expense 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our tax provision in the year of resolution 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed international earnings since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
these undistributed earnings are approximately million at december  results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion below references the consolidated statement of operations on page f in part iv of this document 
net sales for the year ended december  were million compared with million for and million for in  the minerals segment accounted for of net sales while the environmental and transportation segments represented and  respectively 
minerals contributed approximately of the increase in net sales over the environmental and transportation segments contributed and  respectively  to the increase in net sales 
the largest component of the increase in net sales in and was recorded by colin stewart minchem csm  which was acquired as of may   and is included in the minerals segment 
other elements of the increase in net sales are described in the operating segment discussions below 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared with million for and million in the increase in gross profit in over resulted from the increase in net sales and lower production costs in the mineral segment businesses

approximately of the million increase in minerals net sales over was attributed to the january through april period in  which is the period in that csm was not owned 
net sales improved over in all three business units  metalcasting  pet products and specialty minerals 
metalcasting volumes improved in north america primarily from increased demand from certain foundry customers 
pricing also improved in certain product lines to offset higher raw material and shipping costs 
our asian metalcasting businesses also increased volumes over  particularly in china 
pet products sales increased due to higher volume and improved pricing  which was aided by lower customer discounts 
specialty minerals sales primarily improved due to higher volume to detergent customers 
oil and gas drilling volume also improved over gross profit increased over primarily as a result of the improvement in net sales described above 
in addition  productivity improvements in the pet products business decreased unit manufacturing costs 
higher volume and productivity improvements expanded gross margin by basis points to in the inclusion of a full year of costs related to csm  together with higher compensation and employee benefit costs accounted for a majority of the increase in general  selling and administrative expenses

intersegment sales and costs reported above reflect the elimination of these transactions 
corporate costs include management information systems  human resources  investor relations  corporate communications and finance 
additionally  marketing  research and operating costs related to the development of the nanocomposite business are included in this segment 
the increase in corporate general  selling and administrative expenses in related to higher compensation and employee benefit costs

 accounting for stock based compensation 
we elected to record stock based compensation costs using fair value under the prospective method 
lower nanocomposite development expenses in were due to a decline in research and development costs and increased revenue over vs 
intersegment shipping revenues and costs in were related to services provided by the transportation segment for certain domestic minerals and environmental segment businesses 
the services were provided at arms length rates and billed by the transportation segment to the minerals and environmental segments  which in turn billed their customers 
the intersegment shipping sales and costs in the table above reflect the elimination of these intersegment transactions 
approximately of the lower corporate administrative expenses in were associated with increased allocation of certain costs to the mineral  environmental and transportation segments 
the remaining decrease was attributed to lower personnel and legal costs 
the decline in nanocomposite expenses in was associated with a restructuring of the business that was implemented in the second quarter of investment income investment income in of million  or per diluted share  was associated with earnings on the temporary investment of proceeds received on the sale of the absorbent polymers segment 
the invested funds were liquidated in the third quarter of and used to pay down long term debt by million 
net interest expense net interest expense was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
as discussed above  we reduced debt in the third quarter of by liquidating funds previously invested in cash equivalent securities 
consequently  the decreases in and as compared to were primarily due to lower average debt levels 
other income expense other income in was approximately million 
in and  other income was less than million and approximately million  respectively 
this item reflects a number of miscellaneous transactions including gains and losses related to foreign exchange transactions and disposals of fixed assets 
the increase in was primarily attributed to recognized foreign exchange gains at our uk and poland businesses 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for was compared to in and in the principal driver of changes in our effective tax rate is the mix of earnings 
the decrease in the rate was due to increased taxable income in foreign jurisdictions which have lower statutory rates than the us the increased tax rate in was attributed to a greater portion of earnings generated in foreign jurisdictions with higher corporate income tax rates 
discontinued operations discontinued operations reflect the operating results of the uk metalcasting and cat litter businesses  which were sold or closed in income from discontinued operations was million in  or per diluted share  and million in  or per diluted share 
no proceeds were received in connection with the sale of the uk metalcasting business 
the acquirer leased certain land and buildings and pays us a royalty related to a license for use of certain trademarks 
the license agreement has a year term and the royalty is based on sales by the acquiring entity 
in connection with the sale of the uk metalcasting business  we realized a loss on the disposal of assets of million and recognized a tax benefit of million in the tax benefit recorded in was associated with the write off of our investment in our uk minerals subsidiary 
on february   the internal revenue service notified us that audits of certain federal income tax returns  including  had been completed and approved by the committee on joint taxation 
the return included deductions for certain loss associated with the disposal of the uk metalcasting and cat litter businesses 
upon receiving this notification  effective as of december   we revised our estimate of income taxes payable previously recorded to recognize an income tax receivable of million  including interest on the forthcoming refund 
other items a charge of per diluted share was recorded in related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the charge relates to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
net income net income for was million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
income from continuing operations in was million compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the differences between net income and income from continuing operations in and was attributed to income from discontinued operations  the major components of which were described previously 
the improvement in income from continuing operations in over was attributed to the increase in operating profit for the reasons described earlier in this report 
earnings per share diluted earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock  including common share equivalents  outstanding during the year 
stock options issued to key employees and directors are considered common share equivalents 
the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalent shares outstanding was approximately million in  million in and million in there were million shares outstanding  excluding common share equivalents  at december   compared to million at december   and million at december  the million share increase in was related to the issuance of million shares of treasury stock to employees in connection with the exercise of stock options 
this was offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock on the open market 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are analyzed below year ended december  investment income income from continuing operations excluding the above diluted earnings from continuing operations diluted earnings from continuing operations in were per share compared with per share in and per share in the improvement in over is commensurate with the increase in net income from continuing operations previously described 
net income was per diluted share in compared with per diluted share in and discontinued operations accounted for per diluted share in and per diluted share in cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle accounted of a loss of per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations  borrowings from a revolving credit facility and proceeds from the exercise of stock options by employees have been the sources of funds to purchase property  plants and equipment  acquire businesses  repurchase common stock  and pay dividends to shareholders 
we believe cash flows from operations and borrowings from an unused and committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to support our operating plans for the foreseeable future 
following is a discussion and analysis of our cash flow activities as presented on page f of part iv of this report 
during  cash provided by operating activities was million compared with million in and million in the decline in was primarily attributed to cash used for working capital of million in  compared with million of cash generated from working capital changes in accounts receivable and inventories increased by million and million  respectively  over  while accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million and million  respectively 
we consider the increase in these working capital components to be reasonable considering the growth in sales we experienced in days sales outstanding  a measure used to assess the collection period of accounts receivable balances  were days as of december   and days as of december  we use sales for the fourth quarter of each respective year to compute this measure 
the increase in days sales outstanding is due to higher accounts receivable amounts at our european and asian business units  which tend to have longer customer payment terms 
inventory turns were for both and this is computed by annualizing cost of goods sold for the fourth quarter of each respective year and dividing that result by the ending inventory balance 
net cash used in investing activities in was million compared with million in and million in the decline in from was due to less cash used for acquisitions million in versus million in 
in  we completed the acquisition of the stock of colin stewart minchem ltd 
for million 
in  our acquisitions included several small businesses 
in  we remitted million in state and federal income tax payments related to the sale of the absorbent polymers segment  which was the reason for the decline in cash used in investing activities in from acquisition of land  mineral reserves and depreciable assets was million in compared with million in and million in capital spending in the minerals segment was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the higher expenditures in and related to production capacity expansion projects completed in the us and asia 
capital spending in the environmental segment was million in compared with million in and million in capacity expansion projects in the us  europe and asia accounted for the increase in the remaining capital expenditures in  and were for corporate infrastructure improvements and miscellaneous projects for the transportation segment 
we foresee capital expenditures in to be comparable to while we continue to seek businesses to acquire that meet our strategic objectives  we cannot forecast any significant funding requirements for such activities in cash used in financing activities was million in compared with million in and million in the increase in was primarily attributed to net repayments of debt which totaled million  while in we had net borrowings of million 
acquisitions completed in were the primary reason for the net borrowings 
net debt repayments totaled million in we liquidated temporary investments in the third quarter of and used the funds to repay debt 
we repurchased million of our common stock in compared to million in and million in approximately million remains in a stock repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in may the valuation of our common stock in and as reflected by our trading price was at such a level that we felt it presented a good value to our shareholders to use cash for stock repurchases 
dividends on our common stock were million in compared with million in declared dividends rose from per share in to per share in the increase reflected the improvement in our earnings and cash flows in as of december   we had outstanding debt of million and cash of million  compared with million of outstanding debt and million of cash at december  long term debt including current maturities represented of total capitalization at december   compared with at december  we had a current ratio of to as of december   and working capital of approximately million  compared with to and million  respectively  as of december  the current ratio and working capital increased due to the growth in sales we experienced in and the million decrease in the portion of long term debt classified as a current liability 
the following schedule sets forth details of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less total than after year years years years in millions contractual obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations bank debt includes million due under a revolving credit agreement  which provides for a commitment of million in borrowing capacity and matures on october  borrowing rates on the facility can range from to above the month london inter bank offered rate libor depending upon the amount of the credit line used and certain capitalization ratios 
the facility requires certain covenants to be met including specific amounts of net worth  and also limits our ability to make additional borrowings and guarantees 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  operating leases relate to non cancelable obligations for railroad cars  truck trailers  computer software  office equipment  certain automobiles  and office and plant facilities 
details of the operating leases are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item since the mid s  we and or our subsidiaries have been named as one of a number of defendants in product liability lawsuits relating to the minor free silica content our bentonite products used in the metalcasting industry 
the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are primarily employees of our foundry customers 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs in defending these matters 
we believe we have adequate insurance coverage and do not believe the litigation will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  liquidity or results of the operations 
forward looking statements and risk factors certain statements we make from time to time  including statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section above  constitute forward looking statements made in reliance upon the safe harbor contained in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements include statements relating to our company or our operations that are preceded by terms such as expects  believes  anticipates  intends and similar expressions  and statements relating to anticipated growth  levels of capital expenditures  future dividends  expansion into global markets and the development of new products 
such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from the results  performance or achievements expressed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including without limitation the following competition the minerals market is very competitive 
we believe competition is essentially a matter of product quality  price  delivery  service and technical support 
several of our competitors in the us market are larger and have substantially greater financial resources 
if we fail to compete successfully based on these or other factors  we may lose customers or fail to recruit new customers and our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
reliance on metalcasting and construction industries approximately of our minerals segment s sales and of our environmental segment s sales in were to the metalcasting and construction markets  respectively 
the metalcasting and construction markets depend heavily upon the strength of the domestic and international economies 
if these economies weaken  demand for products by the metalcasting and construction markets may decline and our business or future financial results in the minerals and environmental segments may be adversely affected 
regulatory and legal matters our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment and to health and safety matters 
substantial penalties may be imposed if we violate certain of these laws and regulations even if the violation was inadvertent or unintentional 
if these laws or regulations are changed or interpreted differently in the future  it may become more difficult or expensive for us to comply 
in addition  investigations or evaluations of our products by government agencies may require us to adopt additional safety measures or precautions 
if our costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future materially increase  our business and future financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we may also be subject to adverse litigation results in addition to increased compliance costs arising from future changes in laws and regulations that may negatively impact our operations and profits 
risks of international expansion an important part of our business strategy is to expand internationally 
we intend to seek acquisitions  joint ventures and strategic alliances globally 
in  our business outside the united states represented approximately of our consolidated sales 
the approximate breakdown of the sales outside of the united states for was as follows europe  asia pacific  and other regions 
as we expand internationally  we will be subject to increased risks  which may include the following o currency exchange or price control laws  o currency translation adjustments  o political and economic instability  o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  o tariffs and other trade barriers  o longer accounts receivable collection cycles  and o adverse tax consequences 
the above listed events could result in sudden  and potentially prolonged  changes in demand our products 
also  we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting accounts receivable through a foreign country s legal system 
at december   approximately of the gross accounts receivable were due from customers outside of the united states and canada 
the breakdown of the overseas balance was as follows europe  asia pacific  and other regions 
bulk cargo shipping costs are rising significantly due to acute demand from china 
we rely on shipping bulk cargos of bentonite from the us and china to customers as wells as our own subsidiaries 
this issue is not isolated to amcol  however  we may need to offset additional shipping costs with price increases to customers in order to maintain our profitability 
we are also reviewing our shipping patterns to determine more cost effective means of transporting bulk cargos 
volatility of stock price the stock market has been extremely volatile in recent years 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  factors such as the following may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock o fluctuations in our financial results  o our introduction of new services or products  o announcements of acquisitions  strategic alliances or joint ventures by us  our customers or our competitors  o changes in analysts recommendations regarding our common stock  and o general economic conditions 
there can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will increase in the future or be maintained at its recent levels
