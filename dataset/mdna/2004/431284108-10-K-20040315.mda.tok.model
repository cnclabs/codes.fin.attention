table of contents overview we are a fully integrated  self administered reit that provides leasing  management  development  construction and other customer related services for our properties and for third parties 
as of december   we own or have an interest in in service office  industrial and retail properties encompassing approximately million square feet 
we also own  acres of development land which is suitable to develop approximately million rentable square feet of office  industrial and retail space 
we are based in raleigh  north carolina  and our properties and development land are located in florida  georgia  iowa  kansas  maryland  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
results of operations during  approximately of our rental revenue was derived from our office properties see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the accounting for our rental revenue 
as a result  while we own and operate a limited number of industrial and retail properties  our operating results depend heavily on successfully leasing our office properties 
furthermore  since most of our office properties are located in florida  georgia and north carolina  employment growth in those states is and will continue to be an important determinative factor in predicting our future operating results 
the key components affecting our revenue stream are average occupancy and rental rates 
during the past several years  as the average occupancy of our portfolio has decreased  our same property rental revenue has declined 
average occupancy generally increases during times of improving economic growth  as our ability to lease space outpaces vacancies that occur upon the expirations of existing leases  while average occupancy generally declines during times of slower economic growth  when new vacancies tend to outpace our ability to lease space 
asset acquisitions and dispositions also impact our rental revenues and could impact our average occupancy  depending upon the occupancy percentage of the properties that are acquired or sold 
whether or not our rental revenue tracks average occupancy proportionally depends upon whether rents under new leases are higher or lower than the rents under the previous leases 
during  the average rate per square foot on a gaap basis on new leases was only lower than the average rate per square foot on the expired leases 
a further indicator of the predictability of future revenues is the expected lease expirations of our portfolio 
our average suburban office lease term  excluding renewal periods is years 
in  leases on approximately million square feet of space will expire that have not been renewed as of december  this square footage represents approximately of our annualized revenue 
as of february   we have renewed or signed new leases aggregating million square feet of space with start dates  or of the square footage expiring during as a result  in addition to seeking to increase our average occupancy by leasing current vacant space  we also must concentrate our leasing efforts on renewing leases on expiring space 
for more information regarding our lease expirations  see properties lease expirations 
our expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization  general administrative expenses  rental property expenses and interest expense 
depreciation and amortization is a non cash expense associated with the ownership of real property and generally remains relatively consistent each year  unless we buy or sell assets  since we depreciate our properties on a straight line basis 
general and administrative expenses  net of amounts capitalized  consist primarily of management and employee salaries and other personnel costs  corporate overhead and long term incentive compensation  and generally remain relatively consistent from period to period and have ranged from to of our total expenses over the past few years 
rental property expenses are expenses associated with our ownership and operating of rental properties and include variable expenses  such as common area maintenance and utilities  and fixed expenses  such as property taxes and insurance 
some of these variable expenses may be lower as our average occupancy declines  while the fixed expenses remain constant regardless of average occupancy 
interest expense depends upon the amount of our borrowings  the weighted average interest rates on our debt and the amount capitalized on development projects 
under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  certain expenses related to the development  construction and leasing of properties  such as construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and other costs relating to such activities  are capitalized rather than expensed as incurred 
as a result  during times of increased development  construction and successful leasing activity  certain of our general and administrative expenses may actually be lower because some fixed overhead costs are properly capitalized  and then amortized over the lives of various projects rather than expensed during the period incurred 

table of contents we also record income from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which are our joint ventures 
these joint ventures are not consolidated on our balance sheet 
we record in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates our proportionate share of the joint venture s net income or loss as part of other income 
during  income earned from our joint ventures accounted for approximately of our total net income 
additionally  sfas requires us to record net income received from properties sold or held for sale separately as income from discontinued operations 
as a result  we separately record revenues and expenses from these properties 
during  income  including gains and losses from the sale of properties  from discontinued operations accounted for approximately of our total net income 
liquidity and capital resources we incur capital expenditures to lease space to our customers and to maintain the quality of our properties to successfully compete against other properties 
tenant improvements are the costs required to customize the space for the specific needs of the customer 
lease commissions are costs incurred to find the customer for the space 
building improvements are recurring capital costs not related to a customer to maintain the buildings 
as leases expire  we either attempt to relet the space to an existing customer or attract a new customer to occupy the space 
generally  customer renewals require lower leasing capital than reletting to a new customer 
however  market conditions such as supply of available space on the market  as well as demand for space  drive not only customer rental rates but also tenant improvement costs 
leasing capital expenditures are amortized over the term of the lease and building improvements are depreciated over the appropriate useful life of the assets acquired 
both are included in depreciation and amortization in results of operations 
because we are a reit  we are required under the federal tax laws to distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our stockholders 
we generally use rents received from customers to fund our operating expenses  recurring capital expenditures and stockholder dividends 
to fund property acquisitions  development activity or building renovations  we incur debt from time to time 
as of december   we had approximately million of secured debt outstanding and million of unsecured debt outstanding 
our debt consists of mortgage debt  unsecured debt securities and borrowings under our revolving loan 
as of march   we have million of additional borrowing availability under our revolving loan 
as of the date of this filing  our short term cash needs include the funding of million in development activity and million in principal payments due on our long term debt in the next year 
our revolving loan and the indenture governing our outstanding long term unsecured debt securities each require us to satisfy various operating and financial covenants and performance ratios 
as a result  to ensure that we do not violate the provisions of these debt instruments  we may from time to time be limited in undertaking certain activities that may otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders  such as repurchasing capital stock  acquiring additional assets  increasing the total amount of our debt  or increasing stockholder dividends 
we review our current and expected operating results  financial condition and planned strategic actions on an ongoing basis for the purpose of monitoring our continued compliance with these covenants and ratios 
while we are currently in compliance with these covenants and ratios and expect to remain so for the foreseeable future  we cannot provide any assurance of such continued compliance and any failure to remain in compliance could result in an acceleration of some or all of our debt  severely restrict our ability to incur additional debt to fund short and long term cash needs  or result in higher interest expense 
to generate additional capital to fund our growth and other strategic initiatives and to lessen the ownership risks typically associated with owning of a property  we may sell some of our properties or contribute them to joint ventures 
when we create a joint venture with a strategic partner  we usually contribute one or more properties that we own and or vacant land to a newly formed entity in which we retain an interest of or less 
in exchange for our equal or minority interest in the joint venture  we generally receive cash from the partner and retain all of the management income relating to the properties in the joint venture 
the joint venture itself will frequently borrow money on its own behalf to finance the acquisition of and or leverage the return upon the properties being acquired by the joint venture or to build or acquire additional buildings  typically on a non recourse or limited recourse basis 
we generally are not liable for the debts of our joint ventures  except to the extent of our equity investment  unless we have directly guaranteed any of that debt 
in most cases  we and or our strategic partners are required to guarantee customary exceptions to non recourse liability in non recourse loans 

table of contents we have historically also sold additional common stock or preferred stock  or issued common units  to fund additional growth or to reduce our debt  but have limited those efforts during the past five years because of our ability to generally incur debt at a lower cost 
we currently have an effective shelf registration statement with the sec pursuant to which the company could sell up to million of common stock and the operating partnership could sell up to million of unsecured debt securities 
management s analysis in measuring  analyzing and comparing our operating performance  we use a number of different criteria  including gaap financial measures  such as net income  and non gaap financial measures  such as funds from operations ffo 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
see funds from operations and cash available for distributions 
however  we believe that ffo is one of several indicators of the performance of an equity reit 
ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits because it excludes factors  such as depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate assets  which are based on historical cost and may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo 
in measuring  analyzing and comparing our financial condition  management uses a number of other criteria  such as total debt as a percentage of total market capitalization  the weighted average interest rate of our secured and unsecured debt  our borrowing capacity and cash available for distributions cad 
cad provides us with an additional basis to evaluate our ability to incur and service debt  fund acquisitions  leasing and other capital expenditures and pay dividends to stockholders 
cad  which is a non gaap financial measure  does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
see funds from operations and cash available for distribution 

table of contents results of operations on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we reclassified the operations and or gain loss from disposal of certain properties to discontinued operations for all periods presented if the properties were either sold during and or were held for sale at december  and met certain conditions as stipulated by sfas accordingly  the operations and gain loss from those properties disposed of during and certain properties disposed of during were not reclassified to discontinued operations 
comparison of to the following table sets forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  to change of change rental revenue operating expenses rental property depreciation and amortization general and administrative includes nonrecurring compensation expense in litigation expense total operating expenses interest expense contractual amortization of deferred financing costs other income interest and other income equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates income before gain on disposition of land and depreciable assets  minority interest and discontinued operations gain on disposition of land gain on disposition of depreciable assets income before minority interest and discontinued operations minority interest income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of minority interest gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of minority interest net income dividends on preferred stock net income available for common stockholders 
table of contents rental revenue the decrease in rental revenue from continuing operations was primarily a result of a decrease in average occupancy rates from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in average occupancy rates was primarily a result of the bankruptcies of worldcom and us airways  which decreased average occupancy rates by and rental revenue from continuing operations by million 
same property rental revenue decreased by million 
see below for additional discussion on same property rental revenue 
partly offsetting these decreases  during  approximately million square feet of development properties were placed in service and  as a result  increased rental revenues from continuing operations by approximately million 
in addition  the acquisition of certain mg hiw  llc assets in july have increased rental revenues by million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
recovery income from certain operating expenses have decreased in the year ended december  due to lower occupancy 
same property rental revenue generated from the million square feet of our wholly owned in service properties that were owned throughout the period from january  to december   decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of lower same property average occupancy  which decreased from in to in the decrease in same property average occupancy was primarily a result of the bankruptcies of worldcom and us airways  which decreased same property average occupancy rates by and same property rental revenue from continuing operations by million 
during the year ended december   second generation leases representing million square feet of office  industrial and retail space were executed 
the average rate per square foot on a gaap basis over the lease term for leases executed in the year ended december  was only lower than the rent paid by previous customers 
as of the date of this filing  we are beginning to see a modest improvement in employment trends in a few of our markets and an improving economic climate in the southeast 
however  we expect a lag between positive employment growth and positive absorption of office space due to the significant amount of vacancies  under utilized space and space available for sublease in our markets 
we anticipate that occupancy in our in service portfolio will decrease slightly in the first half of and increase slightly in the second half of this outlook is based on the level of leasing activity we have experienced over the past months  which we expect to continue through  our expected renewal rates and other factors 
in  leases on approximately million square feet of space will expire that have not been renewed as of december  this square footage represents approximately of our annualized revenue 
as of february   we have renewed or signed new leases aggregating million square feet of space with start dates  or of the square footage expiring during because of an oversupply of office space in many of our southeastern markets  we continue to expect straight line rents under new leases to be lower than the straight line rents under the expiring leases 
as noted above  during  the average rate per square foot on a gaap basis on new leases was only lower than the average rate per square foot on the expired leases 
operating expenses the increase in rental operating expenses from continuing operations real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance and other property related expenses was a result of an increase in certain fixed operating expenses that do not vary with net changes in our occupancy percentages  such as real estate taxes  insurance and utility rate changes  and an increase in operating expenses which resulted from the acquisition of certain mg hiw assets in july in addition  we had million square feet of development properties placed in service during which resulted in an increase in rental operating expenses from continuing operations 
rental operating expenses as a percentage of rental revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase was a result of the increases in rental operating expenses as described above and a decrease in rental revenue  primarily due to lower average occupancy  as described above 

table of contents same property rental operating expenses  which are the expenses related to the wholly owned in service properties that were owned throughout the period from january  to december   increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the increase was a result of increases in certain fixed operating expenses that do not vary with net changes in our occupancy percentages  such as real estate taxes  insurance and utility rate changes 
same property rental operating expenses as a percentage of related revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in these expenses as a percentage of related revenue was a result of the increase in same property rental operating expenses as described above and a decrease in same property rental revenue  primarily due to the bankruptcies of worldcom and us airways  as previously discussed 
in addition  operating expenses of million that would have been paid by worldcom if the leases were not rejected were paid by us and included in same property operating expenses during the year ended december  we expect property operating expenses to increase slightly in due to inflationary increases along with increases in certain fixed operating expenses that do not vary with occupancy such as real estate taxes and utility rate changes 
the increase in depreciation and amortization from continuing operations related to buildings  leasing commissions and tenant improvement expenditures for properties placed in service during and the write off of deferred leasing costs and tenant improvements for customers who vacated their space prior to lease expiration 
in addition  the increase resulted from the acquisition of certain mg hiw assets in july and depreciation and amortization on million rentable square feet of development properties placed in service during general and administrative expenses from continuing operations  net of amounts capitalized  as a percentage of the aggregate of rental revenues  and interest and other income for both continuing and discontinued operations and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to a decrease of capitalization of general and administrative costs due to the decrease in development and leasing activity in and an increase in long term incentive compensation expense as a result of the issuance of restricted and phantom stock during and in  general and administrative expenses also included higher expenses related to employee compensation 
in addition  rental revenue and interest and other income decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  partly offsetting these increases was a million non recurring compensation expense in we incurred million in the year ended december  for litigation expense related to various legal proceedings from previously completed mergers and acquisitions 
these claims were fully settled by early in  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase due to inflationary increases in compensation  benefits and other expenses related to the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act 
interest expense as a result of decreased development activity in  capitalized interest decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   resulting in an increase in interest expense from continuing operations in partly offsetting this increase was a decrease in the average outstanding debt balance of million from to and a decrease in average interest rates from in to in interest expense for the years ended december  and included million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred financing costs 
the increase of million was primarily a result of financing costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the mandatory par put remarketed securities mopprs 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion on the refinancing 
interest expense is expected to decline in primarily due to the december  refinancing of certain long term debt  see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of this refinancing  offset by any increases in average debt balances resulting from acquisitions or other activities 

table of contents interest and other income the decrease in interest and other income is primarily related to the collection of a legal settlement recorded in the year ended december  related to previously completed mergers and acquisitions along with a decrease in interest income due to the collection of notes receivable during the years ended december  and and lower interest rates earned on cash reserves 
leasing fee income and development fee income decreased in the year ended december  due to lower demand for real estate slightly offset by an increase in management fee income due to the company retaining the management of some of our properties that were sold to third parties or contributed to joint ventures during the years ended december  and the decrease in equity in earnings from continuing operations of unconsolidated affiliates was primarily a result of a charge of million  which represents our proportionate share of the impairment loss of million recorded by the mg hiw  llc joint venture in the year ended december   related to our acquisition of the assets of the mg hiw  llc joint venture and lower occupancy in for certain joint ventures 
partly offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in equity in earnings in related to a charge of million taken in due to an early extinguishment of debt loss taken by a certain joint venture and an increase in equity in earnings in of million as a result of a gain recognized by a certain joint venture related to the disposition of land in gain on disposition of land and depreciable assets in  the majority of the gain was comprised of a million gain related to the disposition of acres of land and a gain of approximately million related to the condemnation of acres of land 
partly offsetting these gains was an impairment loss of million related to three land parcels held for sale at december  in  the majority of the gain was comprised of a million gain related to the disposition of  square feet of office properties  that did not meet certain conditions to be classified as discontinued operations as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and a million gain related to the disposition of acres of land 
the gains were partly offset by an impairment loss of approximately million recorded in related to a property that has been demolished and will be redeveloped into a class a suburban office property 
discontinued operations in accordance with sfas  we classified net income of million and million  net of minority interest  as discontinued operations for the year ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts pertained to million square feet of property  four apartment units and acres of revenue producing land sold during and and  square feet of property and apartment units held for sale at december  we also classified as discontinued operations gain on the sale of these properties of million and million  net of minority interest  in and  respectively 
partly offsetting these gains were impairment charges of million and million  net of minority interest  in and  respectively 
in addition  in accordance with sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  we deferred the recognition of an additional gain of million relating to the disposition to a third party buyer of  square feet during the fourth quarter of for which we guaranteed the buyer up to million of rental shortfalls or re tenanting costs 
additionally  in we have deferred the recognition of additional gain of million relating to the dispositions to third party buyers of approximately million rentable square feet for which we have guaranteed the buyers certain rental shortfalls and re tenanting costs 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
preferred stock dividends we recorded million in preferred stock dividends in each of the years ended december  and 
table of contents net income we recorded net income in of million  which was a decrease from net income of million in  primarily due to a decrease in rental revenues as a result of lower occupancy and the bankruptcies of worldcom and us airways  the disposition of certain properties under our capital recycling plan  an increase in rental property operating expenses  an increase in depreciation and amortization and a decrease in gain on the disposition of land and depreciable assets 
in  we expect net income to be lower as compared with due to flat average occupancy and pressure on rental rates  higher depreciation and amortization  higher property operating costs  and higher general and administrative costs  offset by lower interest expense 
comparison of to the following table sets forth information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  to change of change rental revenue operating expenses rental property depreciation and amortization general and administrative includes nonrecurring compensation expense in litigation expense total operating expenses interest expense contractual amortization of deferred financing costs other income interest and other income equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates income before gain on disposition of land and depreciable assets  minority interest and discontinued operations gain on disposition of land gain on disposition of depreciable assets income before minority interest and discontinued operations minority interest income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of minority interest gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of minority interest net income dividends on preferred stock net income available for common stockholders 
table of contents rental revenue the decrease in rental revenue from continuing operations was primarily due to a decrease in average occupancy rates from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the average occupancy decreased mainly due to tenant rollover and early lease terminations at various properties where vacant space was not re leased due to the lack of demand for office space coupled with an increasing supply of competitive space 
during  approximately million square feet of development properties were placed in service which have leased up slower than expected and as a result  have also adversely affected the occupancy of our overall portfolio 
rental revenue also decreased due to the impact of dispositions during and that were not classified as discontinued operations as more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as a result of the bankruptcy of worldcom and its affiliates  we wrote off approximately million of accrued straight line rent receivable in the year ended december  same property rental revenue  generated from the million square feet of wholly owned in service properties that were owned throughout the period from january  to december   decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of lower same store average occupancy  which decreased from in to in  and a decrease in straight line rental income primarily as a result of the bankruptcy of worldcom and its affiliates 
during the year ended december   second generation leases representing million square feet of office  industrial and retail space were executed at an average rate per square foot which was lower than the average rate per square foot on the expired leases 
operating expenses rental operating expenses from continuing operations real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  repairs and maintenance and other property related expenses as a percentage of rental revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in these expenses as a percentage of revenue was a result of increases in repairs and maintenance and certain fixed operating expenses such as real estate taxes that do not vary with net changes in our occupancy average 
same property rental operating expenses of the in service properties wholly owned that were owned throughout the period from january  to december   decreased million or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  same property rental operating expenses as a percentage of related revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue was a result of increases in repairs and maintenance and certain fixed operating expenses such as real estate taxes that do not vary with net changes in our occupancy average 
the increase in depreciation and amortization from continuing operations was due to an increase in amortization related to leasing commissions and tenant improvement expenditures for properties placed in service during and and the write off of million of deferred leasing costs primarily related to the leases rejected by worldcom at december  these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation for properties disposed of during and that are not classified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas general and administrative expenses from continuing operations  net of amounts capitalized  as a percentage of the aggregate of rental revenues  interest and other income for both continuing and discontinued operations and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was in and in included in general and administrative expenses in was a nonrecurring compensation charge of million related to the exercise of options 
such exercises were recorded as compensation expense under fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock options  an interpretation of apb opinion no 

we no longer settle option exercises in a manner which would require recognition of compensation expense under fasb interpretation no 
in the event we decide to repurchase shares after an option exercise  we will require the option holder to pay the cash for the strike price and then separately repurchase a corresponding number of shares in the market under our stock repurchase program 

table of contents we incurred million in the year ended december  for litigation expense related to various legal proceedings from previously completed mergers and acquisitions 
these claims were fully settled in early interest expense capitalized interest decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   resulting in an increase in interest expense from continuing operations in partly offsetting this increase was a decrease in average interest rates from in to in the average outstanding debt balance remained relatively consistent for and interest expense for the years ended december  and included million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred financing costs and costs related to our interest rate hedge contracts 
interest and other income the decrease in interest and other income from continuing operations primarily resulted from a decrease in leasing and development fee income in the year ended december  and a decrease in interest income in the year ended december  due to the collection of notes receivable during and the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was primarily a result of lower lease termination fees and lower property operating expense reimbursements in the decrease in earnings was partly offset by lower interest expense incurred during as a result of lower weighted average borrowing rates and earnings from certain joint ventures formed with unrelated investors during gain on disposition of land and depreciable assets in  the majority of the gain was comprised of a gain related to the disposition of  square feet of office properties that did not meet certain conditions to be classified as discontinued operations as described in note of the consolidated financial statements and a gain related to the disposition of acres of land 
the gain is partly offset by an impairment loss of approximately million recorded in related to a property that has been demolished and will be redeveloped into a class a suburban office property 
in  the majority of the gain was comprised of a gain related to the disposition of  apartment units and a gain related to the disposition of acres of land 
discontinued operations in accordance with sfas  we classified net income of million and million  net of minority interest  as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  which pertained to million square feet of property  four apartment units and acres of revenue producing land sold during and and  square feet of property and apartment units held for sale at december  we also classified as discontinued operations in the gain on the sale of these properties of million  net of minority interest  partly offset by impairment charges of million  net of minority interest 
in addition  in accordance with sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  we deferred the recognition of additional gain of million  million net of minority interest  relating to the disposition to a third party buyer of  square feet during the fourth quarter of for which we guaranteed the buyer up to million of rental shortfalls or re tenanting costs 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
preferred stock dividends we recorded million and million in preferred stock dividends for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease resulted from the company s repurchase of million of its preferred stock during 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources statement of cash flows as required by gaap  we report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
the following table sets forth the changes in the company s cash flows from to in thousands year ended december  change cash provided by operating activities cash provided by investing activities cash used in financing activities total cash flows in calculating cash flow from operating activities  gaap requires us to add depreciation and amortization  which are non cash expenses  back to net income 
as a result  we have historically generated a significant positive amount of cash from operating activities 
from period to period  cash flow from operations depends primarily upon changes in our net income  as discussed more fully above under results of operations  changes in receivables and payables  and net additions or decreases in our overall portfolio  which affect the amount of depreciation and amortization expense 
cash provided by or used in investing activities generally relates to capitalized costs incurred for leasing and major building improvements  and our acquisition  disposition and joint venture activity 
during periods of significant net acquisition activity  our cash used in such investing activities will generally exceed cash provided by investing activities  which typically would consist of cash received upon the sale of properties or distributions from our joint ventures 
during and  since our disposition and joint venture activity slightly outpaced our acquisition activity  we recorded positive cash flow from investing activities in both years 
cash used in financing activities generally relates to stockholder dividends  incurrence and repayment of debt and sales or repurchases of common stock and preferred stock 
as discussed previously  we use a significant amount of our cash to fund stockholder dividends 
whether or not we incur significant new debt during a period depends generally upon the net effect of our acquisition  disposition  development and joint venture activity 
we use our revolving loan for working capital purposes  which means that during any given period  in order to minimize interest expense associated with balances outstanding under the revolving loan  we will likely record significant repayments and borrowings under the revolving loan 
the decrease of million in cash provided by operating activities was primarily a result of lower net income due to the disposition of certain properties under our capital recycling program  a decrease in average occupancy rates for our wholly owned portfolio and the bankruptcies of worldcom and us airways 
in addition  the level of net cash provided by operating activities is affected by the timing of receipt of revenues and payment of expenses 
the decrease of million in cash provided by investing activities was primarily a result of a decrease in proceeds from dispositions of real estate assets of approximately million and an increase in additions to real estate assets of approximately million 
the decrease of million in cash used in financing activities was primarily a result of a decrease of million in net repayments on the unsecured revolving loan  mortgages and notes payable and a decrease of million in distributions paid on common stock and common units  partly offset by an increase of million for the repurchase of common stock and units and the settlement of an interest rate swap agreement for million for the year ended december  in  we expect to continue our capital recycling program of selectively disposing of non core properties or other properties in order to use the net proceeds for investments or other purposes 
at december   we had  square feet of office properties  apartment units and acres of land under letter of intent or contract for sale in various transactions with a carrying value of million 
these transactions are subject to customary closing conditions  including due diligence and documentation  and are expected to close during however  we can provide no assurance that these transactions will be consummated 

table of contents during  we expect to have positive cash flows from operating activities 
the net cash flows from investing activities in could be positive or negative  depending on the level and timing of property dispositions  property acquisitions and capitalized leasing and improvement costs 
any positive cash flows from investing activities in are expected to be used to pay stockholder and unitholder distributions  required debt amortization  and recurring capital expenditures 
capitalization the following table sets forth our capitalization as of december  and december  in thousands  except per share amounts december  december  mortgages and notes payable  at recorded book value preferred stock  at redemption value common shares and units outstanding per share stock price at period end market value of common equity total market capitalization with debt based on our total market capitalization of approximately billion at december  at the december  per share stock price of and assuming the redemption for shares of common stock of the million common units of minority interest in the operating partnership  our debt represented approximately of our total market capitalization 
our total indebtedness at december  was approximately billion and was comprised of million of secured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of and million of unsecured indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 
as of december   our outstanding mortgage and loans payable and the secured revolving loan were secured by real estate assets with an aggregate carrying value of approximately billion

table of contents refinancings in on february   the operating partnership repurchased of the principal amount of the mandatory par put remarketed securities mopprs due february  from the sole holder thereof in exchange for a secured note in the principal amount of million 
the secured note bears interest at a fixed rate of and has a maturity date of february  this transaction was accounted for as an exchange of indebtedness under eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
in accordance with eitf  the intermediaries acted as principals and the present value of the cash flows under the terms of the new debt instrument using the mopprs effective interest rate was less than different from the present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the mopprs 
accordingly  the transaction was considered an exchange  not an extinguishment and no loss was recognized 
the option premium paid to the lender was million and was recorded as a deferred financing cost and will be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the new debt 
fees paid by us to third parties such as legal fees were expensed as incurred 
on july   we amended and restated our existing revolving loan 
the amended and restated million revolving loan the revolving loan is from a group of ten lender banks  matures in july and replaces our previous million revolving loan 
the revolving loan carries an interest rate based upon our senior unsecured credit ratings 
as a result  interest currently accrues on borrowings under the revolving loan at a rate of libor plus basis points 
the terms of the revolving loan require us to pay an annual facility fee equal to 
of the aggregate amount of the revolving loan 
we currently have a credit rating of bbb assigned by standard poor s and fitch inc in august  moody s investor service downgraded our credit rating from baa to ba we cannot provide any assurances moody s or the other rating agencies will not further change our credit ratings 
if standard and poor s or fitch inc were to lower our credit ratings without a corresponding increase by moody s  the interest rate on borrowings under our revolving loan would be automatically increased by basis points 
on december   million of our notes and million of our notes matured 
we refinanced million with year secured debt at an effective rate of 
million was refinanced with a two year unsecured term loan with a floating rate initially set at over libor 
the balance  equaling million  was repaid using funds from our million revolving loan 
anticipated refinancings in in  a trust formed by the operating partnership sold million of exercisable put option securities due june  x pos 
the assets of the trust consist of  among other things  million of exercisable put option notes due june  the put option notes  issued by the operating partnership 
the put option notes bear an interest rate of from the date of issuance through june  after june   the interest rate to maturity on the put option notes will be plus the applicable spread determined as of june  in connection with the initial issuance of the put option notes  a counter party was granted an option to purchase the put option notes from the trust on june  at of the principal amount 
if the counter party elects not to exercise this option  the operating partnership would be required to repurchase the put option notes from the trust on june  at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we currently anticipate that no later than june  we will call or repurchase million of the x pos and the third party purchase option 
we will exchange the x pos for a similar amount of new bonds 
we anticipate that these transactions will be accounted for as an exchange of indebtedness under eitf and accordingly no gain or loss would be recorded 
additionally  we anticipate the transaction will have no material effect on future interest expense assuming current market rates and conditions remain constant 
however  any such transaction will depend upon our ability to favorably access the credit market and  accordingly  no assurances can be provided that we will be successful in refinancing the put option note on favorable terms  if at all 

table of contents operating and financial covenants and performance ratios the terms of the revolving loan and the indentures that govern our outstanding notes require us to comply with certain operating and financial covenants and performance ratios 
we are currently in compliance with all such requirements 
although we expect to remain in compliance with the covenants and ratios under our revolving loans for at least the next several quarters  depending upon our future operating performance and property and financing transactions  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be in compliance 
the following table sets forth more detailed information about the company s ratio and covenant compliance under the revolving loan as of december  and certain of these definitions may differ from similar terms used in the consolidated financial statements and may  for example  consider our proportionate share of investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
for a more detailed description of the covenants in our revolving loan  including definitions of certain relevant terms  see the credit agreement governing our revolving loan which is incorporated by reference in this annual report as exhibit

in addition  construction management  maintenance  leasing and management fees have provided sources of cash flow 
major capital improvements to the existing properties total million  as indicated in the known contractual obligation summary 
in addition  we could incur tenant improvements and lease commissions related to any releasing of space previously leased by worldcom and us airways or other vacant space 
in addition to the requirements discussed above  our short term within the next months liquidity requirements also include the funding of approximately million of our existing development activity as of the date of this filing and first generation tenant improvements and lease commissions on properties placed in service that are not fully leased 
we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements through a combination of working capital  cash flows from operations and the following 
table of contents borrowings under our unsecured revolving loan up to million of availability as of march   the selective disposition of non core assets or other assets  the sale or contribution of some of our wholly owned properties  development projects and development land to strategic joint ventures to be formed with unrelated investors  which will have the net effect of generating additional capital through such sale or contributions  and the issuance of secured debt at february   we had billion of unencumbered real estate assets at cost 
our long term liquidity needs generally include the funding of existing and future development activity  selective asset acquisitions and the retirement of mortgage debt  amounts outstanding under the two revolving loans and long term unsecured debt 
we remain committed to maintaining a flexible capital structure 
accordingly  we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through a combination of the issuance by the operating partnership of additional unsecured debt securities  the issuance of additional equity securities by the company and the operating partnership as well as the sources described above with respect to our short term liquidity 
we expect to use such sources to meet our long term liquidity requirements either through direct payments or repayment of borrowings under the unsecured revolving loan 
as mentioned above  we do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured indebtedness upon maturity 
instead  we will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
we anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  with cash available from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs in both the short and long term 
however  if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and satisfy other cash payments may be adversely affected 
stockholder dividends to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must distribute to stockholders at least of our reit taxable income 
reit taxable income  the calculation of which is determined by the federal tax laws  does not necessarily equal net income under gaap 
we generally expect to use our cash flow from operating activities for dividends to stockholders and for payment of recurring capital expenditures 
future dividends will be made at the discretion of the our board of directors 
the following factors will affect our cash flows and  accordingly  influence the decisions of the board of directors regarding dividends debt service requirements after taking into account debt covenants and the repayment and restructuring of certain indebtedness  scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases  changes in rents attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases  changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and execution of leases for newly acquired or developed properties  and operating expenses and capital replacement needs  including tenant improvements and leasing costs 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements the company has several off balance sheet joint venture and guarantee arrangements 
the joint ventures were formed with unrelated investors to generate additional capital to fund property acquisitions  repay outstanding debt or fund other strategic initiatives and to lessen the ownership risks typically associated with owning of a property 
when we create a joint venture with a strategic partner  we usually contribute one or more properties that we own to a newly formed entity in which we retain an interest of or less 
in exchange for an equal or minority interest in the joint venture  we generally receive cash from the partner and retain the management income relating to the properties in the joint venture 
as of december   our joint ventures had million of total assets and million of total liabilities 
during  these joint ventures earned million of total net income  net of a million impairment charge related to our purchase of the mg hiw  llc assets 
we have a weighted average equity interest in these joint ventures 
for a more detailed discussion of our joint venture activity  see note in the consolidated financial statements 
as required by gaap  we have accounted for our joint venture activity using the equity method of accounting  as we do not control these joint ventures 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of our joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet and the results of operations of the joint ventures are not included on our income statement  other than as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
in other words  we generally are not liable for the debts of our joint ventures  except to the extent of our equity investment  unless we have directly guaranteed any of that debt 
in most cases  we and or our strategic partners are required to guarantee customary exceptions to non recourse liability in non recourse loans 
as of december   our joint ventures had million of outstanding debt

all of this joint venture debt is non recourse to us except in the case of customary exceptions pertaining to such matters as misuse of funds  environmental conditions and material misrepresentations and those guarantees and loans described in the following paragraphs 

table of contents in connection with the des moines joint venture guarantees  the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is million 
of this amount  million arose from housing revenue bonds that require credit enhancements in addition to the real estate mortgages 
the bonds bear a floating interest rate  which currently averages and mature in guarantees of million will expire upon two industrial buildings becoming and leased 
currently  these buildings are and leased  respectively 
the remaining million in guarantees relate to loans on four office buildings that were in the lease up phase at the time the loans were initiated 
each of the loans will expire by may the average occupancy of the four buildings at december  is 
if the joint ventures are unable to repay the outstanding balance under the loans  we will be required  under the terms of the agreements  to repay the outstanding balance 
recourse provisions exist to enable us to recover some or all of our losses from the joint ventures assets and or the other partner 
the joint ventures currently generate sufficient cash flow to cover the debt service required by the loans 
in connection with the rrhwoods  llc joint venture  we renewed our guarantee of million to a bank in july the bank provides a letter of credit securing industrial revenue bonds  which mature in we would be required to perform under the guarantee should the joint venture be unable to repay the bonds

with respect to the plaza colonnade  llc joint venture  we have included million in other liabilities and adjusted the investment in unconsolidated affiliates by million on our consolidated balance sheet at december  related to two separate guarantees of a construction loan agreement and a construction completion agreement 
the construction loan matures in february  with two one year options to extend the maturity date that are conditional on completion and lease up of the project 
the term of the construction completion agreement requires the core and shell of the building to be completed by december  currently  the building is scheduled to be completed in december both guarantees arose from the formation of the joint venture to construct an office building 
if the joint venture is unable to repay the outstanding balance under the construction loan agreement or complete the construction of the office building  we would be required  under the terms of the agreements  to repay our share of the outstanding balance under the construction loan and complete the construction of the office building 
the maximum potential amount of future payments by us under these agreements is million 
no recourse provisions exist that would enable us to recover from the other partner amounts paid under the guarantee 
however  given that the loan is collateralized by the building  we and our partner could obtain and liquidate the building to recover the amounts paid should we be required to perform under the guarantee 
in addition to the plaza colonnade  llc construction loan and completion agreement described above  the partners have collectively provided million in letters of credit  million by us and million by our partner 
we and our partner would be held liable under the letter of credit agreements should the joint venture not complete construction of the building 
the letters of credit expire in december  no recourse provisions exist that would enable us to recover from the other partner amounts drawn under the letter of credit 
in december  we guaranteed our partner in mg hiw  llc joint venture  a minimum internal rate of return on million of their equity investment in the remaining assets of the joint venture the orlando assets

the properties were leased as of december  and were encumbered by million of floating rate debt with interest based on libor plus basis points  which has been assumed by the company 
at the closing of the transaction  the company paid its partner  miller global  million and the million letter of credit was cancelled 
the transaction implies a valuation ownership of million  which includes the properties and other net assets of the joint venture 

table of contents in january  we signed a letter of intent with kapital consult  manager for dreilander fonds  a european investment firm  under which kapital consult will acquire a equity interest in the orlando properties for approximately million  excluding certain development rights to be retained by us 
although the transaction is subject to documentation and other closing conditions  it is expected to close no later than the end of the second quarter of as part of the mg hiw  llc acquisition on july   we entered into an option agreement with our partner  miller global  to acquire their interest in the assets of mg hiw metrowest i  llc and mg hiw metrowest ii  llc for million 
the million construction loan to fund the development of this property  of which million is outstanding at december   will be either paid in full or assumed by us in connection with the acquisition of the remaining assets 
we have guaranteed of the construction loan  such that if the joint venture is unable to repay the outstanding balance  we would be required  under the terms of the agreement  to repay of the outstanding balance

our partner in sf hiw harborview  lp has the right to put its equity interest in the partnership to us in cash at anytime during the one year period commencing on september  as a result  we have deferred a gain of million until the expiration of the put option 
the value of the equity interest will be determined based upon the then fair market value of sf hiw harborview  lp assets and liabilities 
interest rate hedging activities to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our revolving loan bears interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of long term financings and the unsecured issuance of debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
the following table sets forth information regarding our interest rate hedge contracts as of december  in thousands type of hedge notional amount maturity date reference rate fixed rate fair market value interest rate swap  month usd libor bba interest rate swap  month usd libor bba the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt is adjusted at one and three month intervals  subject to settlements under these contracts

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  however  certain of our significant accounting policies contain an increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the company s independent auditors 
we consider our critical accounting estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following real estate assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  and property operating expense recoveries real estate assets expenditures directly related to the development and construction of real estate assets are included in net real estate assets at cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
expenditures directly related to the leasing of properties are included in other assets at cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
with regard to the general and administrative costs  including compensation  we annually calculate the capitalization percentages which are based on employee hours allocated to successful efforts in development  construction and leasing  and adjust the financial statements to reflect any change in those allocations 
if those allocations prove to be incorrect  the resulting adjustments could impact earnings 
development expenditures include pre construction costs essential to the development of properties  development and construction costs  real estate taxes  interest costs  compensation and other costs incurred during the period of development 
the interest costs are capitalized at the building s vacancy percentage until either the building reaches occupancy or one year after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy  whichever occurs first 
the compensation costs are capitalized based on the capitalization percentage described above related to development activities 
construction expenditures include all general and administrative costs  including compensation and are capitalized based on the capitalization percentage related to specific construction projects 
the leasing expenditures include all general and administrative costs  including compensation and are capitalized based on the capitalization percentage related to successfully securing leases on the properties 
estimated costs related to unsuccessful development and leasing as well as estimated costs related to non specific construction projects are expensed as incurred 
all capitalizable costs related to the improvement or replacement of commercial real estate properties are capitalized 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings  years for building improvements and five to seven years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
if these estimated lives are too short or too long  future adjustments to depreciation expense may be required 
tenant improvements are amortized over the life of the respective leases  using the straight line method 
real estate assets are stated at the lower of cost or fair value  if impaired 

table of contents upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible assets such as land  buildings and tenant improvements  intangible assets such as above and below market leases  acquired in place leases and other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their relative fair values 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and or capitalization rates  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
above and below market leases acquired are recorded at their fair value 
fair value is calculated as the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired and measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of based rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to based rental revenue over the remaining term of the respective leases 
the value of in place leases is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  current market conditions  and cost to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider tenant improvements  leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
the value of in place leases are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
if a tenant vacates its space prior to its contractual expiration date  any unamortized balance of their related intangible asset is expensed 
the value of tenant relationships is based on our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
factors considered include the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
the value of tenant relationships is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods defined in the respective leases 
based on our acquisitions to date  we have deemed relationships to be immaterial and have not allocated any amounts to this intangible asset 
real estate and leasehold improvements are classified as long lived assets held for sale or as long lived assets to be held and used 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value 
fair value is equal to the estimated or contracted sales price with a potential buyer less cost to sell 
the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  if events or changes in circumstances  such as significant decline in occupancy and change in use  indicate that the carrying value may be impaired  we perform an impairment analysis 
such analysis consists of determining whether the asset s carrying amount will be recovered from its undiscounted estimated future operating cash flows 
these cash flows are estimates based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates and costs to operate each property 
if the carrying amount of a held and used asset exceeds the sum of its undiscounted future operating cash flows  an impairment loss would be recorded for the difference between the discounted cash flows and the net book value 
as the factors used in generating these cash flows are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions  the undiscounted future operating cash flows estimated by us in our impairment analyses may not be achieved and we may be required to recognize future impairment losses on our properties 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
the evaluation primarily consists of reviewing past due account balances and considering such factors as the credit quality of our tenants  historical trends of the tenant and or other debtor  current economic conditions and changes in customer payment terms 
additionally  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  we estimate the expected recovery through bankruptcy claims and increase the allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible 
if our assumptions regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable prove incorrect  we could experience write offs of accounts receivable or accrued straight line rents receivable in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
property operating expense recoveries property operating cost recoveries from tenants or cost reimbursements are determined on a lease by lease basis 
the most common types of cost reimbursements in our leases are common area maintenance cam and real estate taxes  where the tenant pays its pro rata share of operating and administrative expenses and real estate taxes 
the computation of cost reimbursements from tenants for cam and real estate taxes is complex and involves numerous judgements including interpretation of terms and other tenant lease provisions 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are hundreds of variations in the computations dealing with such matters as which costs are includable or not includable for reimbursement  what is the square footage of the overall property space to determine the pro rata percentages  and the applicability of cost limitation provisions  among other things 
most tenants make monthly fixed payments of cam  real estate taxes and other cost reimbursement items 
we record these payments as income each month 
we also make adjustments  positive or negative  to cost recovery income to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements 
after the end of the calendar year  we compute each tenant s final cost reimbursements and issue a bill or credit for the full amount  after considering amounts paid by the tenants during the year 
the differences between the amounts billed  less previously received payments and the accrual adjustment are recorded as increases or decreases to cost recovery income when the final bills are prepared  usually beginning in march and completed by june or july 
the net amounts of any such adjustments have not been material in any of the years ended december  and final adjustments for the year ended december  have not yet been determined 

table of contents funds from operations and cash available for distribution we believe that funds from operations ffo is one of several indicators of the performance of an equity reit 
ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits because it excludes factors  such as depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate assets  which are based on historical cost and may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance 
ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo as described below 
cash available for distribution cad is another useful financial performance measure of an equity reit 
cad provides an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt  fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and pay distributions 
cad does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs 
ffo and cad are non gaap financial measures and do not represent net income or cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
our calculation of ffo  which we believe is consistent with the calculation of ffo as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is as follows net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  less gains or plus losses from sales of depreciable operating properties  excluding impairment losses see note following the table and items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus minority interest  less dividends to preferred shareholders  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis  and plus or minus adjustments for depreciation and amortization  gain loss on sale and minority interest related to discontinued operations 
cad is defined as ffo reduced by non revenue enhancing capital expenditures for building improvements and tenant improvements and lease commissions related to second generation space 
in addition  cad includes both recurring and nonrecurring operating results

table of contents in connection with the sec s adoption of regulation g  which governs the presentation of non gaap financial measures in documents filed with the sec  we revised our definition of ffo for and all periods presented relating to the add back of non real estate depreciation and amortization 
our revised definition is in accordance with the definition provided by nareit 
the change reduced ffo before amounts allocable to minority interest by million or per share for the fourth quarter of and by million or per share for the fourth quarter of for the full year  the impact was million  or per share  and for the full year  the impact was million or per share 
in october  nareit issued a financial reporting alert that changed its current implementation guidance for ffo regarding impairment losses 
accordingly  impairment losses related to depreciable assets have now been included in ffo for the periods presented 
the following is a reconciliation of gain loss on disposition of depreciable real estate assets included in the ffo calculation and gain loss on disposition of depreciable assets included in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and continuing operations gain on disposition of depreciable real estate assets per ffo calculation impairment losses gain on disposition and impairment of depreciable assets  net per consolidated statements of income discontinued operations gain on disposition of depreciable real estate assets per ffo calculation impairment losses gain on disposition and impairment of depreciable assets  net per consolidated statements of income in addition to the impairment losses detailed above  ffo for the year ended december  also includes a million impairment loss included in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates related to the acquisition of certain assets of the mg hiw  llc joint venture by the company 
as a result of fasb s rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas  losses on the extinguishment of debt are no longer classified as an extraordinary item in our consolidated statements of income 
therefore  the calculation of ffo no longer includes an add back of this amount 
ffo before amounts allocable to minority interest from the operating partnership for the year ended december  was decreased by million  which represents a loss on the extinguishment of debt incurred during those periods 
there were no losses on the extinguishment of debt incurred in as a result of the changes to the ffo calculation as outlined in footnotes  and  ffo has been reduced by the following in dollars and per share amounts ffo in dollars before amounts allocable to minority interest from the operating partnership ffo per share for further discussion related to discontinued operations  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
assumes redemption of common units for shares of common stock 
minority interest common unit holders and the stockholders of the company share equally on a per common unit and per share basis  therefore  the per share information is unaffected by conversion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below 
our market risk discussion includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 

table of contents to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our two revolving loans bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding that was not protected by interest rate hedge contracts 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt is basis points higher or lower during the months ended december   our interest expense would be increased or decreased approximately million 
for a discussion of our interest rate hedge contracts in effect at december  see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations liquidity and capital resources interest rate hedging activities 
if interest rates increase by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of these interest rate hedge contracts as of december  would increase by approximately million 
if interest rates decrease by basis points  the aggregate fair market value of these interest rate hedge contracts as of december  would decrease by approximately million 
in addition  we are exposed to certain losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties under the hedge contracts 
we expect the counter parties  which are major financial institutions  to perform fully under the contracts 
however  if either of the counter parties was to default on its obligation under an interest rate hedge contract  we could be required to pay the full rates on our debt  even if such rates were in excess of the rate in the contract
