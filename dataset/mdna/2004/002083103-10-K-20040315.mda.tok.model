item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we manufacture and market a mechanical bileaflet heart valve with a patented pivot design 
our heart valve is used to treat valvular heart disease caused by the natural aging process  rheumatic heart disease and congenital defects 
sulzer carbomedics carbomedics developed the basic design from which the ats heart valve evolved 
carbomedics is a large and experienced manufacturer of pyrolytic carbon components used in mechanical heart valves 
carbomedics has also designed and patented numerous mechanical valves 
carbomedics offered to license a patented and partially developed valve to us if we would complete the development of the valve and agree to purchase carbon components from carbomedics 
we hold an exclusive  royalty free  worldwide license to an open pivot  bileaflet mechanical heart valve design owned by carbomedics from which the ats heart valve has evolved 
in addition  we have an exclusive  worldwide right and license to use carbomedics pyrolytic carbon technology to manufacture components for the ats heart valve 
we commenced selling the ats heart valve in international markets in in october  we received fda approval to sell the ats open pivot r mhv and commenced sales and marketing of our valve in the united states 
the original sales forecasts as well as the pricing models that were used when the original supply agreement was signed with carbomedics proved to be too optimistic 
accordingly  to keep the supply agreement active and the license to sell the valve exclusive  we purchased quantities of inventory far in excess of demand 
from through  we paid carbomedics approximately million for the development of our valve  the technology to manufacture our pyrolytic carbon components  and for pyrolytic valve components manufactured by carbomedics 
on december   we had remaining payments due under the technology agreement that totaled million 
this led us in to negotiate an accelerated but reduced payment for all outstanding debts to carbomedics related to the technology agreement 
in august we paid million to satisfy all future obligations under this agreement 
with inventory purchases exceeding sales through the years  we have built inventory levels that today provide a source of cash 
we are drawing down these paid for inventories and using the cash it generates to fund operations 
our manufacturing facility for pyrolytic carbon components has been producing limited quantities 
we expect to increase production in this facility sometime in but are carefully considering our options as this decision will require the use of cash as we buy raw materials and hire production workers 
in june  we reorganized the company laying off more than half of the work force including all executive management 
with the hiring of a new president late in  we have started the process of rebuilding our sales and marketing teams  especially in the united states 
this rebuilding is the most significant factor in our expense level during because sales prices in the united states exceed selling prices elsewhere  we feel that our future success will depend on achieving increased market share in the us our us sales as a percentage of our overall sales have grown from in to in critical accounting policies and estimates we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our estimates  including but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and income taxes 
the critical accounting policies that are most important in fully understanding and evaluating the financial condition and results of operations are discussed below 
revenue recognition policy 
a significant portion of our revenue in the united states  canada  and france is generated from consigned inventory maintained at hospitals or with field representatives 
in these situations  revenue is recognized at the time that the product has been implanted or used 
in all other instances  revenue is recognized at the time product is shipped 
certain independent distributors in select international markets receive rebates against invoiced sales amounts 
in these situations  we accrue for these rebates at the time of the original sale 
the total of these accrued rebates was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that is calculated using subjective judgments and estimates to establish this valuation account 
our distribution in international markets through independent distributors concentrates relatively large amounts of receivables in relatively few customer accounts 
we have successfully done business with most of these distributors for many years 
we monitor amounts that are not paid according to terms 
we attempt to accrue for potential losses due to non payment 
financial conditions in international markets can change very quickly and our allowance for doubtful accounts cannot anticipate all potential changes 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  compared to million in as a percentage of total accounts receivable  the allowance was on december  and in this reduction in allowance is due to the collection of one account that had been classified as doubtful in previous accounting periods 
inventory valuation 
inventories are recorded at the lower of manufacturing cost or net realizable value 
we have historically had manufacturing costs exceeding net realizable values in certain international markets requiring us to write down certain inventories to expected selling prices due to high purchase prices of pyrolytic valve components under our supply agreement with carbomedics 
this lower of cost or market adjustment is charged to cost of sales and is calculated by estimating future selling volume and prices by market and comparing this to actual inventory levels  both finished goods and work in process 
an adjustment is made in those cases where our manufacturing costs are or will be greater than our eventual selling price 
if our estimates of future selling prices or volumes prove incorrect  future adjustments to inventory carrying values would be necessary and could have a material impact on operations 
lower of cost or market adjustments were million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
we believe that future manufacturing costs will be lower as we manufacture our own pyrolytic carbon components 
this should decrease the risk of these adjustments as current inventories are depleted 
we maintain an obsolescence allowance against certain raw material inventory items used in our valve assembly manufacturing process 
this allowance totals million at december  and a portion of inventories on hand at december  and are not likely to be sold in the following twelve months periods and therefore are not classified as a current asset 
the estimate of inventories necessary to support current sales includes our projections not only of sales but inventories for new consignment accounts and contingencies 
accordingly  these amounts are classified as a current asset 
long term assets technology license 
we assess the carrying value of our technology license annually in accordance with the provisions of fas statement fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the assessment of potential impairment requires certain judgments and estimates  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by the asset  risks associated with those cash flows  and the discount rate to be utilized 
as of december   we believe that the carrying value of our technology license is recoverable and no impairment charge is currently necessary 
deferred tax assets 
we have incurred tax losses of approximately million 
the losses are carried forward for u 
s 
and state corporate income taxes and can be used to reduce future taxes 
at december  we had deferred tax assets totaling million 
we have taken a valuation allowance against this asset for its full amount because the carryforwards have a limited life and other limitations 
an alternative accounting judgment would be to record the entire asset on our balance sheet and in subsequent periods  if it became apparent that a portion of the asset would not be realized  write it off against income in that period 
in order to utilize that treatment we would have to decide that it was more likely than not that we would realize the deferred tax assets and credits 
results of operations the following table provides the dollar and percentage change in our statements of operations for compared to and compared to year ended december  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease net sales       cost of sales       gross profit   operating expenses sales and marketing       research and development      general and administrative      impairment of technology license     reorganization expense     distributor termination expenses gain on extinguishment of debt   total operating expenses       operating loss       interest income expense   net loss       the following table presents the statement of operations as a percentage of sales for   and year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative impairment of technology license reorganization expense distributor termination expenses gain on extinguishment of debt total operating expenses operating loss interest income expense net loss net sales 
the following tables compare net sales during   and year ended december  increase increase in thousands decrease decrease united states      outside united states       total       change in change in average average sales unit sales unit price sales total price sales total united states outside united states total year ended december  share of total sales united states outside united states total in june  the majority of our us sales persons were terminated 
in the fourth quarter of  we hired a new ceo and began building our new sales organization in the us consisting of four area directors managing sales territories 
our representation within these territories now consists of both direct sales representatives and independent agents 
this new sales organization and overall greater sales efforts contributed to our increase in sales in as compared to and to our sales within the us accounting for a larger percentage of overall sales 
during we aggressively entered several international markets that represented opportunities for greater sales unit growth but at prices lower than our other markets 
prices in some of these territories are lower than our current manufacturing costs 
we feel this strategy is reasonable because if allows us to increase our market share while reducing our high priced but paid for inventories 
once we have exhausted our high priced components  we expect to have lower manufacturing costs per valve which will allow us to realize gross profit in these international markets 
cost of goods sold 
we have made write downs to our inventories the past three years due to future selling prices being lower than manufacturing costs in select international markets 
following is a summary of our cost of goods sold divided between sales of products and lower of cost or market adjustments 
year ended december  in thousands cost of goods sold  as reported    less cost of good sold related to a lower of cost or market adjustment    cost of goods sold related to product sales    cost of good sold related to product sales as a percentage of net sales our costs of goods sold as a percentage of net sales has varied due to changes in average selling price 
our gross margin is anticipated to improve as sales within the unites states increase as a percentage of total sales and as we start selling valves that have been entirely manufactured in our facilities 
our inventories of high priced carbon components currently exceed our expected sales during the ats valve is made of materials that do not deteriorate 
other than the need to resterilize them periodically  there is no risk of perishability 
pyrolytic carbon  which is the substrate used in manufacturing our valves  has been the only material used to manufacture mechanical heart valves for humans for many years and remains the most advanced raw material for our products 
the other sources of prosthetic heart valves for humans are cadaver and porcine tissues  however  obsolescence issue because of this are remote because of certain advantages offered by mechanical heart valves including superior durability 
similarly  we believe that  given the lead time that would be required  there is no material risk that there would be the introduction and fda approval of another substrate that would replace pyrolytic carbon prior to the end of the period over which we expect to sell our inventory of valves 
sales and marketing 
cost increases in over were for the building of our new sales and marketing organizations 
in june  the majority of our us sales persons were terminated resulting in a substantial decrease in expenses during compared to in the fourth quarter of  we hired a new ceo and thereafter began the process of hiring and training the new employees in the new sales and marketing organizations 
we have substantially completed the hiring and training of our new sales and marketing organizations 
research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs to develop and improve current and future products  the costs for regulatory and clinical activities for these products  and the costs to set up and maintain our carbon components manufacturing facility while it is in pre production mode 
the operational qualification and validation of the carbon production equipment and making pilot coating runs have been charged to research and development costs 
the following table compares the different components of research and development costs for   and year ended december  in thousands costs related to manufacturing facility    all other r d costs total    on may   we received notification from the fda of full approval of our carbon manufacturing facility 
the decrease in research and development expenses during is attributable to the costs of setting up and qualifying our manufacturing facility to receive this approval during the first half of we expect to increase production capacity of our carbon components during accordingly  the costs of this facility that are now classified as research and development costs will be included as costs of goods sold after the date on which we commence increased production of these carbon components 
general and administrative 
during  we incurred legal  accounting  and other professional services substantially for legal support  recruitment  and the hiring of our new executive team that totaled million 
in addition  management bonus accruals increased by million  for management s attainment of increased financial performance 
the decrease in expenses during compared to is due to fewer personnel as a result of certain reorganization initiatives during the second half of impairment charge 
during the first quarter of  we evaluated the carrying value of its technology license asset of million in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
while this evaluation indicated that the asset s carrying value was recoverable  changes in sales volumes and selling prices during the second quarter of necessitated a revaluation of the recoverability of that asset 
as a result of this updated cash flow analysis  we recorded an million non cash charge during the second quarter of we believe our current carrying value of the technology license is recoverable and no further impairment charges have been taken 
distributor termination expenses 
during the fourth quarter of  we terminated our relationship with our distributor who covered france and belgium because of violations of several conditions of the distributor agreement 
the distributor had the right to return its inventory of valves to us as a result of the early termination clause within the distributor agreement 
we accrued an estimated termination charge of million  representing the margin on the valves that were expected to be returned and the estimated cost related to restocking such inventory for resale 
the entire charge was paid for in reorganization expense 
in june  the board of directors decided to significantly decrease our workforce 
as part of these cost reduction measures  one half of the workforce  including the executive officers of the company  were released from employment 
a charge of million was recorded as reorganization expense at that time 
gain on extinguishment of debt 
on july   we entered into an agreement and on august   we paid centerpulse usa holdings co 
centerpulse million in exchange for cancellation of all of our payment obligations under our carbon technology agreement and after which we would own a fully paid exclusive license to use the carbon technology to produce components for our valve 
prior to this agreement  we were obligated to pay centerpulse an aggregate of million under the technology agreement over a period of approximately four years 
these payments were accrued as milestones were met 
of the total million  there were two uncompleted milestones totaling million that were not accrued 
since the amount accrued exceeded the amount we paid  we realized a non cash gain on the extinguishment of debt in the amount of million on this transaction 
net interest income expense 
our interest expense was primarily attributable to imputed interest on our long term debt previously owed to centerpulse 
our interest income is primarily attributable to the investment of our cash balances 
income taxes 
we have accumulated approximately million of net operating loss nol carryforwards for us tax purposes 
we believe that our ability to fully utilize the existing nol carryforwards could be restricted on a portion of the nol for changes in control that may have occurred or may occur in the future 
we have not conducted a formal study of whether a change in control of ats has occurred in the past that impairs our nol carryforwards because we are unable to utilize such nol carryforwards until we achieve profitability and because this study would be very expensive to complete 
when we attain profitability  we will conduct a formal study of any restrictions on our carryforwards 
we have not recorded any net assets related to our nol carryforwards and other deferred items as we currently cannot determine that it is reasonably likely that this asset will be realized and we  therefore  have provided a valuation allowance for the entire asset 
net loss 
our decrease in net loss in compared to and the increase in net loss in compared to resulted from changes in sales offset by changes in operating costs  all of which are described above 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled million and million on december  and december   respectively 
operating activities 
during we received cash payments from customers of million 
we made cash payments to employees and suppliers of million 
our operating loss during of million was substantially funded through the depletion of inventories 
during  we incurred significant expenses commercializing the ats heart valve in the united states 
as we build sales in future periods and our cost of inventories decrease  our operating losses will decrease and we will move steadily towards a cash flow breakeven on sales and eventually to profitability 
we believe our current cash balances are adequate to fund our operating activities during investing and financing activities 
we historically have funded our operations through equity investments 
during  we raised million through an equity offering and the issuance of stock through the exercise of stock options 
during  we paid million of debt related to our carbon technology agreement 
we have no future payment obligations under this agreement 
during we purchased property and equipment totaling million 
our current level of property and equipment is adequate to support operations in and purchases of equipment will approximate spending in cash management during and into  we expect to increase production of pyrolytic carbon components in our own factory 
this will require the use of cash as we purchase raw materials and hire employees to make the inventory 
current inventory levels are adequate into we estimate that operating costs will remain high in comparison to sales during and and will require the use of cash to fund operations 
we will draw down cash balances to build inventories and fund operations during and based upon the current forecast of sales and operating expenses  we anticipate having cash to fund our operations through however  as identified under the heading of cautionary statements below  any adverse change that affects our revenue  access to the capital markets or future demand for our products will affect our long term viability 
maintaining adequate levels of working capital depends in part upon the success of our products in the marketplace  the relative profitability of those products and our ability to control operating and capital expenses 
funding of our operations in future periods may require additional investments in ats in the form of equity or debt 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve desired levels of sales or profitability  or that future capital infusions will be available 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in item of regulation s k that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future payment obligations 
payments due by period less one to four to more than than three five five thousands total one year years years years operating leases   purchase obligations     total     cautionary statements this document contains forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws that may include statements regarding intent  belief or current expectations of our company and our management 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those statements are identified as forward looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the statement 
we desire to take advantage of these safe harbor provisions 
accordingly  we hereby identify the following important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from any such results which may be projected  forecast  estimated or budgeted by us in forward looking statements made by us from time to time in reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications  or in oral forward looking statements made from time to time by the company s officers and agents 
we do not intend to update any of these forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform them to actual results 
if our heart valve does not achieve widespread market acceptance in the united states  our operating results will be harmed and we may not achieve profitability 
our success will depend  in large part  on the medical community s acceptance of the ats heart valve in the united sates  which is the largest revenue market in the world for heart valves 
the us medical community s acceptance of the ats heart valve will depend upon our ability to demonstrate the safety and efficacy  advantages  long term clinical performance and cost effectiveness of the ats heart valve as compared to other prosthetic heart valves 
we cannot predict whether the us medical community will accept the ats heart valve or  if accepted  the extent of its use 
negative publicity resulting from isolated incidents involving the ats heart valve or other prosthetic heart valves could have a significant adverse effect on the overall acceptance of our heart valve 
if we encounter difficulties developing a market for the ats heart valve in the united states  we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to achieve profitability and our business and results of operations will be seriously harmed 
we currently rely on the ats heart valve as our sole source of revenue 
if we are not successful in selling this product  our operating results will be harmed 
we have developed only one product  which is currently being sold primarily outside the united states 
even if we were to develop additional products  regulatory approval would likely be required to sell them 
clinical testing and the approval process itself are very expensive and can take many years 
therefore  we do not expect to be in a position to sell additional products in the foreseeable future 
adverse rulings by regulatory authorities  product liability lawsuits  the failure to achieve widespread us market acceptance  the loss of market acceptance outside of the united states  or other adverse publicity may significantly and adversely affect our sales of the ats heart valve  and  as a result  would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in we began using a combination of direct sales persons and independent manufacturing representatives to sell our valves in the united states 
if our new us sales strategy is not successful  we will not be able to continue our operations as planned 
our sales approach for the sale of the ats valve in the united states consists primarily of direct salespersons with a few independent manufacturer s representatives 
we will need to continue to expend significant funds and management resources to develop and maintain this hybrid sales force 
we believe there is significant competition for sales personnel and independent manufacturing representatives with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need 
if we are unable to recruit  retain and motivate qualified personnel and representatives  us sales of the ats valve could be adversely affected 
the loss of key salespersons or independent manufacturer s representatives could have a material adverse effect on our sales or potential sales to current customers and prospects serviced by such salespersons or representatives 
further  we cannot assure the successful expansion of our network of independent manufacturer s representatives on terms acceptable to ats  if at all  or the successful marketing of our products by our hybrid sales force 
to the extent we rely on sales through independent manufacturer s representatives  any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of these parties 
we do not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that these third parties devote to our product 
if our us sales strategy is not successful  we may be forced to change our us sales strategy again 
any such change could disrupt sales in the united states 
further  any change in our us sales strategy could be expensive and would likely have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we currently depend on the marketing and sales efforts of international independent distributors  and our sales have been concentrated in three countries 
the ats heart valve is sold internationally through independent distributors 
the loss of an international distributor could seriously harm our business and results of operations if a new distributor could not be found on a timely basis in the relevant geographic market 
we do not control the amount and timing of marketing resources that these third parties devote to our product 
furthermore  to the extent we rely on sales through independent distributors  any revenues we receive will depend primarily on the efforts of these parties 
we are dependent upon sales outside the united states  which are subject to a number of risks including a drop in sales due to currency fluctuations 
as december   of our net sales are derived from international operations 
we expect that international sales will account for a substantial majority of our revenue until the ats heart valve receives wider market acceptance from us customers 
accordingly  any material decrease in foreign sales may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
we sell in us dollars to most of our customers abroad 
an increase in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies can and has adversely affected our sales outside of the united states 
in prior years  the decrease in sales was due primarily to the change in the value of the us dollar against the euro  as well as competitor price pressure 
our dependence on sales outside of the united states will continue to expose us to us dollar currency fluctuations for the foreseeable future 
our future results of operations could also be harmed by risks inherent in doing business in international markets  including unforeseen changes in regulatory requirements and government health programs  weaker intellectual property rights protection in some countries  new export license requirements  changes in tariffs or trade restrictions  political and economic instability in our target markets  and greater difficulty in collecting payments from product sales 
in  we experienced a slow collection of receivables from our italian distributor 
as a result  we ceased recognizing sales to this distributor upon shipment  and instead recognize sales to this distributor only upon receipt of payment 
slow payment of receivables by other international distributors  or the occurrence of any of the other factors listed above  could harm our ability to successfully commercialize our product internationally and could harm our business 
we have a history of net losses 
if we do not have net income in the future  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we are not currently profitable and have a very limited history of profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant expenses over the next several years as we continue to devote substantial resources to the commercialization of the ats heart valve in the united states 
we will not generate net income unless we are able to significantly increase revenue from us sales 
if we continue to sustain losses  we may not be able to continue our business as planned 
we changed management in late our failure to retain the current management or our management s failure to improve sales and achieve profitability could adversely impact our results of operations 
in october we hired a new president and chief executive officer 
since then  we have hired the rest of our current executive team 
most of the members of our executive team have extensive experience in sales and marketing medical device products 
there is substantial competition for executives with this kind of experience 
therefore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our management team 
replacing our management team could substantially disrupt our prospects  business and operations 
further  the failure of the current management team to substantially increase sales and return the company to profitability could negatively affect our continued ability to sell products to existing customers 
the market for prosthetic heart valves is highly competitive  and a number of our competitors are larger and have more financial resources 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
the market for prosthetic heart valves is highly competitive 
we expect that competition will intensify as additional companies enter the market or modify their existing products to compete directly with us 
our primary competitor  st 
jude medical  inc  currently controls approximately of the worldwide mechanical heart valve market 
many of our competitors have long standing fda approval for their valves and extensive clinical data demonstrating the performance of their valves 
in addition  they have greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and research and development capabilities than we have 
for example  many of our competitors have the ability  due to their internal carbon manufacturing facilities and economies of scale  to manufacture their heart valves at a lower cost than we can manufacture our ats heart valve 
our primary competitor has recently used price as a method to compete in several international markets 
if heart valve prices decline significantly we might not be able to compete successfully  which would harm our results of operations 
our future results will be harmed if the use of mechanical heart valves declines 
our business could suffer if the use of mechanical heart valves declines 
historically  mechanical heart valves have accounted for over two thirds of all heart valve replacements 
recently  there has been an increase in the use of tissue valves 
we estimate that mechanical heart valves are currently being used in to of all heart valve replacements  depending on the geographic market  down from to about ten years ago 
we believe the tissue manufacturers claims of improvements in tissue valve longevity and an increase in the average age of valve patients have contributed to the recent increase in the use of tissue valves 
new products or technologies developed by others could render our product obsolete 
the medical device industry is characterized by significant technological advances 
several companies are developing new prosthetic heart valves based on new or potentially improved technologies 
significant advances are also being made in surgical procedures  which may delay the need for replacement heart valves 
a new product or technology may emerge that renders the ats heart valve noncompetitive or obsolete 
this could materially harm our results of operations or force us to cease doing business altogether 
we maintain a large volume of inventory  which exceeds the current demand for the ats heart valve 
if sales of our product do not increase  the value of our inventory could decrease substantially 
we purchased pyrolytic carbon components under a long term supply agreement with carbomedics  inc formerly sulzer carbomedics  inc 
through june and we are required to resume purchases of such components in to date  our purchases of pyrolytic carbon components have exceeded our sales of the ats heart valves 
we currently have in inventory enough pyrolytic carbon components to satisfy our projected requirements through if we are unable to achieve widespread acceptance for the ats heart valve or if competitive pressures result in price reductions  the value of the excess inventory would likely decrease  which could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition 
because the pyrolytic carbon components are made to meet the unique specifications of the ats heart valve  our inventory may have little  if any  value in the open market 
we license patented technology and other proprietary rights from carbomedics 
if these agreements are breached or terminated  our right to manufacture the ats heart valve could be terminated 
under our carbon technology agreement with carbomedics  we have obtained a license to use carbomedics pyrolytic carbon technology to manufacture components for the ats heart valve 
if this agreement is breached or terminated  we would be unable to manufacture our own product 
if our inventory is exhausted and we do not have any other sources of carbon components  we would be forced to cease doing business 
a delay or interruption in the supply of pyrolytic carbon components could delay product delivery or force us to cease operations 
we cannot be certain that  after our current inventory is exhausted  sufficient quantities of pyrolytic carbon components will be available to assemble the ats heart valve 
other than our carbon facility  the only other fda approved alternate supplier of our pyrolytic carbon components is carbomedics 
although we have a supply agreement with carbomedics under which it agrees to supply us with a minimum annual number of pyrolytic carbon components in through  the amounts available under this agreement are not expected to be sufficient to supply all of our needs for components in those years 
if our inventory is exhausted and we are unable to manufacture carbon components or obtain them from other sources  we could be forced to reduce or cease operations 
because we lack manufacturing experience  we may not realize expected savings from manufacturing our own product 
in addition  we could experience production delays and significant additional costs 
under our agreement with carbomedics  we have been granted an exclusive worldwide license to manufacture pyrolytic carbon components for the ats heart valve 
we cannot be certain that our strategy to establish internal manufacturing capabilities will result in a cost effective means for manufacturing the ats heart valve 
we have limited experience in manufacturing pyrolytic carbon 
although we have an fda approved carbon manufacturing facility  it is currently operating at the minimal level necessary to maintain the plant and our technical expertise in producing carbon components 
in the future when we increase production at the plant we may encounter difficulties in maintaining and expanding our manufacturing operations  including problems involving production yields  quality control  per unit manufacturing costs  shortages of qualified personnel  and compliance with fda and international regulations and requirements regarding good manufacturing practices 
difficulties encountered by us in establishing or maintaining a commercial scale manufacturing facility may limit our ability to manufacture our heart valve and therefore could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
our business could be seriously harmed if third party payors do not reimburse the costs for our heart valve 
our ability to successfully commercialize the ats heart valve depends on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of our product and the related surgical procedure is available from third party payors  such as governmental programs  private insurance plans and managed care organizations 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and procedures that they consider are not cost effective or are used for a non approved indication 
the failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of our product to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors would seriously harm our business and results of operations 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the health care system in the united states 
some of these proposals have included measures that would limit or eliminate payment for medical procedures or treatments 
in addition  government and private third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement 
in international markets  reimbursement and health care payment systems vary significantly by country 
in addition  we have encountered price resistance from government administered health programs 
significant changes in the health care system in the united states or elsewhere  including changes resulting from adverse trends in third party reimbursement programs  could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may face product liability claims  which could result in losses in excess of our insurance coverage and which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
the manufacture and sale of mechanical heart valves entail significant risk of product liability claims and product recalls 
a mechanical heart valve is a life sustaining device and the failure of any mechanical heart valve usually results in the patient s death or need for reoperation 
a product liability claim or product recall  regardless of the ultimate outcome  could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages and could seriously harm our business 
we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage in an aggregate amount of million 
however  we cannot assure you that our current insurance coverage is adequate to cover the costs of any product liability claims made against us 
product liability insurance is expensive and does not cover the costs of a product recall 
in the future  product liability insurance may not be available at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
a product liability claim or product recall could also materially and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
our business would be adversely affected if we are not able to protect our intellectual property rights 
our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and enforce our patents and other proprietary rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  know how and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
these measures afford only limited protection and competitors may gain access to our intellectual property and proprietary information 
the patent positions of medical device companies are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and technical issues 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets and to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights 
any litigation could be costly and divert our attention from the growth of the business 
we cannot assure you that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be successfully challenged  or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent information and technology or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology 
we may be sued by third parties which claim that our product infringes on their intellectual property rights 
any such suits could result in significant litigation or licensing expenses or we might be prevented from selling our product 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on intellectual property infringement claims 
any claims or litigation against us  regardless of the merits  could result in substantial costs and could harm our business 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to cease manufacturing and selling our product  which would seriously harm us  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or redesign our product  which could be costly and time consuming 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which is costly  time consuming and can subject us to unanticipated delays 
the ats heart valve and our manufacturing activities are subject to extensive regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including the fda and comparable international agencies 
we are required to maintain the approval of the fda and international regulatory agencies to continue selling the ats heart valve  obtain the approval of international regulatory agencies in countries where the ats heart valve is not yet marketed  satisfy content requirements for all of our labeling  sales and promotional materials  comply with manufacturing and reporting requirements  and undergo rigorous inspections by these agencies 
compliance with the regulations of these agencies may delay or prevent us from introducing any new or improved products 
violations of regulatory requirements may result in fines  marketing restrictions  product recall  withdrawal of approvals and civil and criminal penalties 
the price of our common stock has been volatile  which may result in losses to investors 
the minimum bid price of our common stock was below per share during a ten month period beginning in and ending in march as a result  our common stock lost its eligibility to be traded on the nasdaq national market and instead was traded on the nasdaq smallcap market until july  when our common stock was relisted on the nasdaq national market after again meeting that market s eligibility criteria 
if the minimum bid price of our stock again falls below for an extended period of time  we may be forced to relist our stock on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our common stock fails to meet the eligibility criteria for continued listing on either the nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market  the price of our stock would  in all likelihood  decline  and our investors would find it more difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock 
historically  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuate in the future 
the market price of our common stock could be impacted by the following the success of our management in operating ats effectively  the failure of the ats valve to gain market acceptance in the united states  announcements of technical innovations or new products by our competitors  the status of component supply arrangements  changes in reimbursement policies  government regulation  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others  and general market conditions 
in addition  due to one or more of the foregoing factors  in future years  our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected 
finally  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating results 
our charter documents and minnesota law may discourage and could delay or prevent a takeover of our company 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and minnesota law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders 
these provisions include the following no cumulative voting by shareholders for directors  the ability of our board to set the size of the board of directors  to create new directorships and to fill vacancies  the ability of our board  without shareholder approval  to issue preferred stock  which may have rights and preferences that are superior to our common stock  the ability of our board to amend the bylaws  and restrictions under minnesota law on mergers or other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investments activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair market value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments may be invested in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  and both government and non government debt securities 
the average duration of all our investments has generally been less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
in the united states  canada  and france  we sell our products directly to hospitals 
in other international markets  we sell our products to independent distributors who  in turn  sell to medical hospitals 
loss  termination  or ineffectiveness of distributors to effectively promote our product would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
transactions with us and us customers and distributors  other than in france  are entered into in us dollars  precluding the need for foreign currency hedges on such sales 
sales through our french subsidiary  which was established in to replace a distributor  are in euros  so we are subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
we have not used foreign exchange contract or similar devices to reduce this risk 
we will evaluate the need to use foreign exchange contracts or similar devices  if sales in france increase substantially
