application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and service revenues and are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided fees are fixed and determinable  a customer purchase order is obtained when applicable  and collection is probable 
revenues from reseller agreements are recognized when the product is sold through to the end customer unless an established return history supports recognizing revenue upon shipment  less a provision for estimated sales returns 
deferred revenue consists of revenue from reseller arrangements and certain arrangements with extended payment terms 
revenue from extended payment terms is recognized in the period the payment becomes due if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue derived from the development and installation of highly customized software packages under a professional services contract is recognized on a percentage of completion basis measured by the relationship of hours worked to total estimated contract hours and the costs incurred as of the date of measurement 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of 
table of contents the revenue and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends upon estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition and net income  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and net income 
if estimates were to indicate that a loss would be incurred on a contract upon completion  a provision for the expected loss would be recorded in the period in which the loss became evident 
warranty reserve the company offers to its customers a limited warranty that its products will be free from defect in the materials and workmanship for a specified period 
the company has established a warranty reserve  as a component of accrued liabilities  for any potential claims 
the company estimates its warranty reserve based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
changes in claim rates and differences between actual and expected warranty costs could impact the warranty reserve estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts management is required to estimate the collectibility of the company s trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
management evaluates all accounts periodically and a reserve is established based on the best facts available to management and reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
the reserves also are determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories based on historical results 
allowance for returns the company estimates its allowance for returns based upon expected return rates 
the estimates of expected return rates are generally a factor of historical returns 
changes in return rates could impact allowance for return estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market involves an inherent level of risk and uncertainty due to technology trends in the industry and customer demand for our products 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
the company has experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions 
long lived assets property and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such determination is made in accordance with the applicable gaap requirements 
table of contents associated with the long lived asset  and is based upon  among other things  estimates of the amount of future net cash flows to be generated by the long lived asset and estimates of the current fair value of the asset

table of contents overview in the midst of the company s efforts to provide the telecommunications industry with the same high performance and reliability that interphase had traditionally delivered in enterprise network environments  the global telecommunications and computer networking industries  as a whole  significantly deteriorated in fiscal year and continued to decline through and much of the company s revenue and profitability were adversely impacted due to these market conditions as its target customers delayed or canceled projects while reducing resource levels through downsizing and layoffs 
in the longer term  we believe that these actions will enhance our ability to sell these customers our solutions 
over the past three years  we have worked closely with our customers to consider their needs and position our current and future product and services offerings 
we have also continued to manage our overall cost structure to keep our quarterly break even point at a low level

our gross margin has improved in each of the three years due to lower excess and obsolete inventory charges  improved product mix  improved manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in manufacturing overhead and material costs

it is difficult to predict our future margins based on the current economic and political environment and the condition of the telecommunications and computer industries  however  over the past year we have focused on design cost improvements  manufacturing costs and purchasing practices that we expect will enable us to remain price competitive and keep margin rates at levels in line with our pre trends if current forecasts are realized

the provisions of eitf issue are applicable on a prospective basis to transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the impact on our future results of operations and financial position depends on the terms and conditions of contracts  if any  which include elements of the eitf entered into or modified in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk the company is exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because it conducts business on a global basis and in some cases in foreign currencies 
the company s operations in france are measured in the local currency and converted into us dollars based on published exchange rates for the periods reported and are therefore subject to risk of exchange rate fluctuations

the company has no equity hedge contracts outstanding as of december  or december  interest rate risk the company s investments are subject to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that the company s financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected due to movements in interest rates 
the company invests its cash in a variety of interest earning financial instruments  including bank time deposits  money market funds  and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national governmental entities and agencies 
due to the demand nature of the company s money market funds and the short term nature of the company s time deposits and debt securities portfolio  these assets are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company manages this risk through investments with shorter term maturities and varying maturity dates 
if the company s short term assets were reinvested in a declining interest rate environment  the company would experience an immediate negative impact on interest income 
the opposite holds true in a rising interest rate environment
