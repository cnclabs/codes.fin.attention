critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue for finished products when the goods are shipped and title passes to the customer  provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exist  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is deemed probable 
deferred revenue we have sold extended warranty contracts covering a period of four to nine years beyond the one year basic guarantee 
the deferred revenue is recognized as income over the four to nine year period on a straight line basis commencing one year from the sale of the contracts 
intangible assets and goodwill we account for intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was adopted by we on february  in accordance with that statement  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but rather tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives  consisting of patents  trademarks  and rights  are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of to years  and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
for the year  goodwill was amortized using the straight line method  over a period of years 
goodwill and intangible assets with definite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income or discounted cash flows approach and the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
any impairment loss would be expensed in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the impairment test for intangibles with indefinite useful lives consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets with its carrying amount 
when the carrying amount of the intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference 
intangible assets with estimable lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or assets group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas recoverability of intangible assets with estimable lives and other long lived assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an assets or asset group to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the assets or asset group 
if these comparisons indicated that an asset is not recoverable  the impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or the asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we will be required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process will involve estimates of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for tax and accounting purposes
