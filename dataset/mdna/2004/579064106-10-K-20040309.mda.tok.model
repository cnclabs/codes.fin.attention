overview and executive summary we are a leading supplier of computer security solutions designed to prevent intrusions on networks and protect computer systems from the next generation of blended attacks and threats 
we offer two families of products  mcafee system protection solutions and mcafee network protection solutions 
our computer security solutions are offered primarily to large enterprises  governments  small and medium sized business and consumer users 
we derive our revenue and generate cash from customers from primarily two sources i product revenue  which includes software license  hardware and royalty revenue  and ii services and support revenue  which includes software license maintenance  training  consulting and on line subscription arrangements revenue 
for and  our net revenue was million and  million  and our net income was million and million 
our net revenue is impacted by corporate  government and consumer spending levels 
during the past three years  we have experienced softness in corporate level spending  with many of our customers delaying or permanently postponing technology solution implementations 
in addition to total net revenue and net income  in evaluating our business  management considers  among many other factors  the following sales by geography 
we operate our business in five geographic regions north america us and canada  europe  middle east and africa  or emea  japan  asia pacific and latin america 
in  of our net revenue was generated outside of north america  with north america and emea collectively accounting for of our total net revenue 
our sales in emea totaling million were favorably impacted by the strengthening of the euro and the british pound during the year 
north america and emea have experienced many of the same economic trends 

table of contents sales by product and customer category mcafee 
our mcafee products include enterprise  small and medium sized businesses and consumer products  with enterprise including our entercept host based intrusion protection products that were acquired in connection with the entercept acquisition in while sales to enterprises and small and medium sized businesses have been down  we have experienced significant growth in the consumer market 
from to  we experienced growth in our consumer anti virus business and our on line subscription arrangements revenue grew 
in  we added million net new subscribers to our mcafee 
com on line subscription service and at year end had a total subscriber base of approximately million customers 
our mcafee asap on line service is targeted at small and medium sized businesses and has approximately million subscribers at the end of drivers of this subscriber growth include numerous virus outbreaks in  including slammer and lovesan blaster and strategic relationships with oems and others  such as aol  dell and msn 
intrushield 
our intrushield network protection products  acquired by us in the second quarter of  are sold primarily to enterprises and small and medium sized businesses 
during  we saw sales grow to approximately million in the fourth quarter of  with approximately new customers added to our intrushield customer base in the quarter 
sniffer technologies 
our sniffer business has been impacted by the softness in corporate spending in and into we saw our sniffer revenues decrease from to  however  we did begin to see a rebound in the fourth quarter of  with sniffer revenues up over the prior quarter 
we saw our newest sniffer products performing very well in the quarter with approximately of sniffer sales being derived from products less than one year old 
magic 
we recently sold the assets of our magic solutions service desk business to bmc software  inc the sale closed on january  and we received cash proceeds of approximately million  subject to final purchase price adjustments 
during  and  net revenue from the sale of magic solutions products totaled approximately million  million and million respectively 
the loss of future magic revenues may increase our operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
deferred revenue balances 
our deferred revenue balance at december  was million  of which approximately million relates to our magic business 
we believe that the deferred revenue balance improves predictability of future revenues 
in the middle of  we introduced our perpetual plus licensing program in emea and are introducing this program in the united states in the first quarter of under the perpetual plus licensing program more revenue is allocated to service and support  therefore increasing the deferred revenue balance 
cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
cash  cash equivalents and investment balances at december  and totaled million and billion 
during  we generated approximately million in cash from operations  used million of cash for investing activities and used million of cash for financing activities 
our primary utilization of cash in was to retire zero coupon debentures  make acquisitions and provide for settlement of a securities class action lawsuit commenced against us in in  our management is focused  on among other things  i continuing to build on the current momentum in the consumer market and to grow faster than the competition in the consumer space  ii increasing revenue from the small to medium sized business customers by improving our channel distribution relationships  iii continuing to take the steps to make sniffer more profitable and cash flow positive  iv implementing cost controls and business streamlining measures required to improve operating margins  and v continuing to grow our intrusion prevention business 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ  and could be material  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we have not materially changed our methodology for calculating the estimates below in the past three years 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically sales returns and other allowances  the allowance for doubtful accounts  our facility restructuring accrual  and the assessment of the probability of the outcome of litigation against us  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of goodwill  finite lived intangibles and long lived assets 
revenue recognition as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
these estimates affect the deferred revenue line item on our consolidated balance sheet and the net revenue line item on our consolidated statement of income 
estimates regarding revenue affect all of our operating geographies 
we apply the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop as amended by statement of position modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware transactions where the software is not incidental 
for hardware transactions where software is not incidental  we do not bifurcate the fee and we do not apply separate accounting guidance to the hardware and software elements 
for hardware transactions where no software is involved  we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab 
in addition  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware to our on line software subscription services 
we license our software products on a one and two year subscription basis or on a perpetual basis 
our two year subscription licenses include the first year of maintenance and support 
our on line subscription arrangements require customers to pay a fixed fee and receive service over a period of time  generally one or two years 
customers do not pay setup fees 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  except those completed over the 
table of contents internet  we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier or upon delivery of the license key which is delivered primarily through e mail 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and credit worthiness of direct customers 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for indirect customers  we monitor the financial condition and ability to pay for goods sold 
if we do not identify potential collection problems with our indirect customers on a timely basis  we could incur a charge for bad debt that could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to our company 
this means that we defer revenue from the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for both our two year time based licenses and perpetual licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
this assessment generally includes analyses of the variability of renewal rates by product and region and determination of whether a majority of renewals supports our estimated fair value of the maintenance and support obligations 
in cases where renewal rates are not quoted in the initial sales contracts  our assessment is critical because if an estimated fair value cannot be established through separate sales then the fee for the entire arrangement eg delivered software and undelivered maintenance and support obligations is deferred until delivery occurs which for maintenance would be ratably over the service period 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes a specified acceptance provision  recognition occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time of entering into a transaction  we assess whether or not any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests 
if these services are included as part of an arrangement  we recognize the entire fee using the percentage of completion method 
we estimate the percentage of completion based on our estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
estimation of sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  restructuring accrual and litigation sales returns and other allowances 
in each accounting period  our management must make judgments and estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze and monitor current and historical return rates  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
we also budget for our sales incentives each quarter and determine amounts to be spent and we monitor amounts spent against our budgets 
these estimates affect our net revenue line item on our statement 
table of contents of income and affect our net accounts receivable line item on our consolidated balance sheet 
these estimates affect all of our operating geographies 
if our sales returns experience were to increase by an additional of license revenues  our allowance for sales returns at december  would increase and net revenue for would decrease by approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances  current and historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we specifically reserve for any account receivable for which there are identified collection issues 
bad debts have historically been approximately of our average accounts receivable 
these estimates affect the provision for doubtful accounts line item on our statement of income and the net accounts receivable line item on the consolidated balance sheet 
the estimation of uncollectible accounts affects all of our operating geographies 
december  december  in millions allowance for sales return allowance for sales incentives total allowance for sales return and incentives allowance for doubtful accounts total allowance at december   our accounts receivable balance  excluding magic accounts receivable  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
our total allowance for doubtful accounts  including allowance related to magic accounts receivable  amounts to million and our total allowance for sales return and incentives amounts to million 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million and provision for sales returns and other allowances of million as of december  if an additional of our gross accounts receivable were deemed to be uncollectible at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debt expense would increase by approximately million 
restructuring accrual 
as part of a consolidation of activities into our plano  texas facility from our headquarters in santa clara  california  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the first quarter of we recorded this facility restructuring charge in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for exit costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
in order to determine our restructuring charge and corresponding liability  sfas required us to make a number of assumptions 
these assumptions included estimated sublease income over the remaining lease period  estimated term of subleases  estimated utility and real estate broker fees  as well as estimated discount rates for use in calculating the present value of our liability 
we developed these assumptions based on our understanding of the current real estate market in santa clara as well as current market interest rates 
the assumptions used are our management s best estimate at the time of the accrual  and adjustments are made on a periodic basis if better information is obtained 
if  at december   our estimated sublease income were to decrease  the restructuring reserve and related expense would have increased by approximately million 
the estimates regarding our restructuring accrual affect our current liabilities and other long term liabilities line items in our consolidated balance sheet  since this liability will be settled each year through the estimate affects our statement of income in the restructuring line item 
at december   our north american operating geography was the only geography affected by this estimate 
litigation 
management s current estimated range of liability related to litigation that is brought against us from time to time is based on claims for which our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
we recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss as there is 
table of contents no better point of estimate 
because of the uncertainties related to an unfavorable outcome of litigation  and the amount and range of loss on pending litigation  management is often unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as litigation progresses  we continue to assess our potential liability and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
estimates of litigation liability affect our accrued liability line item on our consolidated balance sheet and our general and administrative expense line item on our statement of income 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess and make significant estimates regarding the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of income 
estimates related to income taxes affect the deferred tax asset and liability line items and accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and our income tax benefit expense line item in our statement of income 
income tax estimates affect all of our operating geographies 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  is million  net of a valuation allowance of million due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our historical and estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
tax returns are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
although we believe that adequate accruals have been made for unsettled issues  additional gains or losses could occur in future years from resolution of outstanding matters 
we continue to assess our potential tax liability included in accrued taxes in the consolidated financial statements  and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
valuation of goodwill  intangibles  and long lived assets we account for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of amortization for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles and at least an annual test for impairment 
an impairment review may be performed more frequently in the event circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment review involves a two step process as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are required to make estimates regarding the fair value of our reporting units when testing for potential impairment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenues or earnings for comparable companies 
we estimate cash flows for these purposes using internal budgets based on recent and historical trends 
we base these estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we also make certain judgments about the selection of comparable companies used in the market approach in valuing our reporting units  as well as certain assumptions to allocate shared assets and liabilities to calculate the carrying 
table of contents value for each of our reporting units 
if an impairment were present  these estimates would affect an impairment line item on our consolidated statement of income and would affect the goodwill and or intangible line items in our consolidated balance sheet 
as goodwill is allocated to all of our reporting units  any impairment could potentially affect each operating geography 
based on our current impairment test  there would have to be a significant change in assumptions used in such calculation in order for an impairment to occur as of december  we account for finite lived intangibles and long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under this standard we will record an impairment charge on finite lived intangibles or long lived assets to be held and used when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may not be recoverable 
based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment of intangibles or long lived assets based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
our estimates of cash flows require significant judgment based on our historical results and anticipated results and are subject to many of the factors  noted below as triggering factors  which may change in the near term 
factors considered important  which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
goodwill amounted to million  excluding million related to magic  and million as of december  and  respectively 
we did not hold any indefinite lived intangibles as of december  or net finite lived intangible assets and long lived assets amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
previous restatement of consolidated financial statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for through and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in our form k through and amendment no 
to our form k a through  including in each case  the related notes and  in particular  note describing the restatement 
among others  the more significant categories of restatement adjustments were recorded to properly reflect sales to our distributors and resellers on the sell through basis for through  which is how we have accounted for these sales since  and to correct certain errors previously made in the application of the revenue recognition principles under sop to multi element revenue transactions in through we have determined that  excluding the effect of currency related adjustments  the aggregate amount of net revenue was not reduced as a result of our change to the sell through revenue recognition method for years prior to or adjustments related to multi element licensing arrangements in through these adjustments had the effect of deferring revenue from earlier periods to be recognized in later periods  with amounts deferred in connection with our multi element licensing arrangements generally being recognized in later periods as service and support revenue 
in the aggregate  for  and  the restatement adjustments had the effect of increasing net revenues by million  million and million  respectively  and decreasing expenses by million in  and increasing expenses in and by

many of our customers and potential customers have i delayed initiating the purchase process  ii increased the evaluation time to complete a purchase or postponed  sometimes indefinitely  full it deployments  and or iii reduced their capital expenditure budgets  thereby restricting their software services purchases to those believed by them to be necessary to satisfy an immediate need 
net revenue for includes approximately million of magic revenue 
we sold our magic business in january in the first quarter of  we will expand our perpetual plus licensing arrangements to the united states 
under these arrangements  introduced in europe and asia earlier in  we provide a perpetual license coupled with additional support  with a higher percentage of the contract value allocated to support revenues 
as a result of these arrangements  we expect i an increase in the amount of services and support revenue relative to product revenue as a result of higher renewal rates and ii because support revenues are deferred and recognized over the life of the arrangement  an increased amount of revenue being deferred to future periods 
deferred revenue increased to million which includes million of deferred revenue related to magic  at december  from million at september  and has increased million from december  net revenue by geography the following table sets forth for the periods indicated net revenue  in each of the five geographic regions in which we operate percentage of for the year ended december  net revenue in thousands  except percentages net revenue north america emea japan asia pacific latin america total net revenue 
table of contents net revenue outside of north america united states and canada accounted for approximately  and of net revenue for  and in the previous three years  net revenue from north america and emea has comprised approximately of our business 
in  we saw a weakening of the us dollar against many currencies  but most dramatically against the euro and great britain pound 
as a result of the weakening us dollar  we experienced positive impacts on our net revenue in emea region 
in  total net revenue in north america decreased or million as compared to and decreased or million from to the decrease in revenue is due to the overall economic downturn that has been experienced in the past three years in the united states as well as a softness in corporate spending 
in emea  total net revenue decreased or million from to in  emea net revenue remained relatively flat  increasing or million from as in north america  the european economies have been subject to a prolonged economic downturn resulting in companies temporarily or permanently delaying technology expenditures 
also  in the middle of  we introduced our new perpetual plus licensing model in europe with a larger portion of total contract values being deferred into later years 
our japan  latin america and asia pacific operations combined have historically been approximately of our total business  and we expect this trend to continue 
risks inherent in international revenue include the impact of longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  seasonality due to the slowdown in european business activity during the third quarter  tariffs and other trade barriers  currency fluctuations and difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations 
these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international revenue 
product revenue the following table sets forth for the periods indicated each major category of our product revenue 
percentage of for the year ended december  product revenue in thousands  except percentages term subscription licenses perpetual licenses hardware retail other total product revenue product revenue includes revenue from software licenses  hardware  our retail product and royalties 
the million  or  decrease in product revenue from to is due to i the introduction of our perpetual plus licensing arrangements in emea and asia pacific resulting in reduced product revenues and increased services and support revenues  ii continued softness in corporate spending over the past three years and iii the shift of our focus on the retail boxed product to our on line subscription model for consumers and small and medium sized businesses 
product revenue from to remained relatively flat 
retail revenue in and includes approximately million and million of revenue deferred from prior years as part of our financial restatement 
during through we did not properly establish vsoe on the sales of certain retail products 
we generally expect a decline in our retail boxed products revenue as we continue to shift our focus to our on line subscription services with the related revenues categorized in services and support revenue below 
our customers license our software on a perpetual or term subscription basis depending on their preference 
we expect perpetual licenses to become a larger percentage of product revenue in the future as we 
table of contents implement our perpetual plus licensing model 
we expect the remaining mix of product revenue to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue 
services and support revenue the following table sets forth for the periods indicated each major category of our services and support revenue 
percentage of services for the year ended december  and support revenue in thousands  except percentages support and maintenance consulting training on line subscription arrangements total services and support revenue services and support revenues include revenues from software support and maintenance contracts  consulting  training and on line subscription arrangements 
the million  or  increase in service and support revenue is due to a million increase in our on line subscription mcafee 
com and mcafee asap arrangements  offset by decreases in consulting and training revenues totaling million 
the increase in our on line subscription arrangements is due to an increase in our customer base to approximately million subscribers at the end of  as well as an increase in our mcafee asap on line service for small to medium sized businesses 
we saw decreases in our consulting and training revenues in each year because our customers typically first reduce consulting and training budgets when reducing overall it costs and projects 
in  million more of service and support revenue was recognized as compared to due to our restatement and the deferral of services and support revenue from through with respect to multi element revenue contracts 
excluding this difference  service and support revenue increased by million  reflecting growth of our installed customer base  an overall increase in maintenance pricing year over year and an million increase in on line subscription revenue generated primarily by our mcafee 
com consumer site 
our future profitability and rate of growth  if any  will be directly affected by increased price competition and the size of our revenue base 
our growth rate and net revenue depend significantly on renewals of existing orders as well as our ability to respond successfully to the pace of technological change and expand our customer base 
if our renewal rate or our pace of new customer acquisition slows  our net revenues and operating results would be adversely affected

cost of product revenue 
our cost of product revenue consists primarily of the cost of media  manuals and packaging for products distributed through traditional channels  royalties  and  with respect to hardware based anti virus products and network fault and performance products  computer platforms and other hardware components 
the decrease from to in the cost of product revenue as a percentage of total cost of net revenue from to is due to lower costs of computer platforms and other hardware components as at the end of we began using a more competitive contract manufacturer which also utilized a greater number of standardized computer platforms and hardware components 
we also benefited from the favorable impact of cost control measures 
cost of product revenue as a percentage of total cost of net revenue remained relatively flat between and we anticipate that cost of product revenue will continue to fluctuate as a percent of cost of net revenue 
cost of services and support 
cost of services and support revenue consists principally of salaries and benefits related to employees providing customer support and consulting services 
services and support as a percentage of cost of net revenue remained relatively flat at to in and  and increased to from in the increase from to was due almost exclusively to additional technical support and customer service personnel hired during to meet our customers technical support needs 
we anticipate that cost of service revenue will continue to fluctuate as a percent of cost of net revenue 
amortization of purchased technology 
amortization of purchased technology increased  million or  from to the increase is due to our acquisitions of entercept and intruvert  in respect of which we recorded purchased technology of million and million  respectively

our management believes that a presentation of operating costs excluding stock based compensation provides investors a meaningful basis of evaluating our underlying cost and expense levels 
the size and amount of our stock based compensation charges has varied  and in the future will vary  from period

we plan to increase our research and development expenditures in bangalore  india 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively  research and development expenses remained relatively flat at million in versus million in we believe that continued investment in product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as a result  expect product development expenses to increase in future periods 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars  but will continue to fluctuate as a percent of net revenue 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salary  commissions and benefits for marketing and sales personnel and costs associated with advertising and promotions 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively  marketing and sales expenses decreased million  or from to primarily due to a corresponding decrease in net revenue from to we also experienced lower sales and marketing expense in of approximately i million due to a reduction of salary  benefit and commission expenses following a decrease in headcount of approximately sales personnel  ii million from our reduced use of outside services and other cost saving measures and iii million related to travel expense cost savings measures 
as a result of the change in the way we account for sales commissions  we had lower sales and marketing expense of approximately million 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively  marketing and sales expenses decreased to million in from million in primarily due to a decrease in commissions 
we anticipate that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net revenue 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional services and other general corporate activities 
excluding the effects of stock based compensation of million and million for and  respectively  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in the increase is due to costs incurred in connection with our restatement of million and acquisition related bonuses of million

the recovery for doubtful accounts was million and million in and  respectively 
the provision for doubtful accounts was million in litigation settlement 
we agreed to settle a securities class action litigation in september the million litigation charge was recorded in because our agreement to settle  which established the liability to be probable and estimable  occurred prior to the publication of our consolidated financial statements in october we paid the million settlement in october acquisition related costs not subject to capitalization 
acquisition costs not subject to capitalization consist primarily of expenses incurred by mcafee 
com related to our exchange offer for all outstanding publicly held shares of mcafee 
com class a common stock 
as of december   these charges totaled million or of net revenue 
no additional costs were incurred 
amortization of intangibles 
we expensed million  million  and million of amortization related to intangibles in   and  respectively 
intangibles consist of purchased goodwill  purchased technology and other identifiable intangible assets 
the increase in amortization of million in is the result of the acquisition of intruvert and entercept in the decrease in amortization in was largely a result of the implementation of sfas which requires us to cease amortizing goodwill and  therefore  we realized a decrease in the annual amortization of million 
restructuring costs in january  as part of a restructuring effort to gain operational efficiencies  we consolidated operations formerly housed in three leased facilities in the dallas  texas area into our newly constructed  square foot regional headquarters facility in plano  texas 
the new facility houses approximately  employees working in finance  legal  information technology  and the customer support and telesales groups servicing the mcafee system protection solutions and mcafee network protection solutions businesses 
we also relocated approximately employees from our santa clara  california headquarters 
as a result of this consolidation  in march  we recorded a restructuring charge of million which consisted of a non cash charge of million related to asset disposals and discontinued use of certain leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment  non cash write off of million deferred rent liability  and a million accrual for estimated lease related costs associated with permanently vacated facility in santa clara  california 
the remaining costs associated with vacating the santa clara facility are primarily comprised of the present value of remaining lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  along with costs associated with subleasing the vacated facility and will generally be paid over the remaining lease term ending in during the second and third quarters of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million and million  respectively  which consisted of million related to a headcount reduction of employees and million related to other expenses such as legal expenses incurred in international locations in conjunction with the headcount reduction

adjustments to the facilities accrual will be made if further consolidations are required or if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
the facility restructuring charge was not allocated to our reporting segments

infinity is a lower end model of the intrushield sensor product family that is targeted towards remote offices and branch offices of large enterprises as well as small medium businesses 
at the date we acquired intruvert  we recognized million of in process research and development  and we estimated that  on average  of the development effort had been completed and that the remaining of the development effort would take approximately months to complete and would cost million 
the efforts required to complete the development of these projects principally relate to finalization of coding  and completion of prototyping  verification  and testing activities required to establish that products associated with the technologies can be successfully introduced 
the product was completed in the third quarter of and is being shipped to customers 
the value of the in process technologies was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products  including costs to complete the development of the technologies or products  and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products  excluding the value attributed to integration with our products or that may have been achieved due to efficiencies resulting from the combined sales force or the use of our more effective distribution channel 
these cash flows were discounted back to their net present value using a discount rate of which represents a premium of approximately over our weighted average cost of capital and excluding the value attributable to the use of the in process technologies in future products

the efforts required to complete the development of these projects principally relate to additional design efforts  finalization of coding  and completion of prototyping  verification  and testing activities required to establish that products associated with the technologies can be successfully introduced 
the project has been delayed and product availability is expected in july the value of the in process technologies was determined by estimating the projected net cash flows related to products  including costs to complete the development of the technologies or products  and the future net revenues that may be earned from the products  excluding the value attributed to integration with our products or that may have been achieved due to efficiencies resulting from the combined sales force or the use of the our more effective distribution channel

interest and other income 
interest and other income was million in  million in and million in interest and other income decreased from to primarily due to a decrease of cash and investments of million from to and an overall decrease in average yields on our marketable securities 
in  we used cash of approximately million to purchase entercept and intruvert and million to redeem the remaining portion of our outstanding zero coupon debentures

interest and other expenses 
interest and other expense decreased to million in from million in interest and other expense decreased by million due to a reduction in interest and expense due to the repurchase in of the remaining zero coupon debentures during additionally  in  we realized a full year of effect of the interest rate swap we entered into in july resulting in interest and expense savings of million compared to we also recorded million of capitalized interest in the reduction in our interest expense due to positive effects from our swap is dependent on interest rates 
as interest rates remain low  we will continue to receive positive impact from our swap  however  if interest rates begin to rise  the positive effects of the swap will begin to diminish 
interest and other expense increased slightly to million in from million in interest and other expense during increased million due to the recognition of a full twelve months of interest and expense on the convertible subordinated notes issued in august this was offset by a million reduction in interest and expense due to the partial repurchase of million face value of zero coupon debentures during additionally  we entered into an interest rate swap in july related to the convertible subordinated notes resulting in interest and expense savings during of million over the stated rate

tax expense was and of earnings before income taxes and minority interest for and  respectively 
tax expense for was 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was primarily attributable to the generation of fewer tax credits along with less income being derived in lower tax jurisdictions 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from to was primarily due to foreign tax credit benefits in  the elimination of the goodwill write off  increased benefit from foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate  and a reduction of non deductible and other costs 
each year  our tax expense is mainly influenced by the mix of income between geographic jurisdictions  including taxable income in certain foreign countries 
stock based compensation we recognized stock based compensation expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our stock based compensation charges comprised of the following for the years presented in thousands years ended december  exchange of mcafee 
com options former employees new and existing executives extended life of vested options of terminated employees extended vesting term of options extended period of employee stock purchase plan shares purchased outside employee stock purchase plan and other repriced options warrants to outside consultants pgp restructuring total stock based compensation described below are the events giving rise to the more significant stock based compensation charges in these and the other stock based compensation charges are described in greater detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect significant future stock based compensation charges related to the exchange of mcafee 
com options and repriced employee stock options  with the amount of these charges being impacted by fluctuations in our stock price 
the stock based compensation charges in and with respect to i former employees  relate primarily to charges taken in connection with the former executive officers of mcafee

table of contents accounted for under the variable method of accounting which requires that a compensation charge be remeasured at the end of every reporting period using fair market value 
during and  we recorded a charge of approximately million and million  respectively  related to exchanged options subject to variable accounting 
our stock based compensation charge related to exchanged options subject to variable accounting was based on our closing share price of and on december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had outstanding exchanged options to acquire approximately million of our shares subject to this variable accounting 
extended life of vested options held by terminated employees 
during a significant portion of  we suspended exercises of stock options until our required public company reports were filed with the sec 
the period during which stock option exercises were suspended is known as the black out period 
due to the blackout period  we have extended the exercisability of any options that would otherwise terminate during the blackout period for a period of time equal to a specified period after termination of the blackout period 
accordingly  we have recorded a stock based compensation charge on the date the options should have terminated based on the intrinsic value of the option on the modification date and the option price 
during  we recorded a stock based compensation charge of approximately million for the extension of life of vested options held by terminated employees 
extended period of employee stock purchase plan

repriced options 
on april   we offered to substantially all of our employees  excluding executive officers  the right to cancel certain outstanding stock options and receive new options with an exercise price equivalent to the fair market value of our stock at the time of grant 
options to purchase a total of million shares were cancelled and the same number of new options were granted 
these new options vest at the same rate that they would have vested under previous option plans and are subject to variable accounting 
accordingly  we have and will continue to remeasure compensation cost for these repriced options until these options are exercised  cancelled or forfeited without replacement 
the first valuation period began on july  at december   these options were substantially fully vested 
depending upon movements in the market value of our common stock  this accounting treatment may result in additional stock based compensation charges in future periods

table of contents none of which is deductible for tax purposes  million in cash  million for net deferred tax liabilities and million for tangible assets  net of liabilities 
we also recorded approximately million for acquired in process research and development which was fully expensed upon purchase because technological feasibility had not been established and there was no alternative use for the projects under development 
the intangibles acquired in the acquisition  excluding goodwill  are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to five years or a weighted average period of years 
we also accrued approximately million in duplicative site costs for lease space no longer being utilized and permanently vacated related to the intruvert acquisition of which less than million remains as an accrual as of december  entercept security technologies  inc on april   we acquired of the outstanding capital shares of entercept security technologies  inc entercept  a provider of host based intrusion prevention solutions designed to proactively detect and stop system and network security attacks before they occur  for million in cash

the intangibles acquired in the acquisition  excluding goodwill  are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of two to six years or a weighted average period of years 
as a result of the acquisition  we accrued million in duplicative sites costs for permanently vacated facilities at the acquisition date 
the accrual will be fully utilized by  the end of the original lease term 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the vacated facility  and therefore  adjusted the accrual by the value of the sublease 
the following is a summary of activity in the restructuring accrual related to entercept in in thousands original accrual cash payments adjustments balance  december  liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investments net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities overview we ended with cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million  as compared to  million at the end of the decrease was due primarily to our purchase of entercept and intruvert in for million  our payment of million to settle a pending securities class action lawsuit  and our use of million of cash to repurchase the remaining balance of zero coupon convertible debentures 
the uses of cash were offset by the receipt of approximately million in proceeds from stock 
table of contents issued under employee stock purchase plans and options  as well as cash collections from our customers and the timing of payment of our liabilities 
a more detailed discussion of changes in our liquidity follows 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in  and was primarily the result of our net income of million  million and million  respectively  which is adjusted for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  non cash restructuring charges  acquired in process research and development  stock based compensation and changes in various assets and liabilities such as accounts payable  accounts receivable and other current assets 
our historical and primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
one measure of the effectiveness of our collection efforts is average accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso 
dsos were days  days  and days at december   and we calculate accounts receivable dso on a gross basis by dividing the accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter by the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter multiplied by days 
we expect dso s to vary from period to period because of changes in quarterly revenue and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
in  and  we have not made any significant changes to our payment terms for our customers  which are generally net our balances in accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased million causing a use of cash in operating activities 
a primary cause of the decrease in accrued liabilities from to was our cash payment of million related to our class action litigation settlement 
we are pursuing the collection of insurance proceeds of up to million from our insurance carriers in regards to this litigation settlement 
we will record the proceeds when received 
our operating cash flows will be impacted in the future based on the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we typically pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with invoice terms and conditions  and take advantage of invoice discounts when available 
the timing of future cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the nature of accounts payable arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows 
in  and  we have not made any significant changes to our payment timing to our vendors 
our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the united states 
as of december   approximately million was held outside the united states 
most amounts held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  would be subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
we have provided for united states federal tax liability on these amounts for consolidated financial statement purposes except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
repatriation could result in additional united states federal income tax payments in future years 
where local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds  our intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and we would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
our working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the cause of the decrease in working capital of approximately million is the use of cash discussed above in the overview section  offset in part by the decrease in current liabilities of million from to current liabilities decreased due to the repurchase of the remaining balance of our zero coupon convertible debentures in  offset by an increase of million in the current portion of deferred revenue 
our new perpetual plus licensing model  results in less revenue recognition up front  therefore causing increases in our deferred revenue 
we are currently under an sec and doj investigation 
as a result of these investigations  we may be exposed to penalties that may be material to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash and internally generated funds 
we expect to continue generating positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict whether current trends and conditions will continue or what the effect on our business might be from the competitive environment in which we operate 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
investing activities 
a summary of our investing activities at december   and is as follows in thousands 
the detail of these line items can be seen in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
activity cash payments for acquisitions cash payments for property and equipment net proceeds purchases of investments in marketable securities cash payments for restricted cash sales of common stock investments net cash used in provided by investing activities acquisitions in  we paid cash for our acquisitions of entercept and intruvert in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we purchased intruvert and entercept to enhance our network intrusion prevention products 
in september  to among other things  reduce customer and brand confusion  we acquired the outstanding minority interest in mcafee 
com for a combination of shares our common stock and million total cash payments 
in  we also purchased several smaller entities for cash in the amount of million in order to enhance our products and improve distribution in latin america 
in  we repurchased the shares of networks associate japan for million due to a change in our business strategy and paid million for acquired technology 
we may buy or make investments in complementary companies  products and technologies 
our available cash and equity and debt securities may be used to acquire or invest in companies or products  possibly resulting in significant acquisition related charges to earnings and dilution to our stockholders 
we have also made divestures previously 
for example  in january  we completed the sale of our magic service desk business as part of our continued focus on security and security related products 
in  we received cash proceeds of approximately million  subject to final purchase price adjustments 
property and equipment we added million of equipment during to update hardware for our employees and enhance various back office systems  including our new customer relationship management system which we are deploying in early in  we added million of property and equipment  including approximately million related to the construction of our regional office in plano  texas 
we added million of property and equipment in our property and equipment additions have been funded from operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including our hiring of employees  the rate of change in computer hardware software used in our business and our business outlook 

table of contents investments we received net proceeds from and made net purchases of and sales maturities of our marketable securities of million  million  and million in  and we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investments are made with a policy of capital preservation and liquidity as the primary objectives 
we generally hold investments in corporate bonds and u 
s 
government agency securities to maturity  however  we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity of sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
restricted cash at december   we had on deposit approximately million as collateral for our interest rate swap arrangements we entered into related to our million of subordinated convertible debt 
the arrangements require we keep a minimum amount of million on deposit with the swap counterparties  subject to increase based on the fair value of the swap 
financing activities 
a primary use of financing activities in was the use of million of cash to repurchase the remaining balance of our zero coupon convertible debt 
as a result of this redemption  we recorded a total loss on repurchase of approximately million 
in and  we also repurchased portions of this debt using million and million of cash 
historically  our recurring cash flows provided by financing activities have been from the receipt of cash from the issuance of common stock under stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we received cash proceeds from these plans in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and is contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in the plans and general market conditions 
as our stock price rises  more participants are in the money in their options  and thus  more likely to exercise their options  which results in cash to us 
as our stock price decreases  more of our employees are out of the money or under water in regards to their options  and therefore  are not able to exercise options and results in no cash received by us 
the decrease in cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plans from to was primarily the result of the blackout period in most of due to our restatement 
from march through november  all purchases under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan were suspended pending the filing with the sec of our public company reports  including our restated financial results 
following the october  filing of these reports  activity under our plans was resumed 
in  we received net proceeds from the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes in the amount of million 
we used the proceeds from this offering for working capital purposes 
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations at december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total 
table of contents under the terms of the convertible subordinated notes in a total principal amount of million  in  and  we will make interest payments of million to the note holders 
pursuant to a related interest rate swap  the swap counter parties are obligated to make regular payments to us with respect to these interest obligations based on the interest rate and  subject to quarterly resets  we are required to make regular payments to the counter parties based on a floating rate of libor plus 
operating leases are primarily for leased office space and for leased office equipment 
we generally issue purchase orders to our contract manufacturers with delivery dates from four to six weeks from the purchase order date 
in addition  we regularly provide such contract manufacturers with rolling six month forecasts of product requirements for planning and long lead time parts procurement purposes only 
we are committed to accept delivery of materials pursuant to our purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such order or allow us to cancel orders beyond certain agreed lead times 
such cancellations may or may not include cancellation costs payable by us 
if we are unable to adequately manage our contract manufacturers and adjust such commitments for changes in demand  we may incur additional inventory expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
all of our subsidiaries are owned by us and are fully consolidated into our consolidated financial statements 
convertible debt on august   we issued convertible subordinated notes due with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the issuance generated net proceeds to us of approximately million after deducting fees and expenses 
the notes mature on august   unless earlier redeemed by us at our option or converted at the holder s option 
interest is payable semi annually in cash in arrears on february and august of each year  commencing february  at the option of the holder  the notes may be converted into our common stock at any time  unless previously redeemed  at a conversion price of per share 
at any time between august  and august   we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a repurchase price of of the principal amount 
after august   the repurchase price is of the principal amount 
the notes are unsecured and are subordinated to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness as defined in the related indenture 
we have no financial covenants related to these convertible subordinated notes 
in february  we issued zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures due with an aggregate face amount at maturity of million and generating net proceeds to us of approximately million 
prior to december   we repurchased zero coupon debentures with an aggregate face amount of approximately million  at a total price of million 
on february   we paid approximately million in cash to redeem approximately million in face amount of the zero coupon debentures 
on june   we redeemed the remaining zero coupon debentures with an aggregate face amount at maturity of million for a net price of million 

table of contents stock repurchases the table below sets forth all repurchases by us of our common stock during the quarter ended december  whether or not pursuant to a publicly announced plan or program in thousands  except price per share total number of approximate dollar shares purchased as value of shares that part of publicly may yet be average price announced plan or purchased under our total number of paid per repurchase stock repurchase period shares purchased share program program october na november december total in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in the open market from time to time over the next two years  depending upon market conditions  share price and other factors 
we purchased  shares for a total of million in in conjunction with a previous stock repurchase program  prior to  we sold european style put options for million shares of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase plan 
in february  we settled the remaining put options  which resulted in the purchase of million shares of our stock for approximately million 
in  we deposited approximately million shares of our common stock with a trustee for the benefit of the employees of dr 
solomon in respect of their stock options assumed in our acquisition of the company 
these shares are included in our total outstanding share balance 
we believe our obligations with respect to these assumed stock options have been terminated or satisfied  and we are attempting to obtain the return of these shares 
financial risk management the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
foreign currency risk as a global concern  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to non us dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in japan  canada  australia  europe  latin america  and asia 
at the present time  we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and do not generally hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities 
the success of this activity depends upon estimates of transaction activity denominated in various currencies  primarily the japanese yen  canadian dollar  australian dollar  the euro  and the british pound 
to the extent that these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
to reduce exposures associated with nonfunctional net monetary asset positions in various currencies  we enter into spot  forward and swap foreign exchange contracts 
our foreign exchange contracts range from one to three months in original maturity 
in general  we have not hedged anticipated foreign currency cash flows nor do we enter into forward contracts for trading purposes 
we do not use any derivatives for speculative purposes 
our existing forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly are marked to 
table of contents market at the end of each reporting period with any unrealized gain or loss being recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
net realized gains and losses arising from settlement of our forward foreign exchange contracts were not significant in   and the forward contracts outstanding and their fair values are presented below as of december in thousands carrying fair carrying fair value value value value euro british pound sterling singapore dollar australian dollar canadian dollar interest rate risk in july  we entered into interest rate swap transactions the transactions with two investment banks the banks  to hedge the interest rate risk of its outstanding convertible subordinated note due the notes see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the notional amount of the transactions was million to match the entire principal amount of the notes 
we receive from the banks fixed payments equal to percent of the notional amount  payable on february and august which started on august  in exchange  we pay to the banks floating rate payments based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus multiplied by the notional amount of the transactions with the libor resetting every three months which began on august  the transactions terminate on august  termination date  subject to certain early termination provisions if on or after august  and prior to august  the twenty day average closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds 
the transactions qualified and were designated as a fair value hedge under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to hedge against movements in the fair value of the notes due to changes in the benchmark interest rate 
under the fair value hedge model  the derivative is recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with an offsetting entry to the consolidated income statement 
in addition  changes in fair value of the notes due to changes in the benchmark interest rate are recognized as a basis adjustment to the carrying amount of the notes with an offsetting entry to the consolidated income statement 
the gain or loss from the change in fair value of the transaction and the offsetting change in the fair value of the notes are recognized as interest and other expense 
the net gain recorded as of december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
to test effectiveness of the hedges  regression analysis is performed at least quarterly comparing the change in fair value of the transactions and the notes 
the fair values of the transactions and the notes are calculated at least quarterly as the present value of the contractual cash flows to the expected maturity date  where the expected maturity date is based on probability weighted analysis of interest rates relating to the five year libor curve and our stock prices 
for the year ended december   the hedge was highly effective and therefore  the ineffective portion did not have a material impact on earnings 
in support of our obligation under the transactions  we are required to maintain with the banks a minimum level of cash and investment collateral of million and periodically adjust the overall level of collateral depending on the fair market value of the transactions 
this minimum amount of collateral is presented as restricted cash in our consolidated financial statements

these investments are reviewed for other than temporary declines in value on a quarterly basis 
reasons for other than temporary declines in value include whether the related company would have insufficient cash flow to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the operating performance or operating model and changes in market conditions 
during  we disposed of our shares in a majority of these investments 
as of december   the minority investments we continue to hold totaled million at estimated fair value 
these investments were in a public company 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in the securities held at december  that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps over six and twelve month time horizons 
beginning fair values represent the market principal plus accrued interest and dividends at december  ending fair values are the market principal plus accrued interest  dividends and reinvestment income at six and twelve month time horizons
