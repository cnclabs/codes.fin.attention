about dow dow is a diversified  worldwide manufacturer of more than  basic and performance chemicals and plastics  and agricultural products that are primarily used by customers as raw materials to manufacture a diverse range of products  which serve numerous consumer markets 
dow is the largest us producer of chemicals and plastics  in terms of sales  with total sales of billion in the company conducts its worldwide operations through global businesses  which are reported in six operating segments performance plastics  performance chemicals  agricultural sciences  plastics  chemicals  and hydrocarbons and energy 
with customers in more than countries  approximately percent of the company s sales are in north america  percent are in europe and the remaining percent are from sales to customers in asia pacific and latin america 
the company employs approximately  people and has a broad  global reach with manufacturing sites in countries 
overview relatively slow global economic growth in and dampened demand in the chemical industry in those years  resulting in substantial overcapacity for many products 
for example  global industry operating rates for ethylene  a basic building block chemical  had fallen to near percent  substantially below the percent level that is generally considered to represent balanced supply demand conditions 
although the prices of oil and natural gas  which are key raw materials for the chemical industry  had declined somewhat during those years  prices of many chemical industry products had fallen further  squeezing margins 
late in  costs of these raw materials began to rise sharply  straining the profitability of the chemical industry even more 
in january  following two years of disappointing results  the company announced an action plan action plan with the express goal of improving the earnings and financial strength of dow 
to accomplish this  all corporate initiatives that were not considered business critical were postponed or cancelled  so all employees could be engaged and focused on four objectives to manage the price of dow s products without sacrificing volume to reduce structural costs by million and capital expenditures by million to shut down under utilized and non competitive assets to accelerate changes in dow s portfolio  including the sale of non strategic assets in response to the action plan  sales in increased percent to billion  establishing a new sales record for the company 
was the first year since the last industry peak in that the margin between selling prices and the cost of feedstocks improved 
price volume management continues to be a difficult challenge for dow 
while dow s overall operating rate improved from percent in to percent in  industry operating rates remain relatively low and some key products are still in oversupply 
due to the focus on costs  the company reduced its structural costs in by more than million including reductions in materials and supplies  purchased services  travel and labor costs  exceeding the goal set in the action plan by more than million 
this reduction was accomplished by controlling discretionary spending throughout the organization  through the application of six sigma methodology a disciplined approach to achieving performance excellence and through the reduction of approximately  employees 
reflecting the success of dow s efforts to reduce costs  selling  general and administrative expenses were down percent in from dow s purchased feedstock and energy costs which are largely based on derivatives of oil and natural gas rose percent in  an increase of billion 
these costs represented percent of the company s total production costs and operating expenses in because these costs are substantial  dow has taken a number of steps over the years to help mitigate the impact of high and volatile feedstock costs conservation since the early s  the company has added nine new co generation facilities and improved overall manufacturing efficiency 
global sourcing the company s global network of manufacturing plants allows it to supply export markets from lower cost sites 
feedstock flexibility dow s manufacturing flexibility allows it to optimize feedstock mix  reducing exposure to higher cost feedstocks 
hedging the company uses both financial and physical hedging to reduce the negative effect of feedstock price volatility 
capital expenditures in were billion  down more than million from  exceeding the company s goal set in the action plan by more than million 
this was accomplished without sacrificing the efficiency  safety and environmental performance of dow s manufacturing facilities 
as discussed in environmental matters  the company s key environmental measures continued to improve in  with percent of dow s manufacturing plants reporting no injuries during the year 
working capital management was another significant contributor to improved financial performance 
in  the company improved days sales in inventory from days to days  and days sales outstanding in receivables from days to days 
in  the company reviewed its assets to identify under utilized and non competitive assets 
as a result  dow shut down two union carbide ethylene plants in texas  as well as small facilities in north america  europe and latin america during the year 
also during  the company sold assets identified as non strategic  including the oryzalin herbicide business  the methyl glucoside and lanolin derivatives businesses  and union carbide s joint venture interest in sunrise chemical llc 
as a result of these actions and some improvement in overall economic conditions  dow substantially increased earnings  improved cash flow and reduced net debt in diluted earnings per common share were in including a tax benefit of million  equivalent to per share  compared with a loss of per share in which included a net charge of billion  per share  primarily related to potential asbestos liabilities  merger related expenses and restructuring 
cash provided by operating activities improved billion in compared with free cash flow cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and dividends paid to stockholders improved billion 
net debt total debt minus cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest bearing deposits was down million in net debt to total capitalization was percent at the end of  down from percent at the end of last year 
the company anticipates that stronger global economic growth in will improve chemical industry demand  tightening supply demand balances to some extent 
however  feedstock and energy costs are expected to remain high and volatile  especially early in the year 
the company will continue to focus on the steps outlined in the action plan price volume management  sustaining the improvement in structural costs achieved in  continued discipline in capital spending  targeting billion in  additional shutdown of non competitive assets  and further divestitures of non strategic assets 
the objective of these actions is to further improve dow s earnings and financial position 
results of operations dow s sales for were billion  compared with billion in and billion in sales for the year grew percent  as prices rose percent and volume grew percent 
the increase in prices  which was driven by increasing feedstock and energy costs and the favorable impact of currency in europe  was broad based as prices improved across all businesses and in all geographic areas 
the increase in volume reflected an improvement in economic conditions 
while volume improved in all geographic areas  the change in volume across the operating segments was mixed  volume was up in all operating segments except performance plastics  which was flat compared with last year  and plastics  which reported a slight decline 
in  sales declined slightly compared with as selling prices fell percent and volume increased percent 
prices in were lower in all operating segments and across all geographic areas  reflecting the difficult economic environment

the decline in volume also reflected the october start up of sal petrochemical zhangjiagang co 
ltd  a joint venture in the people s republic of china  which now supplies local customers that were supplied by dow in overall demand began to recover in the second half of the year as customers began to restock inventories 
ebit increased significantly over as the higher selling prices and cost reduction initiatives more than offset the impact of higher styrene monomer costs 
plastics outlook for the anticipation of continuing volatility in feedstock and energy costs and ongoing low levels of capacity utilization will make a challenging year for plastics 
polyethylene selling prices  while indicative of changes in feedstock and energy costs  are expected to continue to increase in  with volume improvement as demand returns to more historical growth levels 
with no new global production capacity anticipated in  industry capacity utilization rates should continue to improve 
polypropylene pricing is expected to improve in as industry supply demand balances tighten 
volume improvement is anticipated in as global demand continues to grow and no new global production capacity is expected to be added during the year 
polystyrene volume is expected to improve in as demand increases with generally improved economic conditions 
this increase  combined with little new capacity for styrene monomer within the industry  is expected to result in higher polystyrene prices 
there may be some tightness in styrene monomer availability during the first half of due to scheduled plant turnarounds  which should support higher polystyrene pricing 
chemicals chemicals sales were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in prices rose percent versus  due to increases in all major products organic intermediates  solvents and monomers oism  caustic soda  chlorinated organics  vinyl chloride monomer vcm  and ethylene glycol eg 
volume was up percent for  with increases in chlorinated organics  vcm  oism and eg 
these increases were offset slightly by a decline in caustic soda volume and the initial phaseout of the ethanol business which is part of oism 
in  prices declined percent and volume grew percent versus vcm sales were up percent due to a percent increase in prices and a percent increase in volume 
price increases were driven in part by increased feedstock and energy costs 
caustic soda sales were up percent due to increasing prices partially offset by declining volume due to weak demand from the pulp and paper industry 
industry capacity rationalizations continued in the united states resulting in a slight global decline in chlor alkali capacity 
eg sales were up strongly from with prices increasing percent and volume increasing percent 
prices increased due to higher feedstock and energy costs and a tightening supply demand balance 
volume increased as a result of increasing demand in the polyethylene terephthalate and polyester industries 
oism sales were up percent due to price increases 
oism continued to operate within a highly competitive environment as the solvents and intermediates industry continued consolidation in europe and north america 
ebit for the segment was income of million in versus a loss of million in and income of million in ebit in improved principally due to strong volume  higher prices and cost reductions offset by rising feedstock and energy costs 
equity earnings improved due to strong results from equate and the optimal group 
ebit in was lower primarily due to declining prices that were only partially offset by lower feedstock and energy costs 
ebit in was also impacted by costs related to the start up of new vcm facilities in freeport  texas  and chlor alkali facilities in stade  germany  and a million charge for the write down of assets related to the shutdown of a chlor alkali facility in fort saskatchewan  alberta  canada 
chemicals outlook for vcm margins are expected to continue to be affected by volatile feedstock and energy prices 
operating rates for manufacturers of polyvinyl chloride  which is a major end use product for vcm  are expected to increase  thereby fueling higher demand for vcm 
caustic soda prices are expected to show gradual improvement throughout as the supply demand balance improves 
both price and volume for eg are expected to increase in as the global recovery continues 
no new eg industry capacity is expected until late  therefore  the balance of supply demand is anticipated to tighten 
oism volume is expected to continue its upward trend in as global market conditions improve 
pricing will be driven by changes in feedstock and energy costs 
no additional industry capacity is expected to come on line in stronger demand is expected to lead to an improvement in the supply demand balance in the solvents and intermediates industry 
the company expects to complete its exit of the ethanol business during  as announced in october hydrocarbons and energy hydrocarbons and energy sales were billion in  compared with billion in and billion in prices increased percent and volume grew percent compared to last year

see results of operations for a discussion of results of operations in and cash provided by operating activities in increased versus due to a number of factors 
accounts payable increased and inventories decreased due to the company s efforts to optimize working capital 
this was partially offset  as trade accounts receivable balances increased due to improved sales in the fourth quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of cash used in investing activities in increased slightly versus the level of capital expenditures decreased as a result of dow s action plan to improve financial performance 
however  this impact was more than offset by the company s use of cash to purchase previously leased manufacturing facilities in argentina for million reflected in purchase of previously leased assets in the consolidated statement of cash flows and the minority interests in several consolidated companies 
cash used in investing activities decreased in compared with due primarily to less acquisition related activity in versus cash was used in financing activities in versus being provided by financing activities in a decrease in the level of proceeds provided by the issuance of long term debt was the primary contributor to this change 
cash provided by financing activities decreased in compared with an increase in net cash generated from short and long term borrowings was partially offset by an increase in dividends paid in in addition  cash was generated in from the issuance of preferred securities by a new subsidiary 
working capital at december in millions current assets   current liabilities   working capital   current ratio cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and interest bearing deposits increased million in at december   total inventories were billion  down from billion at december   primarily due to the company s supply chain optimization efforts and the sales of several lines of business  including the methyl glucoside and lanolin derivatives businesses from amerchol  dow agrosciences oryzalin herbicide business  several small sentrachem businesses and the company s latex glove business

at december   there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
in the event dow is unable to access these short term markets  due to a systemic disruption or other extraordinary events  dow has the ability to access liquidity through its committed and available credit facilities with various us and foreign banks totaling billion in support of its working capital requirements and commercial paper borrowings 
these facilities include a billion day revolving credit facility and a billion year revolving credit facility  both of which mature in june the company intends to renew these facilities at maturity 
additional unused credit facilities totaling million were available for use by foreign subsidiaries 
at december   the company had  million of sec registered securities available for issuance under a shelf registration  as well as euro billion approximately billion available for issuance under the company s euro medium term note program

on march   standard poor s lowered the company s senior unsecured debt rating from a to a and its short term debt rating from a to a and maintained its rating outlook as negative 
the company s ability to access credit facilities has not been affected as a result of these changes 
variable interest entities at the beginning of  the company had operating leases with nine special purpose entities that were variable interest entities vies as defined under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
seven of the vies were dissolved during the second quarter of  and the rights and obligations of the dissolved vies under the existing lease agreements were assumed by lessors that were not vies 
information regarding the remaining two vies follows 
during the second quarter of  dow terminated its lease of an ethylene facility in the netherlands with a vie and entered into a lease with a new owner trust  which is also a vie 
however  dow is not the primary beneficiary of the owner trust and is  therefore  not required to consolidate the owner trust 
at december   the facility was valued at million 
upon expiration of the lease  which matures in  dow may purchase the facility for an amount based upon a fair market value determination 
at december   dow had provided to the owner trust a residual value guarantee of million  which represents dow s maximum exposure to loss under the lease 
given the productive nature of the facility  it is probable that the facility will have continuing value to dow or the owner trust in excess of the residual value guarantee 
dow had an operating lease with a vie established in as a foreign company that leased ethylene and polyethylene manufacturing facilities in argentina 
during the fourth quarter of  dow purchased these manufacturing facilities from the vie for million 
this asset purchase terminated the company s relationship with the vie 
see note m to the consolidated financial statements for further information on vies 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  additional information related to these obligations can be found in notes j  k  l  m and s to the consolidated financial statements

deferred tax liabilities may vary according to changes in tax laws  tax rates and the operating results of the company 
as a result  it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact to an individual year 
therefore  all noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities have been reflected in and beyond 
annual payments to resolve asbestos litigation will vary based on changes in defense strategies  changes in state and national law  and claims filing and resolution rates 
as a result  it is impractical to determine the anticipated payments in any given year 
therefore  the noncurrent asbestos related liability of  million has been reflected in and beyond 
includes outstanding purchase orders and other commitments  obtained through a survey of the company  greater than million 
the company also had outstanding guarantees at december  additional information related to these guarantees can be found in the guarantees table provided in note j to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook for in january  the company announced its action plan  which was designed to improve financial performance in the action plan included a percent reduction in overall capital expenditures from levels  a reduction in structural costs of million from levels  the divestiture of non strategic and under performing assets  and the shutdown of assets that were underutilized or noncompetitive 
other than those activities necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of plants  corporate initiatives were delayed or canceled 
this program was expected to improve overall free cash flow defined as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends paid to stockholders by billion in the company exceeded its targets in capital expenditures were reduced by percent and structural costs were reduced by more than million from levels 
these changes  combined with improved business results and better working capital management  resulted in free cash flow in of billion  an improvement of more than billion compared with in  the company expects to build on the foundation laid by the action plan 
the company will continue to aggressively manage price and volume with the goal of improving margins 
in addition  the company plans to further improve productivity  shut down noncompetitive assets and divest or swap non strategic assets 
capital expenditures are expected to increase to billion in  an amount significantly below the level of depreciation  but sufficient to maintain the safety and reliability of the company s facilities 
approximately billion in debt will become due in the company will either issue additional debt or will utilize a portion of its short term investments to pay down this debt as scheduled 
the company has sufficient cash to meet its scheduled debt obligation in capital expenditures capital spending for the year was billion  down percent from billion in and the lower capital spending in reflects the results of the company s plan to improve financial performance 
the capital spending plan was designed to ensure that activities necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of plants were maintained  while other initiatives were delayed or canceled 
in  approximately percent of the company s capital expenditures was directed toward additional capacity for new and existing products  compared with percent in approximately percent was committed to projects related to environmental protection  safety  loss prevention and industrial hygiene in  compared with percent in the remaining capital was utilized to maintain the company s existing asset base  including projects related to productivity improvements  energy conservation and facilities support 
major projects underway during included expansion of production facilities for polymeric mdi and ethylene in freeport  texas  chlorine in stade  germany  dow xla fibers in tarragona  spain  and oligonucleotides in midland  michigan 
additional major projects included conversion of an aluminum chloride plant to produce zeolite catalyst in freeport and installations of a brine pipeline in white castle  louisiana  and a hazardous waste incineration kiln in midland 
because the company designs and builds most of its capital projects in house  it had no material capital commitments other than for the purchase of materials from fabricators 
dividends on february   the board of directors announced a quarterly dividend of per share  payable april   to stockholders of record on march  since  the company has paid a cash dividend every quarter and  in each instance  dow has maintained or increased the amount of the dividend  adjusted for stock splits 
during that year period  dow has increased the amount of the quarterly dividend times approximately percent of the time and maintained the amount of the quarterly dividend approximately percent of the time 
the company declared dividends of per share both in and  and per share in other matters accounting changes see note a to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting changes and recently issued accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note a to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
following are the company s critical accounting policies impacted by judgments  assumptions and estimates litigation the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business 
the company routinely assesses the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known issue and an actuarial analysis of historical claims experience for incurred but not reported matters 
dow has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers 
these policies provide coverage that is utilized to minimize the impact  if any  of the legal proceedings 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter

asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem  are and have been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past thee decades 
a liability for resolving both pending and future asbestos related claims through has been estimated and recorded 
the liability was estimated by analysis  research planning corporation arpc  a consulting firm with broad experience in estimating resolution costs associated with mass tort litigation  including asbestos 
the estimate was based on the following four assumptions in the near term  the number of future claims to be filed against union carbide and amchem will be at a level consistent with levels experienced immediately prior to the number of future claims to be filed against union carbide and amchem will decline at a fairly constant rate each year from the percentage of claims settled by union carbide and amchem out of the total claims resolved whether by settlement or dismissal will be consistent with the percentage for and the average settlement values for pending and future claims will be equivalent to those experienced during and based on the estimate provided by arpc  union carbide increased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims at december  to billion 
at december   union carbide s asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion 
union carbide also increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion at december  at december   union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was billion 
in addition  union carbide had receivables for insurance recoveries for defense and resolution costs of million at december  and million at december  at each balance sheet date  union carbide compares current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the assumptions used in the arpc study to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate 
based on union carbide s review of activity and arpc s review and analysis of claims activity  union carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required at december  the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable were based upon currently known facts 
however  projecting future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claims  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded

environmental matters the company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
the recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the company had accrued obligations of million at december   for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
at december   the company had accrued obligations of million for environmental remediation and restoration costs  including million for the remediation of superfund sites 
this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
for further discussion  see environmental matters in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note j to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at december   rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note l to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the company s actuarial firm  which includes the actuary s review of the asset class return expectations of several respected consultants and economists  based on broad equity and bond indices 
the company s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance and comparisons to expected returns of peer companies with similar fund assets is also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was percent 
this assumption was maintained at percent for determining net periodic pension expense 
the company s historical actual return averaged percent for the ten year period ending december  the actual rate of return in was percent 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
the company bases the determination of pension expense or income on a market related valuation of plan assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets 
since the market related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of plan assets will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
over the life of the plan  both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized 
for the year ending december   billion of net losses remain to be recognized by the us qualified plans in the calculation of the market related value of plan assets 
these net losses will result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market related value of assets 
the increase or decrease in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains and losses is presented in the following table increase decrease in market related asset value due to recognition of prior asset gains and losses in millions total  the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations of the us qualified plans is based on long term bonds receiving an aa or better rating by a recognized rating agency 
the resulting discount rate decreased from percent at december   to percent at december  for  the company decreased its assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels for the us qualified plans from percent for to percent 
based on the revised pension assumptions and changes in the market related value of assets due to the recognition of prior asset gains and losses  the company expects to record approximately million of incremental expense for all us pension and other postretirement benefits in the value of the us qualified plan assets increased from billion at december   to billion at december  the investment performance increased the funded status of the us qualified plans  net of benefit obligations  by million from december  to december  this increase was somewhat mitigated by a decline in the discount rate assumption 
for  the company expects to make cash contributions of approximately million for all of the us pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  both positive and negative  the company recognizes future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset balance of billion  after valuation allowances of million 
in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets  the company relies principally on forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences and the availability of tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of  million  million of which is subject to expiration in the years in order to realize these deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  the company needs taxable income of approximately billion across multiple jurisdictions 
the taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration between is approximately million

to meet the company s public commitments  as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject  dow has well defined policies  requirements and management systems 
dow s eh s management system ems defines for the businesses the who  what  when and how needed to achieve the company s policies  requirements  performance objectives  leadership expectations and public commitments 
ems is also designed to minimize the long term cost of environmental protection and to comply with these laws and regulations 
in and  the security aspects of dow s ems were strengthened to require that site vulnerability assessments be conducted to ensure appropriate safeguards to protect dow s employees and physical assets in a post world 
furthermore  to ensure effective utilization  the ems is integrated into a company wide management system for eh s  operations  quality and human resources 
it is dow s policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment 
first  dow works to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research  process design  plant operations and maintenance 
second  dow finds ways to reuse and recycle materials 
finally  unusable or non recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste 
treatment may include destruction by chemical  physical  biological or thermal means 
disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated 
dow has specific requirements for wastes that are transferred to non dow facilities  including the periodic auditing of these facilities 
dow believes third party verification is a cornerstone of world class eh s performance and building public trust 
numerous dow sites in europe  latin america  australia and north america have received third party verification of dow s compliance with responsible care and with outside specifications such as iso additional sites in the united states will receive third party auditing over the next three years in support of new industry wide responsible care expectations 
in  for the second year in a row  dow received the american chemistry council s responsible care employee health safety code sustained excellence award 
the annual sustained excellence award recognizes companies that have demonstrated outstanding safety records over a three year period 
dow remains the only company from the large size category to ever receive this award 
for the fifth year in a row  dow was also included in the dow jones sustainability group index 
dow s eh s policies helped the company achieve excellent safety performance in there were no employee or contractor fatalities during the year  and dow improved its personal injury and illness osha occupational safety and health administration rate  with percent of dow s facilities recording no injuries at all 
the company also posted a significant reduction in leaks  breaks and spills 
however  dow saw an increase in notices of violation from environmental regulatory agencies in improvement in environmental compliance is a top management priority  and a number of initiatives are underway to improve compliance in climate change there is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg due to human activities continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting the climate 
political debates continue about how to implement fair and effective ghg mitigation efforts 
dow takes global climate change very seriously and is not waiting for the resolution of the debate 
dow is committed to reducing its ghg intensity lbs of ghg per lb of product  developing climate friendly products and processes  and  over the longer term  implementing technology solutions to achieve even greater climate change improvements 
since  dow has reduced ghg intensity by over percent 
total direct emissions of ghg have also been significantly reduced 
this trend could reverse  however  depending on business growth  capacity utilization and the pace of new technology development 
given the uncertainties regarding implementation of the kyoto protocol and related climate change policies  it is speculative to engage in an assessment of either the potential liability or benefit associated with climate change issues 
as noted in the dow global public report which can be found on dow s environment  health and safety webpage at www 
dow 
com  the company is making progress toward its goal to improve energy efficiency by percent 
at such time that dow achieves this goal  it will have avoided the production of over trillion btus  a savings equivalent to all of the electricity used by the residential users in the state of california for one year 
these efficiency improvements also result in the reduction of ghg emissions 
dow also contributes to the climate change solution by producing products that help others reduce ghg emissions  such as lightweight plastics for automobiles  and insulation for energy efficient homes and appliances 
in addition  several construction  fiber and packaging products are made from renewable resources  such as corn sugar  wheat straw and soybeans 
in  dow demonstrated its commitment to technological innovation and conservation though its exploration of renewable energy sources 
in may  dow and general motors announced the largest fuel cell collaboration to date  whereby dow will provide hydrogen from its production processes to eventually generate megawatts of power at its freeport  texas  facility 
thirty five megawatts are equivalent to the energy needs of  homes 
dow does not currently engage in ghg emissions trading but has formed an emissions strategy board to study this concept and seek effective mechanisms to achieve ghg reductions at the lowest possible cost 
environmental remediation dow accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and existing technologies 
the nature of such remediation includes  for example  the management of soil and groundwater contamination and the closure of contaminated landfills and other waste management facilities 
in the case of landfills and other active waste management facilities  dow recognizes the costs over the useful life of the facility 
the accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
to assess the impact on the financial statements  environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
these liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
dow had an accrued liability of million at december   related to the remediation of current or former dow owned sites 
the liability related to remediation at december  was million 
the company has not recorded any third party recovery related to these sites as a receivable 
in addition to current and former dow owned sites  under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and equivalent state laws hereafter referred to collectively as superfund law  dow is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where dow allegedly disposed of  or arranged for the treatment or disposal of  hazardous substances 
dow readily cooperates in the remediation of these sites where the company s liability is clear  thereby minimizing legal and administrative costs 
because superfund law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site  dow has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties prps at each site  the estimated apportionment of costs among all prps  and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share 
management s estimate of the company s remaining liability for the remediation of superfund sites at december  was million  which has been accrued  although the ultimate cost with respect to these sites could exceed that amount 
at december   the company s liability for the remediation of superfund sites was million  the company also had receivables of million for probable recoveries from other prps related to superfund sites 
information regarding environmental sites is provided below environmental sites dow owned sites superfund sites number of sites at january sites added during year sites closed during year number of sites at december dow owned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed in the us by the resource conservation recovery act or analogous state law 
of these sites were formerly owned by dowell schlumberger  inc  a group of companies in which the company previously owned percent 
dow sold its interest in dowell schlumberger in superfund sites are sites  including sites not owned by dow  where remediation obligations are imposed by superfund law 
the company s manufacturing sites in freeport  texas  and midland  michigan  are the sites for which the company has the largest environmental remediation accruals 
from the start of operations at the freeport site in the s until the mid s  manufacturing wastes were typically placed in on site pits and landfills 
the resulting soil and groundwater contamination is being assessed and remediated under the provisions of the resource conservation recovery act rcra  in concert with the state of texas 
at december   the company had an accrual of million related to environmental remediation at the freeport manufacturing site 
in  million was spent on environmental remediation at the freeport site 
similar to the freeport site  in the early days of operations at the midland site  manufacturing wastes were usually disposed of on site  resulting in soil and groundwater contamination  which has been contained and managed on site under a series of rcra permits and regulatory agreements 
the most recent hazardous waste operating license for the midland site  issued in  also included provisions for the company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off site contamination from historic midland site operations 
the scope of the investigation includes midland area soils  tittabawassee and saginaw river sediment and floodplain soils  and saginaw bay 
at december   the company had an accrual of million for environmental remediation and investigation associated with the midland site 
in  the company spent million on environmental remediation at the midland site 
in total  the company s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was million at december   compared with million at the end of this is management s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the company has accrued liabilities  although the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to twice that amount 
it is the opinion of the company s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those accrued or disclosed will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures for environmental protection were million in  million in and million in asbestos related matters of union carbide corporation union carbide corporation union carbide  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past three decades 
these suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages 
the alleged claims primarily relate to products that union carbide sold in the past  alleged exposure to asbestos containing products located on union carbide s premises  and union carbide s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former union carbide subsidiary  amchem products  inc amchem 
in many cases  plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure  or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to union carbide s products 
influenced by the bankruptcy filings of numerous defendants in asbestos related litigation and the prospects of various forms of state and national legislative reform  the rate at which plaintiffs filed asbestos related suits against various companies  including union carbide and amchem  increased in  and the first half of the rate of filing significantly abated in the second half of union carbide expects more asbestos related suits to be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future  and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve  as appropriate  both pending and future claims 
the table below provides information regarding asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem claims unresolved at january    claims filed    claims settled  dismissed or otherwise resolved   claims unresolved at december    claimants with claims against both union carbide and amchem    individual claimants at december    in more than percent of the cases filed against union carbide and amchem  no specific amount of damages is alleged or  if an amount is alleged  it merely represents jurisdictional amounts or amounts to be proven at trial 
this percentage has been increasing with more recently filed cases 
even in those situations where specific damages are alleged  the claims frequently seek the same amount of damages  irrespective of the disease or injury 
plaintiffs lawyers often sue dozens or even hundreds of defendants in individual lawsuits on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of claimants 
as a result  even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury  those damages are not expressly identified as to union carbide  amchem or any other particular defendant 
in fact  there are no cases in which only union carbide and or amchem are the sole named defendants 
for these reasons and based upon union carbide s litigation and settlement experience  union carbide does not consider the damages alleged against union carbide and amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos liability 
as noted above  union carbide is typically only one of many named defendants  many of which  including union carbide and amchem  were members of the center for claims resolution ccr  an entity that defended and resolved asbestos cases on behalf of its members 
as members of the ccr  union carbide and amchem s strategy was to resolve the claims against them at the relatively small percentage allocated to them pursuant to the ccr s collective defense 
the ccr ceased operating in february  except to administer certain settlements 
union carbide then began using peterson asbestos claims enterprise  but only for claims processing and insurance invoicing 
certain members of dow s legal department and certain dow management personnel have been retained to provide their experience in mass tort litigation to assist union carbide in responding to asbestos related matters 
in early  union carbide hired new outside counsel to serve as national trial counsel 
in connection with these actions  aggressive defense strategies were designed to reduce the cost of resolving all asbestos related claims  including the elimination of claims that lack demonstrated illness or causality 
at the end of and through the third quarter of  union carbide had concluded it was not possible to estimate its cost of disposing of asbestos related claims that might be filed against union carbide and amchem in the future due to a number of reasons  including its lack of sufficient comparable loss history from which to assess either the number or value of future asbestos related claims 
during the third and fourth quarters of  union carbide worked with analysis  research planning corporation arpc  a consulting firm with broad experience in estimating resolution costs associated with mass tort litigation  including asbestos  to explore whether it would be possible to estimate the cost of disposing of pending and future asbestos related claims that have been  and could reasonably be expected to be  filed against union carbide and amchem 
union carbide provided arpc with all relevant data regarding asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem through november  arpc concluded that it was not possible to estimate the full range of the cost of resolving future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem because of various uncertainties associated with the litigation of those claims 
these uncertainties  which hindered arpc s ability to project future claim volumes and resolution costs  included the following until a series of bankruptcies led to the ccr ceasing operations in early  union carbide and amchem generally settled claims filed against ccr members according to a sharing formula that would not necessarily reflect the cost of resolving those claims had they been separately litigated against union carbide or amchem 
the bankruptcies in the years to of other companies facing large asbestos liability were a likely contributing cause of a sharp increase in filings against many defendants  including union carbide and amchem 
it was not until the ccr ceased operating in early that union carbide took direct responsibility for the defense of claims against itself and amchem 
new defense counsel for union carbide and amchem implemented more aggressive defense strategies in mid despite its inability to estimate the full range of the cost of resolving future asbestos related claims  arpc advised union carbide that it would be possible to determine an estimate of a reasonable forecast of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims likely to face union carbide and amchem  if certain assumptions were made 
specifically  arpc advised union carbide that for purposes of determining an estimate it is reasonable to assume that in the near term asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem are unlikely to return to levels below those experienced prior to when the recent spike in filings commenced and that average claim values are unlikely to return to levels below those experienced in  the years immediately following ccr s cessation of operations 
arpc advised union carbide that  by assuming that future filings would be at a level consistent with the levels experienced immediately prior to and extrapolating from and average claim values  arpc could make a reasonable forecast of the cost of resolving asbestos related claims facing union carbide and amchem 
arpc also advised union carbide that forecasts of resolution costs for a to year period from the date of the forecast are likely to be more accurate than forecasts for longer periods of time 
in projecting union carbide s resolution costs for future asbestos related claims  arpc applied two methodologies that have been widely used for forecasting purposes 
applying these methodologies  arpc forecast the number and allocation by disease category of those potential future claims on a year by year basis through arpc then calculated the percentage of claims in each disease category that had been closed with payments in and using those percentages  arpc calculated the number of future claims by disease category that would likely require payment by union carbide and amchem and multiplied the number of such claims by the mean values paid by union carbide and amchem  respectively  to dispose of such claims in and in estimating union carbide s cost of resolving pending claims  arpc used a process similar to that used for calculating the cost of resolving future claims 
in each instance  arpc s projections specifically assumed the following in the near term  the number of future claims to be filed against union carbide and amchem will be at a level consistent with levels experienced immediately prior to the number of future claims to be filed against union carbide and amchem will decline at a fairly constant rate each year from the percentage of claims settled by union carbide and amchem out of the total claims resolved whether by settlement or dismissal will be consistent with the percentage for and the average settlement value for pending and future claims will be equivalent to those experienced during and as of december   arpc estimated the undiscounted cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims against union carbide and amchem  excluding future defense and processing costs  for the year period from the present through to be between approximately billion and billion  depending on which of the two accepted methodologies was used 
although arpc provided estimates for a longer period of time  based on arpc s advice that forecasts for shorter periods of time are more accurate and in light of the uncertainties inherent in making long term projections  union carbide determined that the year period through was the reasonable time period for projecting the cost of disposing of its future asbestos related claims 
union carbide concluded that it was probable that the undiscounted cost of disposing of asbestos related pending and future claims ranged from billion to billion  which was the range for the year period ending in as estimated by arpc using both methodologies 
accordingly  union carbide increased its asbestos related liability for pending and future claims at december  to billion  excluding future defense and processing costs 
at december   approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims 
at each balance sheet date  union carbide compares current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the assumptions in the arpc study to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate 
in addition  in november  union carbide requested arpc to review the asbestos claim and resolution activity during and determine the appropriateness of updating its study 
in its response to that request  arpc reviewed and analyzed data through november  to determine the number of asbestos related filings and costs associated with activity 
in january  arpc stated that an update at this time would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than that reflected in its study of the previous year and  therefore  the estimate in that study remains applicable 
based on union carbide s own review of the current asbestos claim and resolution activity and arpc s response  union carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required at this time 
management noted  however  that the total number of claims filed in did exceed the number of claims assumed to be filed in the arpc study 
after consultation with outside counsel and other consultants  management believes this fact was strongly influenced by the pending national legislation and tort reform initiatives in key states 
the annual average resolution payment per asbestos claimant and the rate of new claim filings has fluctuated both up and down since the beginning of union carbide s management expects such fluctuations to continue in the future based upon the number and type of claims settled in a particular period  the jurisdictions in which such claims arose  and the extent to which any proposed legislative reform related to asbestos litigation is being considered 
at december   union carbide s asbestos related liability for pending and future claims was billion 
at december   approximately percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately percent related to future claims 
at december   union carbide increased the receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability to billion  substantially exhausting its asbestos product liability coverage 
combined with the previously mentioned increase in the asbestos related liability at december   this resulted in a net income statement impact to union carbide of million  million on an after tax basis  in the fourth quarter of the insurance receivable related to the asbestos liability was determined by union carbide after a thorough review of applicable insurance policies and the wellington agreement  to which union carbide and many of its liability insurers are signatory parties  as well as other insurance settlements  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  and taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers 
at december   union carbide s receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability was billion 
in addition  union carbide had receivables for defense and resolution costs submitted to insurance carriers for reimbursement as follows receivables for costs submitted to insurance carriers at december in millions receivables for defense costs receivables for resolution costs total the following table provides information regarding defense and resolution costs related to asbestos related claims filed against union carbide and amchem defense and resolution costs at december in millions defense costs for the year aggregate defense costs to date resolution costs for the year aggregate resolution costs to date union carbide s insurance policies generally provide coverage for asbestos liability costs  including coverage for both resolution and defense costs 
as previously noted  union carbide increased its receivable for insurance recoveries related to its asbestos liability at december   thereby recording the full favorable income statement impact of its insurance coverage in accordingly  defense and resolution costs recovered from insurers reduce union carbide s insurance receivable 
prior to increasing the insurance receivable related to the asbestos liability at december   the impact on union carbide s results of operations for defense costs was the amount of those costs not covered by insurance 
since union carbide expenses defense costs as incurred  defense costs for asbestos related litigation net of insurance have impacted  and will continue to impact  results of operations 
the pretax impact for defense and resolution costs  net of insurance  was million in  million in  and million in  and was reflected in cost of sales 
in september  union carbide filed a comprehensive insurance coverage case in the circuit court for kanawha county in charleston  west virginia  seeking to confirm its rights to insurance for various asbestos claims 
although union carbide already has settlements in place concerning coverage for asbestos claims with many of its insurers  including those covered by the wellington agreement  this lawsuit was filed against insurers that are not signatories to the wellington agreement and or do not otherwise have agreements in place with union carbide regarding their asbestos related insurance coverage 
union carbide continues to believe that its recorded receivable for insurance recoveries from all insurance carriers is collectible 
union carbide reached this conclusion after a further review of its insurance policies  with due consideration given to applicable deductibles  retentions and policy limits  after taking into account the solvency and historical payment experience of various insurance carriers  existing insurance settlements  and the advice of outside counsel with respect to the applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of its insurance policies 
the amounts recorded by union carbide for the asbestos related liability and related insurance receivable described above were based upon currently known facts 
however  projecting future events  such as the number of new claims to be filed each year  the average cost of disposing of each such claim  coverage issues among insurers  and the continuing solvency of various insurance companies  as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the united states  could cause the actual costs and insurance recoveries for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded 
because of the uncertainties described above  union carbide s management cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claims facing union carbide and amchem 
union carbide s management believes that it is reasonably possible that the cost of disposing of union carbide s asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material adverse impact on union carbide s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of union carbide 
it is the opinion of dow s management that it is reasonably possible that the cost of union carbide disposing of its asbestos related claims  including future defense costs  could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position of the company

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dow s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices 
to manage such risks effectively  the company enters into hedging transactions  pursuant to established guidelines and policies  which enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk 
derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  where appropriate 
a secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non specific exposure within established limits and policies  derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges per sfas no 
the potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the company s results 
the global nature of dow s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets 
as a result of investments  production facilities and other operations on a global basis  the company has assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary objective of the company s foreign exchange risk management is to optimize the us dollar value of net assets and cash flows  keeping the adverse impact of currency movements to a minimum 
to achieve this objective  the company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts  over the counter option contracts  cross currency swaps  and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies 
main exposures are related to assets and liabilities denominated in the currencies of europe  asia pacific and canada  bonds denominated in foreign currencies mainly the euro and japanese yen  and economic exposure derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the us dollar value of future cash flows 
the majority of the foreign exchange exposure is related to european currencies and the japanese yen 
the main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile 
dow uses interest rate swaps  swaptions  and exchange traded instruments to accomplish this objective 
the company s primary exposure is to the us dollar yield curve 
inherent in dow s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities 
some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments 
cracker feedstocks and natural gas constitute the main commodity exposures 
over the counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks when feasible 
dow has a portfolio of equity securities derived from its acquisition and divestiture activity 
this exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the company s market risk policies and procedures 
dow uses value at risk var  stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes 
var estimates the potential gain or loss in fair market values  given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time  using specified confidence levels 
on an ongoing basis  the company estimates the maximum gain or loss that could arise in one day  given a two standard deviation move in the respective price levels 
these amounts are relatively insignificant in comparison to the size of the equity of the company
