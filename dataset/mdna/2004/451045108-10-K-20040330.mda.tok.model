item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with selected financial data and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview paradigm genetics is a biotechnology company using proprietary systems biology to discover biomarkers to reduce cost  risk and time in the product development cycle as well as to discover inaccessible targets for small molecule discovery  both for our partners and for paradigm genetics 
we are growing our business by partnering with life sciences companies  while building our own portfolio of products 
additionally  we are leveraging our existing infrastructure to provide services that generate near term revenue 
in march  we acquired tissueinformatics 
inc  a privately held company  which develops and applies automated pathology software for the quantitative analysis of tissue changes in drug discovery  disease assessment  toxicology  and tissue engineering 
we believe this acquisition provides paradigm genetics with a unique competitive advantage as the first company to combine gene expression profiling  biochemical profiling and quantitative tissue analysis in a systems biology approach to life sciences discovery 
it is through this truly unique combination of different biological data that we can identify novel biomarkers and targets that were previously inaccessible due to biological noise 
our business model targets near term and mid term revenues and cash flow from our current commercial partnerships  government contracts and grants  new commercial partnerships and our service businesses paradigm array labs pal and tissueinformatics automated pathology software 
in the long term  we are targeting revenues and cash flow through the development of our proprietary product portfolio 
our current efforts are focused on developing diagnostics for liver disease and injury  biomarkers and drugs for diabetes and obesity  novel agricultural compounds as well as the development and application of automated pathology software 
commercial partnership revenue currently  we have several revenue generating partnerships and contracts 
the table below presents these revenue sources in millions potential contract value revenue recognized prior to revenues revenues revenues total revenue recognized remaining potential revenue to be recognized bayer monsanto atp grant niehs l or al pioneer dupont total includes potential milestone payments over the remaining term of the contracts and excludes potential royalties 
there can be no guarantee that we will achieve these revenues 

table of contents we currently have commercial partnerships with bayer crop sciences bayer in the area of crop production and with the monsanto company monsanto and pioneer hi bred international  inc pioneer  a subsidiary of dupont  in the area of crop trait discovery 
our partnership with bayer was signed in september and was extended in november under the terms of the agreement  the companies will collaborate on herbicide discovery through september the partnership with monsanto was signed in november and began contributing revenues in the second quarter of fiscal year during september  we announced that monsanto had amended the partnership agreement by eliminating its option to terminate the agreement without cause in exchange for broader commercialization rights 
this amendment commits monsanto to a total partnership term of six years with committed funding through january during november  we announced that the research plan under the commercial partnership with monsanto had been revised 
the revision only affected the fourth quarter of by slowing the timing of our revenue recognition 
this revision will not alter the total amount of revenue we will recognize over the term of this commercial partnership 
the partnership with pioneer was signed in december and began contributing to our revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year we also have a million five year contract with the national institute of environmental health sciences niehs that was signed in september and began contributing to our revenue in the fourth quarter of in april  the company announced that niehs exercised an million option under this contract bringing the total contact value to million 
under the terms of the contract we will use our technologies to determine how toxicants work and cause damage at the cellular level 
our acquisition of tissueinformatics 
inc brings revenue generating contracts  of which the most significant is the contract with l or al for the development and license of tissueinformatics software for the automated pathology slide screening of tissue engineered skin 
this contract was signed in november and will begin contributing to revenue in march of in addition  we have two government grants 
our advanced technology program atp grant from national institute of standards and technology nist was awarded in june for million over five years to develop innovative tools for target discovery through the analysis of complex coherent data sets 
this grant  the largest bioinformatics grant ever awarded in nist s advanced technologies program history  supports the development of methods and tools for the creation  evaluation and analysis of coherent data sets 
the grant will be shared between the joint venture partners  currently paradigm and lion bioscience a 
g  based on the research work plan 
we are expecting lion bioscience a 
g to step down as a joint venture partner and be replaced with an undisclosed party 
the other grant with the national science foundation nsf for the development of a high throughput gene discovery system in arabidopsis using geminivirus ended in june during the year ended december  we also generated revenues from another grant from nsf that ended in december during the year ended december   we also generated million in revenues from our commercial partnership with vddi pharmaceuticals that ended in december this revenue is included under the caption other revenue in the table above 
performance during  one of our major initiatives was to substantially reduce our cash burn rate 
we ended with million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments compared to million at december  this equates to a net use of cash and investments of million in compared to million in  a reduction of 
our cash position will continue to be a major focus in we may seek to further strengthen our cash position through additional financings involving either debt or the sale of our stock or both 
for further discussion of our cash position please see liquidity and capital resources below 

table of contents during  we set out to increase productivity gains  improve cost controls and gain traction by signing commercial deals  which would represent the acceptance and validation of our technology 
we achieved each of these goals  closing out a year of strong performance commercially  financially and strategically 
in  we signed numerous commercial partnerships  including an million option under our million contract with the niehs  increasing the total contract to million 
an extension of our commercial partnership with bayer  taking the collaboration through september of a small fungicide testing agreement with bayer 
a million  three year commercial partnership with pioneer hi bred international  inc  a subsidiary of dupont 
two healthcare proof of concept agreements  one with a well known biotechnology company and one with merck co 
inc we believe that these proof of concept deals will lead to larger research collaborations 
we also launched paradigm array labs  which capitalizes on our in house experience and knowledge base in microarray processing 
our success with regard to productivity gains and cost controls enabled us to redirect some of the savings towards the acceleration of our research and development programs in agriculture and healthcare 
financially  we signed a new debt agreement with silicon valley bank 
this agreement provided a million  four year term loan and a million line of credit 
we used approximately million of the proceeds from the term loan to pay off our equipment financing loan with transamerica technology finance  which was to mature in june we also actively worked to maintain our listing on the nasdaq national market 
strategically  we identified the acquisition of tissueinformatics 
inc as a key step to creating powerful and unique systems biology capabilities for life sciences discovery 
further we identified near term  mid term and long term revenue opportunities 
in the near term  we believe our paradigm array labs services business and automated pathology software offering will generate positive cash flow and revenue 
in both the near and mid term  the new commercial partnerships and contracts that we signed in provide good visibility on both cash flow and revenue 
in the long term  we believe that our programs for the development of diagnostics for liver disease and injury  biomarkers and drugs for diabetes and obesity  novel agricultural compounds and development and application of automated pathology software will lead to long term positive cash flow and revenue and ultimately  greater shareholder value 
the acquisition of tissueinformatics 
inc also added approximately million in cash to our balance sheet 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through the sale of common and preferred stock  debt and capital lease financing  payments received from commercial partnerships and government grants 
from our inception through december   we have raised an aggregate of approximately million in equity issues and approximately million in proceeds from secured debt financing 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling approximately million 
we currently see several factors which could negatively impact our cash position as a result of the secured debt agreement with silicon valley bank  we are obligated to maintain a quick ratio of at least 
the quick ratio is the ratio of the sum of cash  cash equivalents  short and long term investments and one half of accounts receivable to the sum of all current liabilities and all 
table of contents amounts owed to silicon valley bank minus our deferred revenue 
if we were to default on this financial covenant  we may be required to pay off the loan with silicon valley bank 
at december   the amount outstanding under our term loan with silicon valley bank was million 
we also had outstanding million under the revolving line of credit  which was repaid in january our quick ratio was as of december  as result of the equipment financing with general electric capital corporation  we have a negative covenant pledge agreement which will require us to restrict a portion of our cash if at the end of any quarter our unrestricted cash balance falls below the greater of million or nine months cash needs 
if we had triggered this covenant at december   the restriction would have been approximately  which is approximately fifty percent of the amount outstanding under this equipment financing arrangement 
our operations continue to use cash and will continue to do so some time 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in financial instruments with interest rates based on financial market conditions and as such we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
if we were required to pay off the loan with silicon valley bank and restrict cash under the loan covenants with general electric corporation  we believe our remaining cash would be sufficient to support our operations into please see the section entitled future cash commitments and outlook for below  for further details 
in order to best understand the company s cash flow  management believes that the cash flow measure presented below  which includes short term and long term investments  is an appropriate measure for evaluating the company s liquidity  because this reflects all liquid resources available for strategic opportunities including  among others  to invest in the business and continue operating activities 
however this measure should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  cash flows  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us in millions net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities  excluding purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments net cash provided by used in financing activities net decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  beginning of period cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  end of period cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments exclude restricted cash 
see reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles gaap below 
cash used in operating activities in  cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of operating losses and a decrease in deferred revenue offset  in part  by the add back of non cash expenses primarily depreciation and stock based compensation and positive changes in other working capital balances as a result of improved cash management activities 
deferred revenue consists of payments made by monsanto offset by the revenue we recognize under this commercial partnership 
improved cash management activities include

in cash used in operating activities primarily consisted of operating losses  increased accounts receivable balances  a decrease in deferred revenue and lower accrued and other liabilities offset  in part  by the add back of non cash expenses primarily depreciation and stock based compensation 
accounts receivable increases primarily comprised of the bayer receivable  which went from a deferred revenue position at december  of million to a receivable position of million at december  deferred revenue at december  consists of payments made by monsanto offset by the revenue we recognize under this commercial partnership 
we expect our cash from operating activities will improve slightly in when compared to  as we are expecting new revenues in to contribute to our cash flow from operations offset  in part  by higher research and development costs from our expanding research programs  see outlook for below 
no assurance can be given that we will earn the new revenues anticipated in cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of investments in laboratory and data processing equipment for our genefunction factory  our biochemical profiling  and phenotypic analysis platforms and also in leasehold improvements 
the need for capital equipment has declined over the last two years 
we expect our cash used in investing activities will increase in compared to as we continue to make investments in the purchase of equipment to support our operations 
cash provided by used in financing activities in  cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of the receipt of approximately million from our financing with silicon valley bank of which we used approximately million to pay off our equipment financing with one financial institution  which carried higher interest rates 
we also drew down approximately million from the revolving line of credit with silicon valley bank  which was repaid in january in addition  we had net repayments under our notes payable for equipment financing of approximately million 
in  cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of net repayments under our notes payable for equipment financing in accordance with the debt agreements 
we paid off our senior term loan of million and had net repayments under our notes payable for equipment financing of approximately million

no assurance can be given that such additional financings will be available or  if available  can be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
reconciliation to gaap under gaap  cash flows from investing activities above would improve by net maturities of investment securities and unrealized gains and losses on investments  also under gaap  cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the period would be less  as they would exclude short and long term investments

table of contents notes we recognize revenues relating to our partnership with bayer in two components  gene discovery and assay development 
for the gene discovery component  from which the majority of the revenue is generated  we recognize revenue by comparing the number of genes analyzed to the total number of genes to be analyzed 
as this contract has entered its later phases  there is a corresponding decrease in the number of genes analyzed 
therefore  the revenue associated with the gene discovery component has declined 
for the assay component  we recognize revenue when bayer accepts assays 
there was no significant difference in revenues related to assays in compared to the combined result is a decrease in the total revenue recognized for bayer in when compared to we expect the trend in both the gene discovery component and the assay component to continue in we recognize revenues relating to our partnership with monsanto by comparing the number of genes analyzed to the total number of genes to be analyzed 
during  we announced that the research plan under this partnership had been revised 
the revision to the research plan slowed the timing of our revenue recognition during the fourth quarter  and thus lowered the total revenue recognized for therefore we see an increase in total revenue for monsanto in when compared to we expect that revenues related to this commercial partnership will decline in when compared to as the project enters later phases in which there is a decrease in the number of genes analyzed 
we recognize revenues relating to our partnership with niehs as samples are processed 
in  revenues increased as a result of the continued ramp up in the number of samples processed under this contract 
we expect this ramp up to continue in and  as a result  we expect revenues will increase in when compared to we recognize revenues under our grants as the related expenses are incurred 
grant revenues for the year ended december  were generated from our atp grant and one grant with nsf 
grant revenues for the year ended december  were generated from our atp grant and two grants with nsf 
the revenue increase between and is primarily related to our atp grant 
we are expecting that our grant revenues will remain flat in when compared to  due to revenues from our atp grant increasing in offset  in part  by decreases in our grant revenue from nsf as the last grant ended in june other revenues in were primarily comprised of a one time service contract compared to when other revenues were primarily comprised of revenue from our commercial partnership with vddi pharmaceuticals which ended in december we expect that other revenues will increase in when compared to as we begin to recognize more revenues from our pal service business

laboratory supply costs increased approximately million from as we ramped up the work on our contract with niehs 
other expenses  which consist primarily of facilities costs  corporate support costs and licenses fees  decreased by approximately million as a result of our continued cost control initiatives 
we are expecting our payroll  lab supply and other expenses to increase in when compared to as we continue to expand our services under our contract with niehs  expand our healthcare business and deliver on our new contract with pioneer hi bred 
in march  we completed the acquisition of tissueinformatics 
inc  which will also add to our payroll  lab supply and other expenses 
total depreciation expense decreased in when compared to this was due to some of our assets being fully depreciated and purchasing less capital equipment in than in prior years 
we expect this trend to continue in when compared to total stock based compensation expense increased in when compared to  primarily due to the granting of  shares of common stock as part of bonuses 
during we accrued million in additional stock based compensation expense related to these stock bonuses as the shares of common stock were issued in june we expect that stock based compensation expense will decrease substantially in when compared to as the amount of deferred compensation remaining to be expensed is minimal 
our costs in declined when compared to  a year in which our operations were reorganized to better enable us to focus our resources on our core business opportunities

divestiture we are reporting a small loss from discontinued operations in in november  we decided to discontinue the operations of our plant genotyping business  paragen and in february we sold paragen  to dna landmarks 
in  we reported the operating losses from paragen and the related write off of goodwill and associated assets to fair value less costs to sell  as a loss from discontinued operations of million 
we are expecting a minimal income contribution from discontinued operations as we recognize royalties from the sale during we purchased paragen in from celera for  shares of our common stock  which were subsequently registered for resale on an s registration statement 
interest income expense  net interest income expense  net represents interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments  offset by interest expense on long term debt and capital leases 
interest income expense net  increased to an expense of approximately  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to a reduction in interest earned on our cash balances offset  in part  by a decrease in our interest expense 
we expect that net interest expense will continue to increase as we use our cash balances to fund our operations and service our debt 

table of contents net loss net loss decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss was primarily due to increased revenues between the two periods  lower research and development costs  lower selling  general and administrative costs and decreased losses from discontinued operations related to paragen

deferred compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the related stock options  which is generally four years 
the reason that stock based compensation expense decreased is that as individuals leave the employ of paradigm the deferred compensation related to unvested options is no longer recognized as an expense 
our costs in declined when compared to this expense decrease was primarily due to a one time charge that we recorded in related to an acquisition that we ceased pursuing

outlook for we ended with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that this cash balance will be sufficient to support our operations into  however  we will continue to pursue opportunities to increase our liquidity 
to accomplish this we will consider additional financing involving debt  the sale of our stock or both 
we believe that we will continue to see increased receptivity for our technologies in the market place as evidenced by the two proof of concept deals and the commercial partnership with pioneer hi bred international  inc  which we signed in also the acquisition of tissueinformatics 
inc brings in key technologies that strengthen our systems biology capabilities 
we believe that the strengthening of our offering  the addition of key people and the strengthened product pipeline from tissueinformatics 
inc will lead to an enhanced revenue stream in the cost controls and productivity gains achieved in will continue to be a focal point in we will continue to look for opportunities to redirect resources to accelerate and expand our research and development programs toward both the agriculture and healthcare markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most significant estimates that management makes with respect to our financial statements is the progress to completion under our long term commercial contracts 
we currently recognize revenue based on a comparison of the number of genes analyzed to the total number of genes to be analyzed  on a contract by contract basis 
we track the number of genes analyzed through our computer systems 
if these computer systems were to incorrectly count the number of genes analyzed our revenues may be impacted 
alternatively  if we were to incorrectly estimate the number of genes to be analyzed in order to complete our commercial contracts  our future revenues may be impacted

potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
factors that could cause these fluctuations include the timing of the initiation  progress or cancellation of commercial partnerships the mix of work performed for our commercial partners in a particular period the timing of internal expansion costs  and the timing and amount of costs associated with evaluating and integrating acquisitions  if any 
fluctuations in quarterly results or other factors beyond our control could affect the market price of our common stock 
such factors include changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in our industry  changes in pharmaceutical  agri chemical  and biotechnology industries  and general economic conditions 
any effect on our common stock could be unrelated to our longer term operating performance 
forward looking statements our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and other statements contained in this report are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from existing revenue sources will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
it is possible that we may seek additional funding within this time frame 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that additional funding  if sought  will be available or  even if available  will be available on terms favorable to us 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and progress of our research programs the achievement of the milestones under certain of our existing commercial partnerships our ability to establish additional and maintain current and additional commercial partnerships our commercial partners success in commercializing products developed under our commercial partnership agreements our success in commercializing products to which we have retained the rights under our commercial partnerships the costs incurred in enforcing and defending our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our products
