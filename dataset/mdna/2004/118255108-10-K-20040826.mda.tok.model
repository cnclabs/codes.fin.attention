item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition md a summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and contractual obligations  as well as discussing our critical accounting policies 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other sections of this annual report on form k 
our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  financial condition and critical accounting policies 
executive summary buckeye technologies inc and its subsidiaries manufacture value added cellulose based specialty products in the united states  canada  germany  and brazil and sell these products in approximately countries worldwide 
we generate revenues  operating income and cash flows from two reporting segments  specialty fibers and nonwoven materials 
specialty fibers are derived from wood and cotton cellulose materials using wetlaid technologies 
our nonwoven materials are derived from wood pulps  synthetic fibers and other materials using an airlaid process 
see item business for a more detailed description of these segments and processes 
our strategy is to continue to strengthen our position as a leading supplier of cellulose based specialty products 
we believe that we can continue to expand market share  improve profitability and decrease our exposure to cyclical downturns by pursuing the following strategic objectives focus on technically demanding niche markets  develop and commercialize innovative proprietary products  strengthen long term alliances with customers  provide our products at an attractive value  and significantly reduce our debt 
while we operated at a loss in fiscal  we made progress on strategic initiatives which we believe will strengthen both our specialty fibers and nonwoven materials businesses and position us for future growth 
in the specialty fibers segment  we completed the partial closure of the lumberton facility last summer and transferred all of our production of specialty paper cotton cellulose to our facilities located at memphis  tennessee and at glueckstadt  germany 
although we experienced some short term disruptions while transitioning to memphis and glueckstadt  we have since mastered the new processes and are now producing specialty cotton cellulose for these niche paper markets at an even better quality than the products we manufactured at lumberton 
importantly  we now are benefiting from the economies of scale of having increased our cotton cellulose capacity utilization percentage 
we have also taken an important step in further developing our capability to supply a wide range of products based on cotton cellulose to customers worldwide by initiating an million project to upgrade the capability of our americana  brazil manufacturing facility 
because brazil benefits from low manufacturing costs and a large and increasing raw material supply  we are confident that  when this conversion is completed in the fall of  it will be a significant contributor to our profitability 
we improved the product mix of our wood based specialty fibers by transferring a portion of our wood cellulose production away from fluff pulp into higher value chemical applications 
the closure of a competitor s specialty wood pulp production facility  in july  effectively removed of the high end specialty wood pulp capacity from the market 
we capitalized on this closure by devoting more of our foley wood pulp mill to the production and sale of high end specialty fibers and less to fluff pulp 
during fiscal year  fluff pulp accounted for of our sales 
in fiscal  this percentage was reduced to 
while the market for fluff pulp has recently shown improvement  we believe that over the long run we will be better served by having more of our production in high value specialty grades and a smaller exposure to the volatile fluff pulp market 
in the nonwoven materials segment  we made the decision to cease production at our single line cork  ireland facility 
the plant ceased production in july of this closure will enable us to increase the capacity utilization rate at our three larger dual line facilities  thereby improving our cost structure 
the benefits of the cork closure  which should improve earnings by over million annually and reduce working capital requirements by about million  will be realized over the course of fiscal in the fall of  as part of our strategy to improve our debt structure  we successfully refinanced our near term debt by issuing million in senior notes which have an interest rate of and amending our bank credit facility  which now consists of a million revolving credit line and a million term loan 
the senior notes mature in and the revolving credit line and term loan mature in and  respectively 
we have no significant mandatory debt reductions before while we are not faced with the requirement to retire our debt quickly  we have continued to focus on debt reduction because we believe strengthening our balance sheet is important to our business 
during the past fiscal year  we used cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash on hand as well as cash from operations to reduce our debt from million to million  a reduction of million 
at the same time  we reduced our cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash on hand by million to million 
we have reduced our debt million since it reached its high point at the end of calendar we intend to make further debt reductions during fiscal results of operations consolidated results the following table compares consolidated net sales  operating income loss  and impairment and restructuring costs for the three years ended june millions year ended june change percent change net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  research and administrative expenses impairment and restructuring costs operating income loss n a net sales growth in fiscal was due to strong performance by the nonwoven materials segment  primarily the result of increased volume and the strengthening of the euro 
the increase in nonwoven materials sales was only slightly offset by a decline in net sales of specialty fibers products 
cost of goods sold increased at a faster rate than sales due primarily to higher manufacturing costs at some of our specialty fibers plants due to unusual events and special situations discussed further in segment results specialty fibers of this md a 
the net sales increase in fiscal was attributed to higher volume and sales prices for fluff pulp and airlaid nonwoven materials  partially offset by a decline in cotton cellulose sales prices in fiscal from unusually high levels in fiscal we experienced an operating loss in that was primarily the result of million of restructuring and impairment costs related to the closure of our cork  ireland facility and other organizational restructuring 
also contributing to the loss were increases in selling  research and administrative expenses which were primarily the result of an increase in bad debt expense of million due to the bankruptcy of a large customer discussed further in segment results specialty fibers of this md a 
operating income was also negatively impacted by impairment and restructuring charges in fiscal years and further discussion on the revenue and operating trends and impairment and restructuring costs are discussed in the segment results of this md a 
additional information on the impairment and restructuring charges taken in each of the three fiscal years may be found in note and note of the consolidated financial statements 
segment results although nonwoven materials  processes  customers  distribution methods and regulatory environment are very similar to specialty fibers  we believe it is appropriate for nonwoven materials to be disclosed as a separate reporting segment from specialty fibers 
the specialty fiber segment is an aggregation of cellulosic fibers based on both wood and cotton 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the sales and operating income of each segment 
we allocate selling  research  and administration expense to each segment and we use the resulting operating income to measure the performance of the segments 
we exclude items that are not included in measuring business performance  such as restructuring costs  asset impairment and certain financing and investing costs 
specialty fibers the following table compares specialty fibers net sales and operating income for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income the decrease in net sales of million during fiscal was due primarily to lower selling prices and mix changes for our cotton based products and lower unit wood volume  partially offset by improvements in selling prices and mix of wood based products 
sales price increases and decreases for cotton based products are influenced by the variability in the cost and supply of cotton fibers 
as the cost of these fibers fell during calendar  we reduced our sales prices 
our cotton sales prices did not recover until calendar year total cotton volume increased by in fiscal  but a change in mix reduced the average selling price 
sales volume at our americana  brazil facility  increased by in fiscal  which contributed to the mix change as the selling price of this product is significantly lower due to our tolling arrangement with the customer 
we recently implemented additional price increases averaging approximately on most of our cotton based specialty products 
although we expect this increase to have a positive impact on revenue and operating income during fiscal  it primarily will offset higher costs 
improvements in selling prices and mix of our wood based products were driven by several complementing factors 
overall strengthening of the economy increased the demand for pulp and paper products  driving up commodity pulp prices 
while our average fluff pulp price increased by during fiscal  we can offer no assurances that this increase in fluff pulp pricing will continue or that it will not reverse direction during fiscal continued weakening of the us dollar made our products more attractive to export customers 
additionally  market supply constraints caused by the closure of one of the world s largest dissolving wood cellulose mills in calendar significantly tightened the market for high purity dissolving wood pulps 
as a result of the tightening of our markets  we are continuing to capitalize on opportunities to significantly reduce our shipments of fluff pulp and increase our shipments of high purity dissolving wood pulps 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal was due to lower selling prices on cotton based products being only partially offset by slightly higher unit volumes and the restart of operations at our americana facility 
as the cost of cotton fibers increased in we increased our sales prices 
as these costs fell during fiscal we reduced our sales prices 
during fiscal our selling prices decreased by approximately  while in fiscal they increased by approximately 
fluff pulp prices vary with market conditions 
during fiscal  our average fluff pulp price increased by versus fiscal operating income for the year ended june  decreased by from the same period in the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of several additional charges related to unusual events and special situations discussed below lenzing fibers  a specialty fibers customer which owes us million  filed for chapter reorganization bankruptcy during the quarter ended december  based on an evaluation of the potential to recover this debt from our customer  we established a reserve of million during the quarter ended december  based on new information that became available during the quarter ended march   we reevaluated our allowance for bad debt for lenzing fibers and increased the allowance to or million of the outstanding balance 
the reserve represents our best estimate at this time for the amounts we may not recover as a result of this customer s bankruptcy 
we cannot offer any assurance to the timing of our recovery  if any  of the lenzing receivable 
during the first half of fiscal  we conducted an extended maintenance shutdown at our perry  florida wood pulp mill 
this extended shutdown was the first in five years and impacted cost of goods sold by million 
historically  we accrued expenses related to extended maintenance shutdowns  but as of july   we changed our method of accounting from the accrue in advance method to the direct expense method 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in addition to the increased charges for the maintenance shutdown  we incurred high manufacturing costs and reduced production at both our perry  florida wood pulp mill and our memphis  tennessee cotton cellulose facility during the quarter ended december  the poor operating results were related to maintenance work completed in october at each location 
the perry  florida plant had difficulty reestablishing stable operations following the maintenance shutdown  and the memphis plant was impacted by the startup of new equipment and processes associated with the production of paper grade products previously produced at the recently closed lumberton cotton cellulose plant 
both plants have now returned to normal operations 
on october   the union at our perry  florida plant  ratified a new labor agreement effective through march  the agreement included a one time retroactive payment of approximately million 
operating income during fiscal was also negatively impacted by currency driven manufacturing cost increases at our glueckstadt  germany cotton facility due to the weakening of the us dollar 
all of these decreases were partially offset by a more favorable specialty wood pulp sales mix  higher specialty wood pulp prices  and operating the americana  brazil facility at capacity for the entire year ending june  operating income for fiscal improved million over fiscal this improvement in operating income reflected modestly higher fluff pulp pricing  a more favorable dissolving wood pulp sales mix  operating the americana facility for most of the year  and operating expense reductions 
these improvements were partially offset by lower margins for cotton based products  increased energy and chemicals costs  a write down in the value of cotton raw material  and the impact of a strengthening euro on the operating costs of our facility in glueckstadt  germany 
we restarted manufacturing at our americana facility in july this facility manufactures chemical cellulose and distributes it to a single customer 
the americana facility had been idled previously due to the high cost of cotton linters 
in fiscal  we agreed with our customer to extend the initial volume agreement 
we anticipate that this extension agreement will provide sufficient volume to enable the plant to continue to operate at full capacity through calendar year we have negotiated a further extension to provide sufficient volume through september nonwoven materials the following table compares nonwoven materials net sales and operating income loss for the three years ended june  millions year ended june change percent change net sales operating income loss n a our increase in net sales in fiscal was primarily due to a increase in shipment volume and the strengthening of the euro versus the us dollar 
these improvements were partially offset by minor price and mix changes 
net sales in fiscal increased primarily due to increased shipments and the strengthening of the euro 
our improvement in operating income in fiscal reflects the increase in sales volume previously discussed 
additionally  improved waste  reliability and other cost reductions along with the favorable net impact of changes in exchange rates offset some modest selling price reductions  unfavorable changes to product mix and increases in raw material prices 
our gaston  north carolina facility improved its operating performance compared to the prior year as we were able to increase production volume while at the same time reducing site overhead and realizing significant improvements in waste  run rates and reliability 
reduced waste  other cost reductions and the strengthening of the euro improved operating results at our steinfurt  germany facility 
at our delta  british columbia  canada facility the weakening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar more than offset the increases in production and shipment volume 
our cork facility recorded improved earnings performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense after the facility s fixed assets were impaired at the end of the third quarter 
for further discussion of this closure see note and note of the consolidated financial statements 
as noted in the previous paragraph  the weakening of the us dollar against both the euro and canadian dollar had opposite impacts on operating results at our foreign facilities 
this inconsistency is caused by the pricing of our products in multiple currencies 
the vast majority of sales for steinfurt  germany are denominated in euros or other european currencies while a portion of their raw material purchases are denominated in us dollars 
as the euro strengthened  steinfurt s cost of goods sold increased at a slightly slower rate than sales revenues when translated into us dollars  resulting in an increase to steinfurt s gross margin 
at our delta  british columbia  canada facility nearly all of our sales are in us dollars while the labor and overhead costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
in this case  as the canadian dollar strengthened  delta s gross margin was compressed 
during fiscal  nonwoven materials operating income improved by approximately million as a result of the net impact of these currency changes 
operating income in fiscal increased compared to the prior year s operating loss 
our improvement reflected reductions in waste and other costs 
restructuring and impairment activities during the three years ended june   we entered into various restructuring programs  which resulted in restructuring and impairment charges 
in order to continue to provide both specialty fibers and nonwoven materials at attractive values  we will continue to look for ways to reduce costs and optimize our operating structure 
the following table summarizes restructuring expense by program and impairment charges for the three years ended june  following the table is an explanation of the programs and the resulting impairment charges 
for further explanation of these charges  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
estimate to complete year ended june total at june  estimated millions charges impairment charges restructuring costs restructuring program restructuring program phase restructuring program phase restructuring program total restructuring costs restructuring program and impairments during march of  our board of directors approved the discontinuation of production of nonwoven materials at our cork  ireland facility 
while the demand for nonwoven products is growing in the low to mid single digits  the growth in demand has not been sufficient to fully utilize existing capacity 
as such  industry participants have been rationalizing production by taking down time  reducing operating shifts and closing facilities 
due to excess production capacity around the globe  we have operated cork below its productive capacity since the plant started up in because of its location and small size  our cost to produce at cork is higher than it is at our other locations 
after careful consideration of all the options available  management reached the decision to close the cork facility and consolidate production at our three other manufacturing facilities 
production at cork ceased in july of closing our cork facility reduced our nonwovens capacity by about 
we will continue to meet customer needs for nonwoven materials by producing these products at our facilities in delta  british columbia  canada  steinfurt  germany  and gaston county  north carolina 
we expect this consolidation will enable us to improve our overall nonwoven materials operating results by about million annually and reduce working capital needs by million 
the closure of the cork facility will result in the termination of employees 
we expect restructuring expenses and payments related to the closure to be approximately million of which million has been incurred and with the remaining million to occur over the remainder of calendar our commitment to discontinue production represented an indicator of impairment and subsequently we evaluated the value of the property  plant  and equipment associated with the cork facility 
we determined that these long lived assets  with a carrying amount of million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million  resulting in an impairment charge of million 
during fiscal  we also impaired certain equipment and other capitalized costs of million 
restructuring programs phase and phase and impairments in april  we announced the discontinuation of production of cotton linter pulp at our specialty fibers lumberton  north carolina facility due to the decline in demand for cotton content paper 
we completed this partial closure in august and continue to produce cosmetic cotton products at the lumberton site 
this decision reflects a steady decline in demand in the cotton fiber paper industry  which has contracted by about one third since the late s 
while cotton linter pulp is one of our core businesses  current demand did not economically justify operating a facility that could only produce products for paper applications 
to better meet our customers needs  we consolidated our us cotton linter pulp production at our larger memphis  tennessee and glueckstadt  germany facilities 
in conjunction with the consolidation  we initiated the first phase of a restructuring program designed to deliver cost reductions through reduced expenses across the company  the main component of which was the partial closure of our lumberton  north carolina facility 
this phase of restructuring resulted in the elimination of approximately positions within the specialty fibers segment 
the resulting increase in facility utilization is enabling us to improve our operating results by over million annually 
this more efficient operating configuration began to reduce our cost of goods sold beginning in january this closure reduced our working capital needs by approximately million 

as part of the closure  we evaluated the ongoing value of the property  plant and equipment associated with the lumberton facility 
we determined that long lived assets property  plant and equipment with a carrying amount of million were impaired and wrote them down to their estimated fair value of million 
the resulting impairment charge of million is reflected in the statement of operations during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a second phase of this restructuring program 
this phase of the program will enable us to improve our operating results by approximately million annually through reduced salaries  benefits  other employee related expenses and operating expenses 
as a result of this restructuring  positions are being eliminated 
these positions include manufacturing  sales  product development and administrative functions throughout the organization 
the full benefit of this restructuring will not be realized until the end of calendar we expect payments related to this phase of the restructuring program to continue into calendar and expect costs to total approximately million 
restructuring program and impairments during fiscal  we entered into a restructuring program designed to deliver cost reductions through reduced overhead expenses 
the cost recorded comprised mainly of severance and employee benefit costs  was million and was recorded in fiscal as a result of the restructuring  approximately positions were eliminated  which reduced our costs by over million annually 
as part of the restructuring  we closed engineering offices located in finland 
this cost reduction program impacted our nonwovens and specialty fibers businesses in north america and europe 
all payments for the program were completed as of june  during fiscal  we recorded impairment costs of million 
these impairments were primarily related to obsolete airlaid nonwovens packaging equipment that was replaced with more efficient stacpac tm packaging lines 
net interest expense and amortization of debt costs we incurred net interest expense and amortization of debt costs of million in fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the consistency is the result of several offsetting factors 
lower interest rates and average debt levels during fiscal offset both the negative impact of the termination of the interest rate swap and the additional expense of holding the million of senior subordinated notes due and the million of senior notes due concurrently for days during the first half of fiscal net interest and amortization of debt costs were million lower in fiscal compared to million incurred in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates in fiscal  which were partially offset by million of interest capitalization in fiscal loss on early extinguishment of debt costs on september   we placed privately million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due october  the notes are unsecured obligations and are senior to any of our subordinated debt 
the notes are guaranteed by our direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries that are also guarantors on our senior secured indebtedness 
we used the net proceeds from the private placement to redeem our million senior subordinated notes due as a result of the extinguishment  million was expensed during the first quarter of fiscal these expenses included a million call premium and million related to the write off of deferred financing costs 
see note  debt  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the debt issuance and related extinguishment 
foreign exchange  amortization of intangibles and other foreign exchange  amortization of intangibles and other expense in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to the absence of expenses related to the settlement of a lawsuit and the negative impact of a natural gas forward contract recognized in fiscal  partially offset by lower foreign currency gains 
the million favorable variance in fiscal from was due primarily to an increase of million in foreign currency gains partially offset by the lawsuit settlement and the natural gas forward contract 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was versus in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease in fiscal and the increase in were primarily attributable to the utilization of a foreign net operating loss carryforward in fiscal that had previously been fully reserved 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a net tax benefit of million resulting from changes in estimates used in our prior year end tax provision compared to the actual amounts utilized in filing our tax return 
for further information on income taxes see note in the consolidated financial statements 
cumulative effect of change in accounting planned maintenance activities historically  we accrued expenses related to extended maintenance shutdowns at our perry  florida facility 
however  as of july   we changed our method of accounting from the accrue in advance method to the direct expense method 
the effect of applying the new method for the year ended june  is a decrease in net loss of million 
this decrease in net loss is composed of a profit increase of million pre tax million net of tax reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change  offset by million million net of tax in additional cost of goods sold which was the cost of the planned maintenance activity performed in see note  changes in accounting  in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this change in accounting 
goodwill effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 which established new accounting and reporting requirements for goodwill and other intangible assets as described in our critical accounting policies 
based on our assessment  effective july  we reduced our goodwill by million in the converting business  which we had purchased in the merfin acquisition in we recorded no tax benefit as a result of the reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
financial condition our financial condition improved during the current fiscal year 
we are committed to reducing our debt  strengthening our operations and continuing to improve our profitability and cash flow 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended june   and  we provided cash from operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in fiscal was primarily due to a targeted decrease in inventories and decreased accounts receivable 
approximately million of the accounts receivable decrease was a permanent reduction due to a change in our cash management strategy  as we began discounting large letters of credit  enabling us to reduce our debt and interest costs 
these improvements in cash from operating activities were partially offset by lower accounts payable and the expenditures at our foley plant for a planned maintenance shutdown 
the million improvement in fiscal cash flow was due to a million increase in operating results before the effect of certain non cash charges a change in accounting and impairment of long lived assets 
additionally  reductions in inventories and the receipt of an million federal tax refund  that reduced prepaid expenses  contributed to the improved cash flows from operations in fiscal these improvements were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to a change in the terms of a supply contract with a significant customer 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal  we used million cash in investing activities  as compared to million in fiscal the increase of million in fiscal was primarily due to the absence of redemptions of short term investments which occurred in fiscal and the expenditure at our foley plant for a planned maintenance shutdown and capital expenditures at our memphis tennessee facility to provide the capability to manufacture cotton cellulose products previously manufactured at our lumberton  north carolina facility 
in fiscal  we reduced the cash used in investing activities by million 
million of the reduction was due to the redemption of short term investments in fiscal that had been purchased in fiscal the remaining decrease in fiscal was due to continued efforts to reduce capital expenditures and the lack of any major construction or projects during the year 
overall  we used cash to make capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  we made these expenditures primarily to construct  purchase  modernize and upgrade our production equipment and facilities 
a large portion of our capital expenditures in fiscal related to the foley plant planned maintenance shutdown and the transfer of cotton cellulose paper products  that were previously manufactured at our lumberton plant  to our memphis plant 
we expect to increase capital expenditures in fiscal by about million  primarily related to the upgrade of our americana facility 
net cash provided by used in financing activities in fiscal  we restructured our debt position by eliminating debt that came due in calendar we redeemed our million senior subordinated notes due and made a permanent reduction on our revolving credit facility by issuing million of senior notes due in addition  we established a million senior secured credit facility of which million matures in and million matures in this facility amended our revolving credit facility due in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in fiscal  we used cash to repay million in debt including a million note payment to upm kymmene in connection with the purchase of walkisoft 
in may  we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering were million 
we also used additional borrowings under our bank credit facilities along with the cash provided by operating activities to make our million note payment to upm kymmene 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
under this authorization  we will hold the repurchased shares as treasury stock and such shares will be available for general corporate purposes  including the funding of employee benefit and stock related plans 
in fiscal  we repurchased no shares of our common stock 
through june   we had repurchased a total of  shares under the current board authority 
at june   we were prohibited from repurchasing our common stock under the terms of our senior secured credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations as of june  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in millions payments due by period less than greater than contractual obligations total year years years years long term obligations capital lease obligations 
operating leases timber commitments lint commitments other purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations  amounts include related interest payments 
interest payments for variable debt of million are based on the effective rate as of june  of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on interest rates 
capital lease obligations represent principal and interest payments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
lint commitments are take or pay contracts made in the ordinary course of business that usually are less than one year in length 
the majority of other purchase commitments are take or pay contracts made in the ordinary course of business related to utilities and raw material purchases 
liquidity and capitalization we have the following major sources of financing senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
our senior secured credit facility  senior notes and senior subordinated notes contain various covenants 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of june  and believe we will remain in compliance 
these sources of financing are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our total debt decreased to million at june  from million at june   a decrease of million 
from june  to june   total debt decreased by million 
our total debt as a percentage of our total capitalization was at june  as compared to at june  and at june  on june   we had million borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility 
the portion of this capacity that we could borrow will depend on our financial results and ability to comply with certain borrowing conditions under the revolving credit facility 
as of june   our liquidity  including available borrowings and cash and cash equivalents was approximately million 
management believes this is sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the business 
we believe we will continue to have positive cash flow and this potential limitation is not an issue 
under our senior secured credit facility  we are required to make a payment on our term loan for of our excess cash flow as defined under the credit agreement  based on the fiscal year 
this payment  of approximately million  was made during july and august of shelf registration 
on march   we filed a form s shelf registration statement 
by its terms  the shelf registration statement allows us to issue from time to time various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  up to an aggregate amount of million 
we filed the registration statement to gain additional flexibility in accessing capital markets for general corporate purposes 
this s registration statement became effective on april  on may   we sold  shares of common stock under this registration statement at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering were million 
we used these proceeds for general corporate purposes 
we have no plans to issue any additional securities at this time 
while we can offer no assurances  we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with current cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund necessary capital expenditures  meet operating expenses and service our debt obligations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our critical and significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates underlying our financial statements requires the exercise of management s judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
our management exercises critical judgment in the application of our accounting policies in the following areas  which significantly affect our financial condition and results of operation 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent auditors 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for receivables we believe we may not collect in full 
management evaluates the collectibility of accounts based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations ie  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material amount 
during fiscal  a significant customer filed for bankruptcy protection 
as a result of this change in circumstances  we recorded an increase in our estimate for bad debts of million 
historically  bad debt expense for fiscal years  and have been million  million and million  respectively 
deferred income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax law treatment of certain items 
realization of certain components of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
these valuation allowances can be impacted by changes in tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels and are based on our judgment  estimates and assumptions regarding those events 
in fiscal  we utilized a million foreign net operating loss carryforward that had been fully reserved  in fiscal  we realized a million benefit in canada and in fiscal  we realized a million benefit in germany  both due to changes in tax laws 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance through a charge to income in the period that such determination is made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  in excess of the net carrying amounts  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through an increase to income in the period that such determination is made 
depreciation we provide for depreciation on our production machinery and equipment at our cotton cellulose and airlaid nonwovens plants using the units of production depreciation method 
under this method  we calculate depreciation based on the expected total productive hours of the assets and  in any case  subject to a minimum level of depreciation 
we review our estimate of total productive hours at least annually 
if the estimated productive hours of these assets change based on changes in utilization and useful life assumptions  we adjust depreciation expense per unit of production accordingly 
we use the straight line method for determining depreciation on our other capital assets 
during fiscal  based on changes in utilization estimates  we increased depreciation expense by million 
we had no changes in estimates or assumptions during fiscal or inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the market price of our inventory is subject to variation 
during periods when market prices decline below net book value  we may need to provide an allowance to reduce the carrying value of our inventory 
in addition  certain items in inventory may be considered obsolete 
we may establish an allowance to reduce the carrying value of those items to their net realizable value 
changes in these estimates related to the value of inventory  if any  may result in a materially adverse impact on our reported financial position or results of operations 
we recognize the impact of any changes in estimates  assumptions and judgments in income in the period in which it is determined 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for assets that are held and used  recoverability is evaluated based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of the assets are determined not be recoverable  then an impairment is recognized when the fair value associated with the asset group is less than the carrying value 
if impairment exists  an adjustment is made to write the asset down to its fair value 
estimated fair values are determined based on quoted market values  discounted cash flows or internal and external appraisals  as applicable 
assets to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of the cork  ireland facility 
as a result of this change in circumstances  we estimated the fair value of the long lived assets resulting in an impairment charge of million 
based on the estimated fair values of long lived assets  we have recorded impairment charges of million  million and million for years ended june    and  respectively 
if circumstances change  our estimated fair values may be impacted and have a material effect on our reported financial position and results of operations 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning impairment charges 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 and  as a consequence  discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
under the guidelines of sfas no 
 goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
unless circumstances otherwise dictate  we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
we will continue to amortize other intangible assets that meet certain criteria over their useful lives  and these assets will also be subject to an impairment test based on estimated fair value 
we utilize the present value of expected net cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
this present value model requires management to estimate future net cash flows  the timing of these cash flows  and a discount rate or weighted average cost of capital representing the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainly of future cash flows 
the discount rate  adjusted for inflation  is based on independently calculated beta risks for a composite group of companies  our target capital mix  and an estimated market risk premium 
the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows were consistent with the reporting unit s internal planning 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired 
the determination of an impairment loss is complex and requires that we make many assumptions and estimates 
if our estimates of future cash flows or the underlying assumptions and estimates change  we may need to record additional impairment losses in the future 
planned maintenance activities through june   we accounted for major planned maintenance activities at our specialty fiber plant in perry  florida by accruing the cost of the maintenance activities over the period between each planned maintenance activity the accrue in advance method  which ranged from two to five year intervals 
all other facilities expensed maintenance costs as incurred 
we re evaluated this critical accounting policy and  effective july   changed our method of accounting from the accrue in advance method to the direct expense method 
under the new accounting method  maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe the new method is preferable in this circumstance because the maintenance liability is not recorded until there is an obligating event when the maintenance event is actually being performed 
the direct expense method eliminates significant estimates and judgments inherent under the accrual method  and it is the predominant method used in the industry 
we do not consider the direct expense method of accounting for planned maintenance activities to be a critical accounting policy 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  raw material costs and the price of certain commodities used in our production processes 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures 
further  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following risk management discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the sensitivity analyses are forward looking statements of market risk  assuming that certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to actual developments in the global financial markets 
the analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risks discussed below should not be considered projections of future events or losses 
a discussion of our accounting policies for risk management is included in accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rates the fair value of our long term public debt is based on an average of the bid and offer prices at year end 
the fair value of the credit facility approximates its carrying value due to its variable interest rate 
the carrying value of other long term debt approximates fair value based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of long term debt at june  were million and million  respectively  and at june  were million and million  respectively 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates and would amount to million increase in the fair value of long term debt 
we had million of variable rate long term debt outstanding at june  at this borrowing level  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have a million unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows 
the primary interest rate exposures on floating rate debt are with respect to european interbank rates and us prime rates 
foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency 
buckeye and our subsidiaries generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and costs and their translation into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we are exposed include the european euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
we generally view as long term our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  we do not generally hedge these net investments 
however  we use capital structuring techniques to manage our net investment in foreign currencies as considered necessary 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into dollars using the year end exchange rates is million and million at june  and  respectively 
the potential foreign currency translation loss from investment in foreign subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounts to approximately million at june  this change would be reflected in the equity section of our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the primary foreign currency exposures on our long term investments are with the euro  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
cost of raw materials amounts paid by us for wood  cotton fiber and fluff pulp represent the largest component of our variable costs of production 
the availability and cost of these materials are subject to market fluctuations caused by factors beyond our control  including weather conditions 
significant decreases in availability or increases in the cost of wood or cotton fiber  to the extent not reflected in prices for our products  could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
commodities in order to minimize market exposure  we use forward contracts to reduce price fluctuations in a desired percentage of forecasted purchases of natural gas over a period of generally less than one year 
there were no natural gas contracts outstanding at june  or requiring fair value treatment 
exposure to commodity products also creates volatility in pricing 
if our research and development efforts do not result in the commercialization of new  proprietary products  we will continue to have significant exposure to fluff pulp and other commodity products  which could result in volatility in sales prices and profits 
industry cyclicality the demand and pricing of our products  particularly fluff pulp  are influenced by the much larger market for papermaking pulps which is highly cyclical 
the markets for most cellulose based products are sensitive to both changes in general global economic conditions and to changes in industry capacity 
both of these factors are beyond our control 
the price of these products can fluctuate significantly when supply and demand become imbalanced for any reason 
financial performance can be heavily influenced by these pricing fluctuations and the general cyclicality of the industries in which we compete 
it is not certain that current prices will be maintained  that any price increases will be achieved  or that industry capacity utilization will reach favorable levels 
the demand  cost and prices for our products may thus fluctuate substantially in the future and downturns in market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contingencies our operations are subject to extensive general and industry specific federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
we devote significant resources to maintaining compliance with such requirements 
we expect that  due to the nature of our operations  we will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental requirements including standards applicable to wastewater discharges and air emissions and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with such requirements 
given the uncertainties associated with predicting the scope of future requirements  there can be no assurance that we will not in the future incur material environmental compliance costs or liabilities
