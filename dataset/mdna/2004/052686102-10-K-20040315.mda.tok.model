the company no longer sells or markets this product and does not expect phoneprint revenues to be significant in the future 
clients lightbridge historically has provided its products and services to wireless carriers in the united states 
in  lightbridge began to market its products and services to a broader range of telecommunications carriers operating around the world 
in november  lightbridge announced its business strategy to meet the needs of non carrier as well as carrier clients  and announced an agreement with verisign  inc verisign to authenticate the identity of consumers engaged in on line transactions 
revenues attributable to lightbridge s largest clients accounted for approximately  and of lightbridge s total revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following lightbridge clients accounted for more than of total revenues in the years indicated years ended dec 
 sprint spectrum lp at t wireless services  inc ericsson ab nextel finance company total the company s prepay billing system is sold primarily through a distribution agreement with ericsson ab ericsson 
ericsson accounted for substantially all of the revenues derived from the prepay system in 
table of contents the years presented 
the loss of one or more of these major clients  a decrease in orders by one or more of them or a change in the combination of products and services they obtain from the company would adversely affect lightbridge s revenues  margins and net income 
lightbridge has agreements with many of its clients that provide for the purchase of various combinations of products and services including cas  risk management and teleservices over periods of one to three years 
although some of these agreements contain annual minimum payment requirements  such minimum payments are typically substantially less than the amount of revenue lightbridge has historically received from the particular client and therefore provide only limited assurance of future sales 
lightbridge s client agreements also often permit changes in the combination of products and services purchased by the client during the term of the agreement 
such changes can affect the revenues  margins and net income that lightbridge achieves from quarter to quarter in its transaction business 
lightbridge has agreements with at t wireless  inc at t  sprint spectrum lp sprint and nextel operations  inc nextel for the provision of credit decision services 
the agreements with nextel and sprint were renewed in and extended in each case through december the agreement with at t extends through december the agreement with ericsson was amended in and continues in effect until either party gives the other days notice of cancellation 
in february  cingular wireless announced an agreement to acquire at t 
cingular wireless is not presently a client of lightbridge 
the company is unable to predict the effect of the acquisition on its relationship with at t 
however  the loss of at t as a client would have a significant impact on the company s business and operations 
because lightbridge derives almost all of its revenues from telecommunications carriers  the demand for lightbridge s products and services is dependent  in major part  on the overall market demand for the products and services provided by telecommunications carriers 
in particular  lightbridge s transaction business is dependent on the rate of new subscriber growth and the rate at which subscribers switch from one carrier to another  known as the churn rate 
accordingly  if the growth rate of the telecommunications industry continues to slow and the churn rate does not increase  sales of lightbridge s products and services could continue to decline 
sales and marketing lightbridge s sales strategy is to establish  maintain and foster long term relationships with its clients  and to establish third party sales alliances 
lightbridge s sales and client services activities are led by relationship teams 
lightbridge employs a team approach to selling in order to develop a consultative relationship with existing and prospective clients 
in addition to relationship teams  lightbridge s sales approach includes direct sales staff with expertise in particular solutions and sales through channel partners and alliances  particularly internationally 
lightbridge s software products and services typically require significant investment by the carrier with delays frequently associated with capital expenditures  and involve multilevel testing  integration  implementation and support requirements 
product managers  as well as other technical  operational and consulting personnel  are frequently involved in the business development and sales process 
the teams conduct needs assessments and  working with the client  develop a customized solution 
the sales cycle for lightbridge s software products and services is typically nine to twenty four months  although the period may be substantially longer in some cases  and is subject to a number of risks over which the company has little control  including the carrier s budgetary and capital spending constraints  internal decision making processes  and general market and economic conditions 
prepay is sold primarily through a nonexclusive distribution agreement with ericsson 
it is also sold through a direct sales force and reseller agreements with sentori  inc and nortel networks  inc 
service and technical support for lightbridge products are provided through both direct field service and support personnel and distributors 
a high level of continuing service and support is critical to the objective of developing long term relationships with clients 
technical assistance is also provided as part of the standard 
table of contents support and service package that clients typically purchase for the length of their respective agreements 
on site installations and various training courses for distributors and clients are also offered 
engineering  research and development lightbridge believes that its future success will depend in part on its ability to continue to enhance  implement  and maintain its existing product and service offerings including  without limitation cas  and to develop  implement and maintain new products and services that allow clients to respond to changing market requirements 
lightbridge s research and development activities consist of long term efforts to develop  enhance and maintain products and services and short term projects to make modifications to respond to immediate client needs 
in addition to internal research and development efforts  lightbridge intends to continue its strategy of gaining access to new technology through strategic relationships and acquisitions where appropriate 
lightbridge spent approximately million  million and million on engineering  research and development in the years ended december   and  respectively 
competition the market for products and services to wireless and other communications providers is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
the market is fragmented  and a number of companies currently offer one or more products or services competitive with those offered by lightbridge 
in addition  many telecommunications carriers are providing  or can provide internally  products and services competitive with those lightbridge offers 
trends in the telecommunications industry  including greater consolidation and technological or other developments that make it simpler or more cost effective for carriers to provide certain services themselves  could affect demand for lightbridge s products or services 
these developments could make it more difficult for lightbridge to offer a cost effective alternative to a telecommunications carrier s own capabilities 
in addition  lightbridge anticipates continued growth in the online business services industry and  consequently  the entrance of new competitors in the future 
lightbridge believes that the principal competitive factors in the communications provider and online industries include the ability to identify and respond to carrier  non carrier and subscriber needs  timeliness  quality and breadth of product and service offerings  price and technical expertise 
lightbridge believes that its ability to compete also depends in part on a number of factors outside its control  including the ability to hire and retain employees  the development of products and services by others that are competitive with lightbridge s products and services  the price at which others offer comparable products and services  and the extent of its competitors responsiveness to carrier  non carrier and subscriber needs 
government regulation the federal communications commission fcc  under the terms of the communications act of  regulates interstate communications and use of the radio spectrum 
although lightbridge is not required to and does not hold any licenses or other authorizations issued by the fcc  the domestic telecommunications carriers that constitute lightbridge s clients are regulated at both the federal and state levels 
federal and state regulation may decrease the growth of the telecommunications industry  affect the development of the wireless markets  limit the number of potential clients for lightbridge s services  impede lightbridge s ability to offer competitive services to the telecommunications market  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on lightbridge s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
changing laws and regulations have caused  and are likely to continue to cause  significant changes in the industry  including the entrance of new competitors  consolidation of industry participants  the introduction of bundled wireless and wireline services and the introduction of wireless number portability wnp in november those changes could in turn subject lightbridge to increased pricing pressures  decrease the demand for lightbridge s products and services  increase lightbridge s cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on lightbridge s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the telecommunications industry outside the united states is also subject to government regulation  which could have similar effects on lightbridge s ability to increase or maintain its penetration of international markets 

table of contents in addition  privacy legislation including the gramm leach bliley act glba and regulations thereunder affect the nature and extent of the products or services the company is able to provide to clients as well as the company s ability to collect  monitor and disseminate information subject to privacy protection 
consumer legislation such as the fair credit reporting act fcra and equal credit opportunity act ecoa and state laws also affect the nature and extent of the products or services the company is able to provide to clients 
proprietary rights lightbridge s success is dependent upon proprietary technology 
lightbridge has traditionally relied on a combination of copyrights  patents  trade secrets and employee and third party non disclosure agreements to establish and protect its rights in its software products and proprietary technology 
lightbridge protects the source code versions of its products as trade secrets and as unpublished copyrighted works  and has internal policies and systems designed to limit access to and require the confidential treatment of its trade secrets 
lightbridge software is provided either on an outsourced basis or under license agreements that grant clients the right to use  but contains various provisions intended to protect lightbridge s ownership and confidentiality of the underlying copyrights and technology 
lightbridge requires its employees and other parties with access to its confidential information to execute agreements prohibiting unauthorized use or disclosure of lightbridge s technology 
in addition  all of lightbridge s employees are required as a condition of employment to enter into confidentiality agreements with lightbridge 
lightbridge also relies on the law of trademarks to establish and protect rights in its products  services and brand names 
lightbridge currently has several issued us and foreign patents and applications pending in the us patent and trademark office and with certain foreign regulatory bodies 
there can be no assurance that any pending patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents  or that lightbridge s current patents or any future patents will provide meaningful protection to lightbridge 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by lightbridge to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
it may be possible for unauthorized parties to copy certain portions of lightbridge s products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that lightbridge regards as proprietary 
existing copyright and trade secret laws and patents issued to lightbridge offer only limited protection 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect lightbridge s proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
lightbridge s competitive position may be affected by limitations on its ability to protect its proprietary information 
however  lightbridge believes that patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and other legal protections are less significant to lightbridge s success than other factors  such as the knowledge  ability and experience of lightbridge s personnel  new product and service development  frequent product enhancements  customer service and ongoing product support 
certain technologies used in lightbridge s products and services are licensed from third parties 
lightbridge generally pays license fees on these technologies and believes that if the license for any such third party technology were terminated  it would be able to develop such technology internally or license equivalent technology from another vendor  although no assurance can be given that such development or licensing could be effected without significant delay or expense 
although lightbridge believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert such claims against lightbridge in the future or that such future claims will not be successful 
lightbridge could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources with respect to the defense of any claims relating to proprietary rights  which could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  parties making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief  which could effectively block lightbridge s ability to make  use  sell  distribute or market its products and services in the united states or abroad 
such a judgment could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge 
in the event a claim relating to proprietary technology or 
table of contents information is asserted against lightbridge  lightbridge may seek licenses to such intellectual property 
there can be no assurance  however  that such a license could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to lightbridge 
the failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could preclude the sale  manufacture or distribution of lightbridge s products and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on lightbridge 
employees as of january   lightbridge had a total of employees  of which were full time and were part time or seasonal 
the number of personnel employed by lightbridge varies seasonally 
none of lightbridge s employees are represented by a labor union  and lightbridge believes that its employee relations are good 
the future success of lightbridge will depend in large part upon its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel can be strong  particularly for sales and marketing personnel  software developers and service consultants

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates lightbridge s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon lightbridge s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of this annual report on form k requires lightbridge to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
lightbridge bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily derived from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not differ from those estimates 
lightbridge has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
revenue recognition 
lightbridge s revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting its operations 
in addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and bonuses 
certain judgments relating to the elements required for revenue recognition affect the application of its revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue  change in judgments concerning recognition of revenue  change in mix  amount of international sales or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
lightbridge must also make estimates of the collectability of its accounts receivable 
an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
lightbridge analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer creditworthiness  current domestic and international economic trends and changes in its customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if lightbridge s estimates of uncollectibility prove to be inaccurate  additional allowances would be required 
income taxes and deferred taxes 
lightbridge s income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
lightbridge assesses the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provides any necessary valuation allowances as required 
if lightbridge were to determine that it was more likely than not unable to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to operations in the period that such determination was made

authorize 
net is a provider of payment solutions for online customer transactions 
the authorize 
net payment gateway provides credit card and electronic check solutions to companies that process orders for goods and services over the internet 
authorize 
net connects small and medium sized businesses to large credit card processors and banking organizations  allowing those businesses to accept electronic payments 
inflation although certain of the company s expenses increase with general inflation in the economy  inflation has not had a material impact on the company s financial results to date 
risk factors if one or more of our major clients stops using our products or services or changes the combination of products and services it uses  our operating results would suffer significantly 
our revenues are concentrated among a few major clients 
our largest clients accounted for approximately of our total revenues in  and we expect that most of our revenues will continue to come from a relatively small number of clients for the foreseeable future 
consequently  our revenues  margins and net income may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on the actions of a single significant client 
a client may take actions that significantly affect us for reasons that we cannot necessarily anticipate or control  such as reasons related to the client s financial condition  changes in the client s business strategy or operations  the introduction of alternative competing products or services  or as the result of the perceived quality or cost effectiveness of our products or services 
our services agreements with sprint  and nextel expire on december   and our service agreement with at t expires on december  it is possible that sprint  nextel and or at t could elect not to renew their agreements  to reduce the volume of products and services they purchase from us or to request significant changes to the pricing or other terms in any renewal agreement 
in february  cingular wireless announced an agreement to acquire at t 
cingular wireless is not presently a client of lightbridge 
the company is unable to predict the effect of the acquisition on its relationship with at t 
however  the loss of at t as a client would have a significant impact on the company s business and operations 
in addition  the prepay billing system is sold primarily through a distribution agreement with ericsson and represents substantially all of our revenue derived from the prepay billing system in the years indicated 
that agreement may be terminated by either party on days 
table of contents notice to the other 
the loss of any one or more of our major clients would cause sales to fall below expectations and materially reduce our revenues  margins and net income 
our revenues are uncertain because our clients may reduce the amounts of or change the combination of our products or services they purchase 
most of our client contracts extend for terms of between one and three years 
during the terms of these contracts  our clients typically may elect to purchase any of several different combinations of products and services 
the revenue that we receive for processing a transaction for a client may vary significantly depending on the particular products and services used to process the transaction 
in particular  transactions handled through our teleservices group generally result in significantly higher revenue to us than transactions that are submitted and processed electronically 
therefore  our revenues from a particular client may decline if the client changes the combination of products and services it purchases from us 
to the extent our client contracts contain minimum purchase or payment requirements  these minimums are typically at levels significantly below actual or historical purchase or payment levels 
therefore  our current clients may not continue to utilize our products or services at levels similar to previous years or at all  and may not generate significant revenues in future periods 
if any of our major clients significantly reduces or changes the combination of products or services it purchases from us for any reason  our business would be seriously damaged 
our revenues are concentrated in the wireless telecommunications industry  which is experiencing declining growth rates  consolidation and increasing pressure to control costs 
we currently derive almost all of our revenues from companies in the wireless telecommunications industry  and we expect that  even after our acquisition of authorize 
net  wireless telecommunications companies will continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
in recent years  the growth rate of the domestic wireless industry has slowed 
in addition  consolidation has affected the number of carriers to whom our products and services can be marketed and sold  and competition among wireless carriers has continued to increase  resulting in heightened efforts by carriers to control costs 
many of our carrier clients have sought  and may in the future seek  pricing concessions when they renew their service agreements with us  which could affect our revenues and profitability 
in addition  certain of our carrier clients have sought bankruptcy protection in the past year  and we believe it is likely that additional clients may file for bankruptcy protection if current industry conditions continue 
bankruptcy filings by our clients or former clients such as worldcom may prevent us from collecting some or all of the amounts owing to us at the time of filing  may require us to return some or all of any payments received by us within days prior to a bankruptcy filing which could be significant in amount as is the case with worldcom and may also result in the termination of our service agreements 
as a result of the foregoing conditions  our success depends on a number of factors our ability to maintain our profit margins on sales of products and services to companies in the wireless telecommunications industry  the financial condition of our clients and their continuing ability to pay us for services and products  our ability to develop and market new or enhanced products and services to new and existing clients  continued growth of the domestic wireless telecommunications markets  the number of carriers seeking to implement prepaid billing services  and our ability to increase sales of our products and services internationally 
we have made and may continue to make acquisitions  which involve risks 
we acquired coral systems  inc in november of  corsair in february of and the assets of altawave in february of we expect to close our acquisition of authorize 
net in the second quarter of we may also make additional acquisitions in the future if we identify companies  technologies or assets 
table of contents that appear to complement our business 
acquisitions involve risks that could cause the actual results of any acquisitions we make to differ from our expectations 
for example we may be unable to integrate authorize 
net or other acquired businesses successfully and to realize anticipated economic  operational and other benefits in a timely manner 
integration of authorize 
net could prove especially difficult because it operates in a market in which we have limited expertise and because its operations are geographically remote from our existing facilities 
the need to retain existing clients and employees of an acquired company and to integrate differing corporate cultures can also present significant risks 
if we are unable to successfully integrate authorize 
net or other acquired businesses  we may incur substantial costs and delays or other operational  technical or financial problems 
our acquisition of authorize 
net will significantly reduce our available cash and liquidity 
in other future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could be dilutive to our shareholders or we may use our remaining cash  which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
we also may incur additional debt and amortization expense related to intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
this additional debt and amortization expense  as well as the potential impairment of any purchased goodwill  may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
we may also be required to make continuing investments in acquired products or technologies to bring them to market  which may negatively affect our cash flows and net income 
in addition  we may assume contingent liabilities that may be difficult to estimate 
we may not be able to close our pending acquisition of authorize 
net corporation because of the failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals or meet certain closing conditions 
if we do not close  we will have incurred significant transaction related costs  diverted management s attention from our existing business  and delayed our strategy to expand into new markets 
acquisitions may divert management s attention from our existing business and may damage our relationships with our key clients and employees 
the success of our growth strategy is dependent on our ability to expand into new markets 
in order to achieve growth in our business  we are seeking to expand our business into new markets  including the online transaction market and the wireless data market 
if we are not able to expand successfully into new markets  our financial results and future prospects may be harmed 
our ability to enter new markets depends on a number of factors  including growth in the online transaction market  our ability to provide products and services to address the needs of those markets  and competition in those markets 
if we do not continue to enhance our existing products and services  and develop or acquire new ones  we will not be able to compete effectively 
the industries in which we do business or intend to do business have been changing rapidly as a result of increasing competition  technological advances  regulatory changes and evolving industry practices and standards  and we expect these changes will continue 
current and potential clients have also experienced significant changes as the result of consolidation among existing industry participants and economic conditions 
in addition  the business practices and technical requirements of our clients are subject to changes that may require modifications to our products and services 
in order to remain competitive and successfully address the evolving needs of our clients  we must commit a significant portion of our resources to identify and anticipate emerging technological and market trends affecting our core wireless business as well as the online market  
table of contents enhance our current products and services in order to increase their cost effectiveness to clients that are seeking to control costs and to meet regulatory requirements  develop or acquire new products and services that meet emerging client needs  such as services to allow companies to authenticate the identity of consumers engaged in online transactions and products and services for the online market  modify our products and services in response to changing business practices and technical requirements of our clients  as well as to new regulatory requirements  such as local number portability  integrate our current and future products  and create and maintain interfaces to changing client and third party systems 
we must achieve these goals in a timely and cost effective manner and successfully market our new and enhanced products and services to clients 
in the past  we have experienced errors or delays in developing new products and in modifying or enhancing existing products 
if we are unable to expand or appropriately enhance or modify our products and services quickly and efficiently  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
our clients and we must comply with complex and changing consumer credit and privacy laws 
government regulation influences our current and prospective clients activities  as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services 
for example  our clients include telecommunications companies that  to the extent that they extend consumer credit  may be subject to federal and state regulations 
in making credit evaluations of consumers  performing fraud screening or user authentication  our clients are subject to requirements of federal law  including the ecoa  the fcra and the glba and regulations thereunder  as well as state laws which impose a variety of additional requirements 
privacy legislation may also affect the nature and extent of the products or services that we can provide to clients as well as our ability to collect  monitor and disseminate information subject to privacy protection 
although most of our products and services  other than our profile service  are not directly subject to these requirements  we must take these extensive and evolving requirements into account in order to meet our clients needs 
when we complete our acquisition of authorize 
net  we will also need to comply with state and federal laws governing the processing of financial transactions 
in some cases  consumer credit laws require our clients to notify consumers of credit decisions made in connection with their applications for telecommunications services  and we have contracted with some of our clients  including sprint  at t  nextel  western wireless corporation and dobson communications  inc  to provide such notices on their behalf 
our software has in the past contained  and could in the future contain  undetected errors affecting compliance by our clients with one or more of these legal requirements 
failure to properly implement these requirements in our products and services in a timely  cost effective and accurate manner could result in liability  either directly or as indemnitor of our clients  damage to our reputation and relationships with clients and a loss of business 
our business may be harmed by errors in our software 
the software that we develop and license to clients  and that we also use in providing our transaction processing and call center services  is extremely complex and contains hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code 
large  complex software systems such as ours are susceptible to errors 
the difficulty of preventing and detecting errors in our software is compounded by the fact that we maintain multiple versions of our systems to meet the differing requirements of our major clients  and must implement frequent modifications to these systems in response to these clients evolving business policies and technical requirements 
our software design  development and testing processes are not always adequate to detect errors in our software prior to its release or commercial use 
as a result  we have from time to time discovered  and may likely in the future discover  errors in software that we have put into commercial use for our clients  including some of our largest clients 
because of the complexity of our systems and the large volume of transactions they process on a daily basis  we sometimes have not detected software errors until after they have affected a significant number of transactions 
software errors can have the effect of causing clients that utilize 
table of contents our products and services to fail to comply with their intended credit or business policies  or to fail to comply with legal requirements  such as those under the ecoa  fcra  or glba 
such errors  particularly if they affect a major client  can harm our business in several ways  including the following we may suffer a loss of revenue if  due to software errors  we are temporarily unable to provide products or services to our clients  we may not be paid for the products or services provided to a client that contain errors  or we may be liable for losses or damages sustained by a client or its subscribers as a result of such errors  we may incur additional unexpected expenses to correct errors in our software  or to fund product development projects that we may undertake to minimize the occurrences of such errors in the future  we may damage our relationships with clients or suffer a loss of reputation within our industry  we may become subject to litigation or regulatory scrutiny  and our clients may terminate or fail to renew their agreements with us or reduce the products and services they purchase from us 
our errors and omissions insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to software errors 
it is also possible that such insurance might cease to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our initiatives to improve our software design and development processes may not be successful 
the development of our core products has  in some cases  extended over a period of more than ten years 
this incremental development process has resulted in a system which is extremely complex 
systems of the size and complexity of ours are inherently difficult to modify and maintain 
beginning in  we began the process of rebuilding portions of our core products in java  replacing the proprietary three tiered software architecture historically employed in our products with a new architecture using a middleware layer and a standard database across all products 
we expect that this architecture  which relies on component based development and reusable frameworks  will accelerate our product development process and make it easier to maintain our software systems 
we are also evaluating changes in our product development  testing and control processes to improve the accuracy and timeliness of modifications that we make to our software  including the frequent modifications that we must make in response to changes in the business policies and technical requirements of our clients 
we believe that our initiatives to implement a new product architecture and to improve our product development  test and control processes will be important to our future competitive position and success 
if we are not successful in carrying out these initiatives on a timely basis or in a manner that is acceptable to our clients  our business and future prospects could be harmed 
our success is dependent in part on prepay  which may not achieve market penetration 
our future operating results will depend to a significant extent on the demand for and market penetration of prepay  our prepaid metered billing system 
to date  only a small number of wireless carriers  almost all of them outside the us  have deployed prepay  and the rate of adoption of the prepay system will need to increase significantly in order to achieve our revenue targets 
prepay has been sold predominantly by ericsson 
ericsson  from time to time  may evaluate and seek to distribute or acquire alternative vendors prepaid product offerings 
any change in the terms of our distribution arrangements with ericsson or ericsson s desire to discontinue our relationship would drastically affect sales of prepay 
although our own sales force also sells prepay  it has not yet generated significant prepay sales 
we cannot ensure that sales of the prepay system will increase or that prepay will gain market penetration 
if prepay does not gain market penetration our future operating results would be adversely affected 
if we are unable to acquire complementary businesses  our future growth will be limited 
a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses  technologies or products that expand and complement our business 
we believe acquisitions are necessary for us to continue to grow at a desirable rate  
table of contents and we will continue to evaluate possible acquisition opportunities in the future 
even if we are able to identify suitable companies or businesses to buy  we may not be able to purchase any of these companies at favorable prices  or at all  for any number of reasons 
if we are unable to make acquisitions  we may not be able to meet or exceed our historical levels of growth and earnings 
we may not be able to successfully manage operational changes 
over the last several years  our operations have experienced rapid growth in some areas and significant restructurings and cutbacks in others 
these changes have created significant demands on our executive  operational  development and financial personnel and other resources 
if we achieve future growth in our business  or if we are forced to make additional restructurings  we may further strain our management  financial and other resources 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to continue to improve our operational and financial controls and reporting systems 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully manage the future changes in our business 
our future revenues may be uncertain because of reliance on third parties for marketing and distribution 
prepay is currently marketed primarily through a distribution agreement with ericsson 
we have also entered into a business alliance with verisign to assist us in penetrating the online transaction market 
in addition  authorize 
net distributes its service offerings primarily through third party resellers 
we intend to continue to market and distribute our current and future products and services through existing and other relationships both in and outside of the united states 
there are no minimum purchase obligations applicable to any existing distributor or other sales and marketing partners and we do not expect to have any guarantees of continuing orders 
failure by our existing and future distributors or other sales and marketing partners to generate significant revenues or our failure to establish additional distribution or sales and marketing alliances could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  distributors and other sales and marketing partners may become our competitors with respect to the products they distribute either by developing a competitive product themselves or by distributing a competitive offering 
for example  ericsson may evaluate and seek to distribute or acquire alternative vendors prepaid products that compete with prepay  and verisign may elect to market or acquire alternative fraud and identity verification products 
competition from existing and future distributors or other sales and marketing partners could significantly harm sales of our products 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could fall dramatically 
our common stock price could also fall dramatically if investors or public market analysts reduce their estimates of our future quarterly operating results  whether as a result of information we disclose  or based on industry  market or economic trends  or other factors 
our revenues are difficult to forecast for a number of reasons seasonal and retail trends affect our transaction services revenues  which historically have represented the majority of our total revenues  and may affect demand for our other products and services 
as a result  our revenues can fluctuate 
for example  our revenues generally have been highest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year  particularly in the holiday shopping season between thanksgiving and christmas 
in addition  marketing initiatives undertaken by our clients or their competitors may significantly affect the number of transactions we process 
the sales process for our products and services is lengthy  sometimes exceeding twenty four months 
the length of the sales process makes our revenues difficult to predict 
the delay of one or more large 
table of contents orders  particularly orders for software  which typically result in a substantial amount of non recurring revenue  could cause our quarterly revenues to fall substantially below expectations 
we ship our software products within a short period after receipt of an order  and we usually do not have a material backlog of unfilled orders of software products 
consequently  our revenues from software licenses in any quarter depend substantially on the orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
as a result  a delay in the consummation of a license agreement may cause our revenues to fall below expectations for that quarter 
our consulting services revenues can fluctuate based on the timing of product sales and projects we perform for our clients 
many of our consulting engagements are of a limited duration  so it can be difficult for us to forecast consulting services revenues or staffing requirements accurately more than a few months in advance 
most of our expenses  particularly employee compensation  are relatively fixed 
as a result  even relatively small variations in the timing of our revenues may cause significant variations in our quarterly operating results and may result in quarterly losses 
as a result of these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on our quarterly results of operations to predict our future performance 
our foreign sales and operations subject us to risks and concerns which could negatively affect our business overall 
we expect our international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues 
we also intend to further expand our sales efforts internationally 
in addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the us  sales to clients outside the us and operations in foreign countries present us with many additional risks  including the following the imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments  the need to comply with a wide variety of complex us and foreign import and export laws and treaties  political and economic instability that may lead to reduced demand for our products and services  changes in tariffs  taxes and other barriers that may reduce our ability to sell our solutions or may reduce the profitability of those solutions  longer payment cycles and increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  which may reduce our earnings if we denominate arrangements with international clients in the currency of the country in which our products or services are provided  or with respect to arrangements with international clients that are us dollar denominated  which may make our systems less price competitive  changes in technology standards  such as interfaces between products  that are developed by foreign groups and may require additional development efforts on our part or change the buying behavior of some of our clients  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulties in managing a global network of distributors or representatives and in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  costs and risks of localizing systems in foreign countries  additional complications and expenses related to supporting products internationally  and 
table of contents the possibility that our purchase agreements may be governed by foreign laws that differ significantly from us laws  which may limit our ability to enforce our rights under these agreements 
we face significant competition for a limited supply of qualified software engineers and consultants 
our business depends on the services of skilled software engineers who can develop  maintain and enhance our products and consultants who can undertake complex client projects 
in general  only highly qualified  highly educated personnel have the training and skills necessary to perform these tasks successfully 
in order to maintain the competitiveness of our products and to meet client requirements  we need to attract  motivate and retain a significant number of software engineers and consultants 
qualified personnel such as these are in short supply and we face significant competition for these employees  from not only our competitors but also clients and other enterprises 
other employers may offer software engineers and consultants significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive career paths than we are able to offer 
any failure on our part to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel would seriously damage our business 
our future success depends on the continued services of key executive officers 
our future success will depend to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers  particularly pamela da reeve  chief executive officer 
we do not have any employment contracts requiring ms 
reeve or any of our other executive officers to continue their employment for any period of time  and we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers other than ms 
reeve 
if we lose the services of one or more of these persons  we may be unable to successfully manage our current business or implement our planned business objectives and our future operations may be adversely affected 
we face competition from a broad and increasing range of vendors 
the market for products and services offered to communications providers and participants in online transactions is highly competitive and subject to rapid change 
each of these markets is fragmented  and a number of companies currently offer one or more products or services competitive with ours 
we anticipate continued growth and the formation of new alliances in each of the markets in which we compete  which will result in the entrance of new competitors in the future 
we face potential competition from several primary sources software vendors that provide one or more customer acquisition  customer relationship management and retention or risk management solutions  including ectel ltd  tsi telecommunications services inc tsi  fair  isaac co 
inc  magnum software systems  inc  american management systems  incorporated and slp infoware  telecommunications equipment vendors that market software based solutions to complement their hardware offerings  such as hewlett packard company and ericsson  service providers that offer customer acquisition  customer relationship management and retention  risk management or authentication services in connection with other services  including choicepoint inc  visa usa  experian information solutions  inc  equifax  inc  riskwise  llc  trans union  llc  schlumberger sema plc and amdocs ltd  information technology departments within larger carriers that have the ability to provide products and services that are competitive with those we offer  information technology vendors that offer wireless and internet software applications such as oracle corporation  microsoft corporation and international business machine corporation  consulting firms or systems integrators that may offer competitive services or the ability to develop customized solutions for customer acquisition and qualification  customer relationship management and retention or risk management  such as american management systems  incorporated  accenture ltd  bearingpoint  inc  peoplesoft  inc  siebel systems  inc and cap gemini ernst young  
table of contents software vendors of prepaid wireless billing products  including boston communications group  inc  intervoice  inc  comverse technology  inc  glenayre technologies  inc  verisign telecommunications services  telemac cellular corporation  fair  isaac co 
inc  orga kartensysteme gmbh  schlumberger sema plc  alcatel usa  priority call management  lucent technologies  inc  hewlett packard company tandem division  telcordia technologies  inc and sixbell  a number of alternative technologies  including profilers  personal identification numbers and authentication  provided by companies such as verizon communications  inc  authentix network inc 
and fair  isaac co  inc  and vendors that provide products and services in the wireless data market  such as bridgewater systems corporation  oraclemobile  a division of oracle corporation  thpass  inc  tsi  seven networks  inc 
and openwave systems inc because competitors can easily penetrate one or more of our markets  we anticipate additional competition from other established and new companies 
in addition  competition may intensify as competitors establish cooperative relationships among themselves or alliances with others 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other competitive resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements  or may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services 
in addition  in order to meet client requirements  we must often work cooperatively with companies that are  in other circumstances  competitors 
the need for us to work cooperatively with such companies may limit our ability to compete aggressively with those companies in other circumstances 
a failure of  error in or damage to our computer and telecommunications systems would impair our ability to conduct transactions and support services and harm our business operations 
we provide transaction services and support services using complex computer and telecommunications systems 
our business could be significantly harmed if these systems fail or suffer damage from fire  natural disaster  terrorism  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
in addition  the growth of our client base  a significant increase in transaction volume or an expansion of our facilities may strain the capacity of our computers and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or system failure 
many of our agreements with carriers contain level of service commitments  which we might be unable to fulfill in the event of a natural disaster  an actual or threatened terrorist attack or a major system failure 
errors in our computer and telecommunications systems may adversely impact our ability to provide the products and services contracted for by our clients 
our property and business interruption insurance and errors and omissions insurance might not be adequate to compensate us for any losses that may occur in the event of a natural disaster  terrorist attack or system failure or error 
it is also possible that such insurance might cease to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our reliance on suppliers and vendors could adversely affect our ability to provide our services and products to our clients on a timely and cost efficient basis 
we rely to a substantial extent on third parties such as riskwise llc to provide some of our equipment  software  data  systems and services 
in some circumstances  we rely on a single supplier or limited group of suppliers 
our reliance on outside vendors subjects us to risks  including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components and reduced control over quality  pricing and timing of delivery of components 
for example  in order to provide our credit verification service  we need access to third party credit information databases provided to us by outside vendors 
similarly  delivery of our activation services often requires the availability and performance of billing systems which are also supplied by outside vendors 
if for any reason we were unable to access these databases or billing systems  our ability to process credit verification transactions could be impaired 

table of contents in addition  our business is materially dependent on services provided by various telecommunications providers 
a significant increase in the cost of telecommunications services that we cannot recover through an increase in the price of our services  or any significant interruption in telecommunications services  could seriously harm our business 
from time to time  we must also rely upon third parties to develop and introduce components and products to enable us  in turn  to develop new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
in particular  we must rely on the development efforts of third party wireless infrastructure providers in order to allow our prepay product to integrate with both existing and future generations of the infrastructure equipment 
we may not be able to obtain access  in a timely manner  to third party products and development services necessary to enable us to develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
we may not be able to obtain third party products and development services on commercially reasonable terms and we may not be able to replace third party products in the event such products become unavailable  obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents for  or otherwise protect  our proprietary technologies 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  license and confidentiality agreements  and software security measures to protect our proprietary rights 
much of our know how and other proprietary technology is not covered by patent or similar protection  and in many cases cannot be so protected 
if we cannot obtain patent or other protection for our proprietary software and other proprietary intellectual property rights  other companies could more easily enter our markets and compete successfully against us 
we have a limited number of patents in the us and abroad  and have pending applications for additional patents  but we cannot be certain that any additional patents will be issued on those applications  that any of our current or future patents will protect our business or technology against competitors that develop similar technology or products or provide us with a competitive advantage  or that others will not claim rights in our patents or our proprietary technologies 
patents issued and patent applications filed relating to products used in the wireless telecommunications industry are numerous and it may be the case that current and potential competitors and other third parties have filed or will file applications for  or have received or will receive  patents or obtain additional proprietary rights relating to products used or proposed to be used by us 
we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may materially affect our ability to make  use or sell any current or future products 
the laws of some countries in which our products are licensed do not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and clients and restrict access to  and distribution of  our proprietary information 
nevertheless  we may be unable to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or detect unauthorized use of and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our competitors also may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
we may become a party to intellectual property infringement claims  which could harm our business 
from time to time  we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to protect our rights or defend a client s rights 
these claims  regardless of merit  may consume valuable management time  result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays  all of which could seriously harm our business and operating results 
furthermore  parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to make  use  sell or otherwise practice our intellectual property  whether or not patented or described in pending patent applications  or to further develop or commercialize our products in the us and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties claiming infringement by us of their intellectual property in order to settle these claims 
these royalty 
table of contents or licensing agreements  if available  may not have terms that are acceptable to us 
in addition  if we are forced to enter into a license agreement with terms that are unfavorable to us  our operating results would be materially harmed 
our business could require additional financing 
our future business activities  including our planned acquisition of authorize 
net  the development or acquisition of new or enhanced products and services  the acquisition of additional computer and network equipment  the relocation of our corporate headquarters  and the international expansion of our business will require us to make significant capital expenditures 
if our available cash resources prove to be insufficient  because of unanticipated expenses  revenue shortfalls or otherwise  we may need to seek additional financing or curtail our expansion activities 
if we obtain equity financing for any reason  our existing stockholders may experience dilution in their investments 
if we obtain debt financing  our business could become subject to restrictions that affect our operations or increase the level of risk in our business 
it is also possible that  if we need additional financing  we will not be able to obtain it on acceptable terms  or at all 
our anti takeover provisions may discourage potential acquisitions or changes of control 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could be used by our incumbent management to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if the change in control might be beneficial to our stockholders 
this could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in particular  we may issue preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval  upon terms determined by our board of directors 
the rights of holders of our common stock would be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of holders of any preferred stock issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding stock 
we also have adopted a stockholder rights plan that may deter or delay attempts to acquire us or to accumulate shares of common stock 
except for the stockholder rights plan  we have no present plans to designate or issue any shares of preferred stock 
in addition  the members of our board of directors serve staggered three year terms  with approximately one third of the members elected each year 
this structure makes it more difficult for stockholders to change the composition of a majority of our board
