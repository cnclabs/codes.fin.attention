item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital and liquidity compunet activities below 
insurance services we provided insurance agency services through gold insurance agency  a wholly owned non bank subsidiary 
during  we sold most of our agency locations and substantially reduced the activities of gold insurance agency to offering life insurance and annuity products to the banks clients 
this entity was mostly inactive in and title insurance services in september  we entered into a joint venture agreement with stewart title agency to form gbs holding company  llc 
through its subsidiary  gold title agency  llc  gbs holding operates a title insurance agency business and generates fee income for the owners of the joint venture 
during  the decision was made to sell gold title agency 
this transaction is expected to close the second quarter of investment portfolio our banks investment portfolios are used to meet our banks liquidity needs while endeavoring to maximize investment income 
additionally  management augments the quality of the loan portfolio by maintaining a high quality investment portfolio 
the portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  us government agency instruments and a modest amount of obligations of state and political subdivisions 
in managing our interest rate exposure  we also invest in mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
investment securities were million  or of total assets  on december  federal funds sold and certificates of deposit are not classified as investment securities 
deposits and borrowings deposits are the major source of our banks funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  including local public fund deposits and demand deposits of commercial customers  our banks derive funds from loan principal repayments  maturing investments  federal funds borrowings from commercial banks  borrowings from the frb kc and the federal home loan bank  and from repurchase agreements 
loan repayments and maturing investments are a relatively stable source of funds while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of funds from other sources 
they also may be used on a long term basis for funding specific loan transactions and for general business purposes 
our banks offer a variety of accounts for depositors designed to attract both short term and long term deposits 
these accounts include certificates of deposit  savings accounts  money market accounts  checking and individual retirement accounts 
deposit accounts generally earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management s desire to increase or decrease certain types or maturities of deposits 
competition the deregulation of the banking industry  the widespread enactment of state laws permitting multi bank holding companies  and the availability of nationwide interstate banking has created a highly competitive environment for financial service providers 
this is particularly true for institutions in suburban areas such as gold bank kansas shawnee  leawood  olathe and overland park  kansas locations  and its kansas city and independence  missouri locations  gold bank oklahoma s tulsa and oklahoma city locations and gold bank florida s tampa bay bradenton sarasota locations 
these locations compete for deposits and loans with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking companies and other financial intermediaries 
some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer certain services that we do not currently provide at these locations 
in addition  some of the non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern our banks 
our management believes that our banks generally have been able to compete successfully in their respective communities because of our emphasis on local control and the autonomy of bank management  allowing our banks to meet what is perceived to be the preference of community residents and businesses to deal with local banks 
while management believes our banks will continue to compete successfully in their communities  increased competition could adversely affect our banks earnings 
employees we maintain a corporate staff of approximately persons 
at december   our banks and non bank subsidiaries had approximately full time equivalent employees including corporate staff 
none of our employees nor any of the employees of our banks or non bank subsidiaries are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we  along with our banks and our non bank subsidiaries  believe that our employee relations are satisfactory

sec settlement on march  the company voluntarily submitted to the sec a settlement offer to consent to the entry of an order providing that the company will cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and future violations of sections a and b of the securities exchange act of exchange act and rules b  a and a thereunder 
this settlement offer arose out of the misconduct by michael w 
gullion  the company s former chief executive officer  which was described in the company s form k a filed on april  as a result of the misappropriations of corporate funds by mr 
gullion  there was an overstatement of the company s pre tax income and earnings per share in its forms k for and and its form q for the second and third quarters of at the time of mr 
gullion s misappropriations  the company s internal controls were not adequate to prevent the activities which enabled the misappropriations to occur  including by not having written policies requiring i documentation  such as appraisals  purchase contracts and closing statements  authenticating the purchase price and disposition of proceeds with respect to significant real estate transactions  ii segregation of responsibilities for ordering  auditing and reconciling transactions and monthly reconciliations of various accounts  and iii limitations on mr 
gullion s spending authority 
the company expects the sec to accept its settlement offer because of the prompt remedial actions undertaken by the company and the full cooperation afforded the sec s enforcement staff  which are described below 
no fines have been  or are expected to be  assessed against the company and no violations have been  or are expected to be  alleged against any of the company s existing officers  directors or employees 
immediately after discovery of mr 
gullion s misconduct  an internal inquiry was conducted and mr 
gullion was terminated from his positions with the company and its subsidiaries 
on the following day  before the opening of trading  the company requested the nasdaq to halt trading in its stock and issued a press release and filed a current report on form k announcing mr 
gullion s misconduct  his resulting termination and his replacement by a new chief executive officer 
on the same day the press release was issued  the company s counsel contacted the sec s enforcement staff to provide a more detailed briefing and to pledge the company s full cooperation with the sec s investigation 
the company also worked closely with its outside auditor to restate its and financial statements to reflect mr 
gullion s misappropriations 
the company also engaged in extensive efforts to obtain restitution of the loss it suffered from mr 
guillon s misappropriation 
as a result of its vigorous negotiating efforts  the company entered into two separate restitution agreements with mr 
gullion under which the company received a total of million in restitution payments in this restitution offset the adverse effect on the company s income in and the company gave complete cooperation to the sec s enforcement staff as well as bank regulatory and other law enforcement officials 
among other things  the company voluntarily produced the details of its internal investigation and did not invoke the attorney client privilege  work product protection or other privileges or protections with respect to any of the facts uncovered in the investigation 
approximately million was expended by the company to conduct its internal investigation and implement enhanced internal control and other remedial and preventative measures 
these strengthened internal controls and procedures address the weaknesses which contributed to the inability to prevent mr 
gullion s misconduct and not detect that misconduct earlier 
in particular  the company now has enhanced written policies and procedures i governing significant asset acquisitions  including real estate acquisitions  which require appropriate documentary support and at least dual employee review to provide assurance that the controls have been followed  ii disbursement limits for all officers  including a limit of  for the chief executive officer and required board approval for disbursements above that amount  iii segregation of responsibilities for ordering  auditing and reconciling transactions  iv monthly reconciliation of various accounts  including prepared expenses  other assets and accrued expenses  and v monthly reviews of the bank accounts of executive officers and directors 
the company also took a number of steps on its own initiative to reinforce a corporate culture of honest  ethical and legal behavior and thus a sound internal control environment 
item of the company s form k a filed on april  summarized the extensive actions taken by the company to demonstrate its commitment to those goals 
in addition  gold banc strengthened the independence and effectiveness of its board of directors by adding two new outside board members  one of whom was selected to serve as the non executive chairman of the board and the other of whom qualified as an audit committee financial expert as defined in item h of regulation s k and was selected to serve as the chairman of the audit committee

the lawsuit relates to a resale by the company of  shares of the company s common stock to five directors in the second quarter of  which shares were obtained from michael gullion in partial satisfaction of his restitution obligations to the company 
for a more detailed discussion of the matters surrounding the misconduct of mr 
gullion and the restitution the company received from him  see the company s annual report on form k a for the year ended december  and its form q for the quarterly period ended september  the complaint alleges that the company s directors breached their fiduciary duties by approving the agreement and plan of merger with silver acquisition corp 
and sac acquisition corp  to enable those directors to sell those shares sooner than they would have otherwise been legally able to do under the federal securities laws 
the company believes the claims made by the plaintiffs are without merit and intends to vigorously defend this lawsuit

johnson county is a suburban community near kansas city  missouri 
johnson county has a competitive banking environment 
its robust economic growth has enabled gold bank to rapidly grow its loans and deposits in the county 
gold bank has eleven offices in the growing areas of johnson county and five offices in the remainder of the kansas city metropolitan area 
this presence in the kansas city area accounted for approximately of our total assets at year end we entered the tulsa  oklahoma market in with the acquisition of citizens bank of tulsa  which has subsequently been merged into gold bank oklahoma 
the tulsa location serves a growing area in southeastern tulsa  a light industrial district that is home to more than  small businesses  and is a mature residential area of tulsa 
a third office was opened in a developing residential area of south tulsa during the second quarter of we entered the oklahoma city market and the communities in central and western oklahoma with the acquisition of country banc in march country banc s two subsidiary banks  people first and american heritage  were merged along with citizens bank of tulsa to create gold bank oklahoma

the demographics and per capita income levels are believed to be very promising for the development of our wealth and asset management services 
in  we opened a new branch in tampa bay and a new branch in downtown sarasota 
in  we changed the bank s name to gold bank florida 
gold bank florida accounted for approximately of our total assets at year end other local markets where we operate generally did not experience the level of growth seen in the johnson county  tulsa  oklahoma city and tampa bay sarasota bradenton markets  but their economies were sound with a mix of services  manufacturing and agriculture related industries 
each of the local markets is generally a county seat and our banks locations serve both that city and the surrounding area 
financial services  including traditional and on line banking  brokerage  trust  mortgage and investments  are offered to customers of our banks  either directly through representatives located in bank offices or through telecommunication links with the non bank offices 
influences on earnings our net earnings depends upon the combined results of operations of our banks  each of which conducts a commercial and consumer banking business by attracting deposits from the general public and deploying those funds to earning assets  and our non bank subsidiaries each of which generate income from management fees and commissions 
each bank s profitability depends primarily on net interest income which is interest income on interest earning assets less interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets include loans  investment securities and other earning assets such as federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include customer deposits  time and savings deposits and other borrowings such as federal funds purchased  short term borrowings and long term debt  including junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
besides the balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  net interest income is affected by each bank s interest rate spread 
this spread is the difference between the bank s average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread is affected by changes in interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand  among other factors 
the levels of non interest income and non interest expense also affect our profitability 
a significant portion of our revenue is non interest income of our banks and non bank subsidiaries consisting of investment trading fees and commissions  service fees  gains on the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities  and other fees 
non interest expense consists of compensation and benefits  occupancy related expenses  deposit insurance premiums  expenses of opening bank offices  acquisition related expenses and other operating expenses 
our profitability also is affected by our effective tax rate  our banks provision for loan losses  and various non recurring items 
our approach to management of the spread between interest income and interest expense is described below under results of operations asset liability management 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
many of the company s accounting policies require significant judgment regarding valuation of assets and liabilities 
a summary of significant accounting policies is listed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for loan losses 
the company s most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses and involves significant management valuation judgments 
the company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects the company s estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing this reserve is set forth below under results of operations provision for loan losses and financial condition allowance for loan losses 
the company makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio and provides an allowance for losses based on a number of factors 
if the company s assumptions are wrong  its allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover loan losses 
the company may have to increase the allowance in the future 
material additions to the company s allowance for loan losses would have a material adverse effect on its net earnings 
the company actively manages its past due and non performing loans in each bank in an effort to minimize credit losses and monitor asset quality to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance 
although management believes its allowance for loan losses is adequate for each bank and collectively  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used  or adverse developments arise with respect to non performing or performing loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover loan losses or that significant increases to the allowance will not be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of the company s net income and capital and could result in an inability to pay dividends  among other adverse consequences 
impairment of goodwill analysis 
as required by the provisions of sfas  the company is required to review the goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently based upon facts and circumstances related to a particular reporting unit 
based upon its most recent analysis on december   the company s goodwill related to its banking subsidiaries is not impaired 
the fair value of the company s non bank financial subsidiaries gold capital management and compunet engineering fluctuates significantly based upon  among other factors  the net operating income of these subsidiaries 
if these subsidiaries experience a sustained deterioration in their cash flow from operations  then the company may have to record goodwill impairment charges 
during and  compunet engineering did not earn a majority of its revenue from providing services to financial institutions 
as a result  the company was required under the bhc act to divest itself of compunet 
during the fourth quarter of  the company announced its intent to dispose of compunet 
as a result of the expected disposition of this business  the company recorded additional impairment charges of  and million in the third and fourth quarters of to reduce the carrying value of the net assets including the remaining goodwill to their fair value 
the company sold compunet on february  deferred income taxes 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns related to deferred income 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations

we follow regulatory guidelines in placing loans on a non accrual basis and place loans with doubtful principal repayment on a non accrual basis  whether current or past due 
we consider non performing assets to include all non accrual loans  other loans days or more past due as to principal and interest  other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets 
we do not return a loan to accrual status until it is brought current with respect to both principal and interest and future principal payments are no longer in doubt 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any previously accrued and uncollected interest income is reversed against current income 
we would have recorded additional interest in the amounts of   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  if non accrual loans had been current during these periods 
restructured and impaired loans  other than non accrual loans  are considered insignificant for all years presented 
non performing assets are summarized in the following table december  dollars in thousands loans loans past due days or more still accruing non accrual loans non performing loans other assets foreclosed assets held for sale non performing assets non performing loans as a percentage of total loans non performing assets as a percentage of total assets non performing assets as a percentage of total loans and oreo the increase during in non performing loans can be largely attributed to three specific credits  which can be summarized as follows million commercial retail development loan that  due to issues that jeopardized their corporate standing  remained past due over days at year end 
subsequently those issues were addressed and we anticipate that this loan will return to performing status by the end of the first quarter of two related credits totaling million placed on non accrual status 
the loans are secured by two convenience stores and a commercial office building 
subsequent to december   two of the properties were sold and the proceeds were used to reduce the total outstanding balance by million 
the bank maintains an allowance of thousand for the remaining balance of these credits 
million residential development and construction loan 
this note matured and the borrower lacked sufficient cash reserves or backlog to support renewal 
the bank maintains a thousand allocated allowance in light of the value of the collateral supporting this loan 
the substantial decrease during in non performing loans resulted primarily through the collection or workout of five specific credits that were non performing as of december  the action taken with respect to these non performing loans can be summarized as follows collection in full of a million loan secured by a manufacturing facility in oklahoma 
as of december   the bank maintained a specific allowance of thousand for this secured loan 
reduction of million through the collection and charge off of a loan with a company involved in the manufacturing and sales of cooling towers in oklahoma 
as of december   the bank maintained an allowance of thousand 
during  the bank took a charge to the allowance of thousand 
collection of an thousand loan secured by a nursing home facility 
as of december   the bank maintained an allowance of thousand for this loan 
upon final settlement  the bank took a charge to the allowance of thousand 
collection of a million loan to a manufacturing company that was enhanced with guarantees from the state of kansas and the small business administration 
as of december   the bank maintained an allowance of thousand for this credit  and upon final settlement in charged off thousand against the allowance for loan losses 
collection in full of a million commercial real estate construction loan that had experienced numerous construction delays 
as of december   the bank maintained an allowance of thousand for this credit 
the drop in non performing assets in also can be attributed to the liquidation of two commercial properties during that were acquired through a settlement agreement in from a company involved in the distribution of sports apparel located in oklahoma and million of proceeds related to the condemnation of land purchased as part of a real estate transaction involving a business acquaintance of mr 
gullion for million 
see item certain relationships and related transactions in the annual report 
allowance for loan losses 
the success of a bank depends to a significant extent upon the quality of its assets  particularly loans 
this is highlighted by the fact that net loans were of our total assets as of december  credit losses are inherent in the lending business 
the risk of loss will vary with general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and the quality of the collateral in the case of a collateralized loan  among other things 
management maintains an allowance for loan losses based on industry standards  management s experience  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for probable loan losses 
each of the banks  on a monthly basis  reviews its loan portfolio  and specifically analyzes loans which are internally classified as having above average risk 
each bank determines the level of reserves to be established for each type of loan based on historical losses  as adjusted for current economic conditions 
for specific high risk loans  the bank analyzes the collateral securing such loan to determine if adequate collateral value is available to cover the indebtedness in the event of default and liquidation of such collateral 
if the bank determines that the principal amount of the high risk loan minus the estimated liquidation value of the collateral is less than the specific loan loss reserve assigned to such loan  then the bank records an additional specific loan loss reserve for such loan 
in general  increasing or decreasing risks in a certain industry type  or changes in the collateral value of specifically identified high risk loans  will impact negatively or positively on the reserve for loan losses 
we actively manage our past due and non performing loans in each bank in an effort to minimize credit losses and monitor asset quality to maintain an adequate loan loss allowance 
although management believes its allowance for loan losses is adequate for each bank and collectively  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses 
further  although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used  or adverse developments arise with respect to non performing or performing loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover loan losses or that significant increases to the allowance will not be required in the future if economic conditions should worsen 
material additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of our net income and capital and could result in the inability to pay dividends  among other adverse consequences 
the allowance for loan losses on december   totaled million  or of outstanding loans  compared to million  or of outstanding loans  at december  the increase in our allowance for loan losses during reflects the million or increase in our loan portfolio 
our non performing loans as a percentage of our total loans increased from at december  to at december  see discussion in the provision for loan losses section for additional detail on the provision for loan loss and charge offs 
charge offs were million  recoveries were million and provisions charged to expense were million in the allowance for loan losses on december  totaled million  a million increase from the prior year 
as part of the internal investigation and the examination by bank regulatory authorities  a careful review was made of loans made by gold bank kansas  gold bank oklahoma or gold bank florida in which mr 
gullion had a role in initiating or approving the loans 
based on an analysis of the creditworthiness of the borrowers on those loans and the value of any collateral securing those loans  bank regulatory authorities indicated that gold bank kansas should increase its allowance for loan losses by million as of december  charge offs were million  recoveries were million and provisions charged to expenses were million in the allowance for loan losses on december   totaled million  a thousand decrease from the prior year 
charge offs were million  recoveries were million and provisions charged to expenses were million in the following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated

the amount of real estate construction loans increased as a result of significant activity in the major metropolitan areas the banks serve 
agricultural loans decreased due to the sale of our rural branches 
in addition  the company  upon the suggestion of the bank regulatory authorities  increased its allowance of loan losses allocated to commercial loans in to reflect those loans in which mr 
gullion had a role in initiating or approving and either the creditworthiness of the borrower or the collateral securing such loan necessitated such additional provision 
the portion of the allowance allocated to real estate and real estate construction loans increased by approximately million and million  respectively  primarily as a result of the increased loans in those categories 
investment activities 
our investment portfolio serves three important functions first  it facilitates the adjustment of the balance sheet s sensitivity to changes in interest rate movements  second  it provides an outlet for investing excess funds  and third  it provides liquidity 
the investment portfolio is structured to maximize the return on invested funds within conservative risk management guidelines 
the portfolio is comprised primarily of available for sale securities  which includes us treasury securities  us government agency obligations  state municipal obligations  federal reserve bank stock  fannie mae stock  and federal home loan bank stock 
the us government agency obligations include federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc notes  fannie mae notes and mortgage backed securities  federal home loan bank notes and government national mortgage association gnma mortgage backed securities

leveraging our capital 
because us government agency securities have a risk based capital weight of only compared to a risk based capital weight for commercial loans  we have leveraged our capital through investments in such securities 
we have increased our investments in us government agency issued mortgaged backed securities financed by repurchase agreements and advances from the federal home loan bank 
we have matched the expected to year duration of these mortgage backed securities with repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank advances with similar maturities to achieve a favorable interest rate spread 
because these mortgage backed securities may prepay faster or slower than we anticipate  we may not achieve our expected interest rate spread on these securities 
deposit activities 
deposits are the major source of our banks funds for lending and other investment purposes 
in addition to deposits  our banks derive funds from interest payments  loan principal payments  loan and securities sales  and funds from operations 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds while deposit inflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions 
our banks may use borrowings on a short term basis  if necessary  to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds  or borrowings may be used on a longer term basis for general business purposes 
deposits are attracted principally from within our banks primary market area through the offering of a broad variety of deposit instruments including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit including jumbo certificates in denominations of thousand or more  and retirement savings plans 
our banks have aggressively attempted to obtain deposits in selected markets to increase market share or meet particular liquidity needs 
we have used brokered deposits and have sought to attract deposits outside our market areas 
on december   we had approximately million of deposits  compared with million on december   which were obtained through brokers 
brokered deposits represented of our total deposits as of december  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by our banks on a periodic basis 
the determination of rates and terms is predicated on funds transaction and liquidity requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and federal obligations

the following table sets forth a summary of our deposits at the dates indicated 
december  dollars in thousands non interest bearing interest bearing savings and now accounts time deposits less than  brokered retail time deposits greater than  brokered retail total deposits the increase in interest bearing brokered deposits in and was a result of the need of additional deposits to fund the increase in loans in our higher growth metropolitan markets 
the following table summarizes at december   our certificates of deposit of  or more by time remaining until maturity dollars in thousands 
maturity period less than three months over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total we have no other time deposits in excess of  derivative financial instruments in august  we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million 
the interest rate swaps are derivative financial instruments and were designated as fair value hedges of the trust preferred securities 
each swap had a notional amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the related trust preferred securities  together with the same payment dates  maturity date and call provisions as the related trust preferred securities 
under each of the swaps  we paid interest at a variable rate equal to a spread over day libor  adjusted quarterly  and we received a fixed rate equal to the interest that we are obligated to pay on the related trust preferred securities 
a million notional amount swap agreement was called by the counter party and terminated on april  a million notional amount swap agreement was called by the counter party and terminated on june  under these swap agreements  no payments were due between the parties and no gain or loss was recognized by us when they were called 
there are no current plans to replace these terminated swap agreements 
the remaining swap agreement with a national amount of million is also callable by the counter party prior to its respective maturity date 
in august  we entered into seven interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million for the purpose of effectively converting million of fixed rate fhlb borrowings into floating rate obligations 
the interest rate swaps are derivative financial instruments and have been designated as fair value hedges of the fhlb borrowings 
each swap has a notional amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of the related fhlb borrowings  together with the same payment dates  maturity date and call provisions as the related fhlb borrowings 
under each of the swaps  we pay interest at a variable rate equal to a spread over day libor  adjusted monthly  and we receive a fixed rate equal to the interest that we are obligated to pay on the related fhlb borrowings 
the use of derivative financial instruments is intended to reduce the company s interest rate exposure 
derivative financial instruments held by the company for purposes of managing interest rate risk are summarized as follows december notional amount credit exposure notional amount credit exposure dollars in thousands interest rate swaps the notional amounts of derivative financial instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and  therefore  are not a measure of the company s credit exposure through its use of these instruments 
the credit exposure represents the accounting loss the company would incur in the event the counterparties failed completely to perform according to the terms of the derivative financial instruments and the collateral held to support the credit exposure was of no value 
during the year ended december   we received net cash flows of million under the three agreements  which was recorded as a reduction of interest expense on borrowings 
capital and liquidity sources of liquidity 
liquidity defines our ability  and the ability of our banks  to generate funds to support asset growth  satisfy other disbursement needs  meet deposit withdrawals and other fund reductions  maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
the immediate liquidity needs of our banks are met primarily by federal funds sold  short term investments  deposits and the generally predictable cash flow primarily repayments  from each bank s assets 
intermediate term liquidity is provided by our banks investment portfolios 
our banks also have established a credit facility with the federal home loan bank  under which our banks are eligible for short term advances and long term borrowings secured by real estate loans or mortgage related investments 
our liquidity needs and funding are provided through non affiliated bank borrowing  cash dividends and tax payments from our subsidiary banks 
cash provided by operating activities for was million  consisting primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash items  loan loss provision which was offset by origination of loans held for sale and an increase in other assets 
cash used in investing activities was million  consisting primarily of increased loans of approximately million  purchases of held to maturity securities of million  and an increase in available for sale securities of million 
net activity in financing consisted of an increase in deposits of approximately million  principal payments on long term debt of million  and proceeds from issuance of long term debt of million  which resulted in net cash provided of million 
we and our subsidiaries actively monitor our compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
the elements of capital adequacy standards include strict definitions of core capital and total assets  which include off balance sheet items such as commitments to extend credit 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
historically  the banks have increased core capital through retention of earnings or capital infusions 
to be well capitalized a company s total risk based capital ratio  tier risk based capital ratio and tier leverage ratio would be at least  and  respectively 
our total risk based capital ratio  tier risk based capital ratio and tier leverage ratio at december  were  and  respectively 
these same ratios at december  were  and  respectively 
the principal source of funds at the holding company level is dividends from the banks 
the payment of dividends is subject to restrictions imposed by federal and state banking laws and regulations 
at december   our subsidiary banks could pay million in dividends to us and still remain well capitalized 
management believes funds generated from the dividends from our subsidiaries and our existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our current cash requirements 
however  if we continue at our current rate of internal growth  we will need to raise additional equity to remain well capitalized 
lasalle line of credit 
we have a revolving line of credit with lasalle bank national association lasalle credit line 
on july   we entered into an amendment with lasalle bank to reduce the maximum amount that we may borrow from million to million and extend the maturity date from july  to july  interest accrues on advances under the lasalle credit line at our option at a rate equal to either libor plus per annum or lasalle bank s prime rate but in no event will the interest rate under the lasalle credit line be less than per annum 
we draw on the lasalle credit line from time to time to fund various corporate matters including making contributions to our bank subsidiaries to help them maintain their well capitalized status 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance of approximately million on the lasalle credit line  which was paid off in the first quarter of as a result of the misappropriation of funds by mr 
gullion and the actions taken by the bank regulatory authorities in response thereto  we were in default under the lasalle credit line 
we have obtained a waiver from lasalle bank with respect to this default 
esop loan agreement 
under the amended and restated loan agreement  dated as of february  esop loan agreement  of our employees stock ownership plan the esop with lasalle bank  the esop may borrow up to million 
loans under the esop loan agreement bear interest  at the esop s option  at either lasalle bank s prime base rate or libor plus 
as of december   the esop has approximately million outstanding under the esop loan agreement  which it borrowed to purchase our common stock 
we guarantee the esop s obligations under the esop loan agreement 
we currently do not anticipate that the esop will need to borrower any further amounts under the esop loan agreement 
as a result of the misappropriation of funds by mr 
gullion and the actions taken by the bank regulatory authorities in response thereto  the esop was in default under the esop loan agreement 
we have obtained a waiver from lasalle bank with respect to this default 
federal home loan banks of des moines  topeka and atlanta 
gold bank kansas had approximately million outstanding as of december  under its credit agreement with federal home loan bank of des moines fhlb des moines

as of december   gold bank florida had approximately million of advances outstanding under its credit agreement with the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb atlanta 
the federal home loan banks of des moines and topeka could assert that the events described above under item of this annual report under the caption regulatory examinations and supervisory actions above permit them to declare gold bank kansas in default if such events were to have a material adverse effect on gold bank kansas 
we do not believe that such events have had a material adverse effect on gold bank kansas or that gold bank kansas is in default under these agreements 
however  neither the fhlb des moines or the fhlb topeka is willing to waive any potential defaults that might rise under the agreements if such events were to ultimately have a material adverse effect on gold bank kansas 
gullion restitution 
on may   gold bank kansas entered into a restitution agreement with mr 
gullion  pursuant which gold bank kansas received restitution of approximately million 
a more detailed discussion of this restitution agreement is set forth under note gullion restitution to the company s financial statements in the company s quarterly report on form q for the quarterly period ended september  on november   the company and gold bank kansas entered into a second restitution and settlement agreement with mr 
gullion 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this second restitution and settlement agreement  the company received a final restitution payment from mr 
gullion in the amount of million on november  as a condition of this second agreement  the company and mr 
gullion released any and all claims they may have against one another 
capital 
we and our subsidiaries actively monitor the subsidiaries compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
the elements of capital adequacy standards include strict definitions of core capital and total assets  which include off balance sheet items such as commitments to extend credit 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
historically  our banks have increased core capital through retention of earnings or capital infusions 
the primary source of funds available to us is dividends by our subsidiaries 
each bank s ability to pay dividends may be limited by regulatory requirements 
at december   our subsidiaries could pay dividends of million without prior regulatory approval 
boli policies 
the banks have purchased bank owned life insurance boli policies with death benefits payable to the banks on the lives of certain officers 
these single premium  whole life policies provide favorable tax benefits  but are illiquid investments 
federal guidelines limit a bank s aggregate investment in boli to of the banks capital and surplus  and its aggregate investment in boli policies from a single insurance company to of the bank s capital and surplus 
all of the banks boli investments comply with federal guidelines 
as of december   gold bank kansas had million of boli equal to of its capital and surplus compared to million of its capital and surplus as of december   an increase of million or 
as of december   gold bank oklahoma had million of boli equal to of its capital and surplus  compared to million of its capital and surplus as of december   an increase of million  or 
as of december   gold bank florida had million of boli equal to of its capital and surplus  compared to million of its capital and surplus as of december   an increase of million  or 
in january  gold bank kansas  gold bank oklahoma and gold bank florida increased their boli investments by million  million and million  respectively 
the aggregate boli investment of each bank is now just below the maximum regulatory limit 
the banks monitor the financial condition and credit rating of each of the three life insurance companies that issued the boli policies 
the company believes that these boli investments will not have any significant impact on the capital or liquidity of the banks 
compunet activities 
compunet engineering  inc  which was acquired in march  provides information technology  e commerce services and networking solutions for banks and other businesses 
under current federal reserve regulations  the data processing activities of a bank holding company and its subsidiaries must be done primarily for financial companies  and non financial data processing activities must be limited to of the bank holding company s total consolidated annual data processing revenues 
when the company acquired compunet  the aggregate data processing activities of the company and compunet complied with this limitation 
on december   the federal reserve published a proposed regulation that would permit a financial holding company to generate up to of its consolidated data processing revenue from non financial data processing activities 
the proposed regulation limits the investment of a financial holding company in such data processing activities to of the financial holding company s tier capital 
the comment period on the proposed regulation expired on february  in  compunet acquired the assets of information products  inc  which provides technology services  including lan  wan  product support  telecommunication line monitoring  hardware  maintenance and systems design and installation across all industry sectors 
this acquisition significantly increased the amount of compunet s non financial data processing activities 
for the year ended december   approximately of compunet s revenues were non financial in nature  and thus not in compliance with the federal reserve s current limitation 
on february   the company sold its interest in compunet engineering to computer source  inc commitments  contractual obligations  and off balance sheet arrangements various commitments and contingent liabilities arise in the normal course of business  which are not required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant of these are loan commitments totaling approximately million including approximately million in unused approved credit card lines and standby letters of credit  totaling approximately million at december  the company has various other financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as commercial letters of credit and commitments to purchase and sell when issued securities 
since many commitments expires unused or only partially used  these totals do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
management does not anticipate any material losses arising from commitments and contingent liabilities and believes there are no material commitments to extend credit that represent risks of an unusual nature

unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of a financial institution than do changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rate changes do not necessarily move in the same direction or have the same magnitude as changes in the prices of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management refers to management s efforts to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by interest rate changes 
this is accomplished by managing the repricing of interest rate sensitive interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
an interest rate sensitive balance sheet item is one that is able to reprice quickly through maturity or otherwise 
controlling the maturity or repricing of an institution s liabilities and assets in order to minimize interest rate risk is commonly referred to as gap management 
close matching of the repricing of assets and liabilities will normally result in little change in net interest income when interest rates change 
a mismatched gap position will normally result in changes in net interest income as interest rates change 
along with internal gap management reports  we and our banks use an asset liability modeling service to analyze each bank s current gap position 
the system simulates our banks asset and liability base and projects future net interest income results under several interest rate assumptions 
we strive to maintain an aggregate gap position such that changes in interest rates will not affect net interest income by more than in any month period 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to assist in the management of interest rate sensitivity as described under item management s discussion and analysis of results of operation and financial condition 
the use of such derivative financial instruments is intended to reduce the company s interest rate exposure 
the following table indicates that  at december   if there had been a sudden and sustained increase in prevailing market interest rates  our net interest income would be expected to increase  while a decrease in rates would indicate a decrease in income 
changes in interest rate net interest income change percent change dollars in thousands basis point rise basis point rise base rate scenario basis point decline basis point decline
