item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded as a solutions oriented company  designing and manufacturing products to suppress or eliminate electromagnetic interference emi 
in recent years  we broadened our focus and product lines to become a control products and systems company  providing a wide range of components and systems used to condition  regulate  transmit  receive  or govern electronic performance 
although our components and systems are used in many industries worldwide  our largest markets are telecommunications equipment and military aerospace which represented and  respectively  of our fiscal sales 
in telecommunications  our products are used in numerous systems including wireless base stations  broadband switching equipment  global positioning systems  and optical networks 
military aerospace applications for our products include missile defense systems  smart weapons and munitions  secure communications  simulation equipment  and avionic upgrades 
automotive represents an emerging market for our products  with significant applications in dc motors  telematics  and electronic safety controls 
other markets for our products include medical instrumentation  industrial equipment  computers  and storage devices 
our operations are currently conducted in three reportable segments signal integrity products  power integrity products and management systems  and frequency control products 
our signal integrity products group designs and manufactures a broad range of low pass emi filters  surface mount emi filters  filtered arrays  filtered connectors  specialty ceramic capacitors  and our newly developed motor line feed thru mlft filters 
our power integrity products and management systems group designs and manufactures numerous power integrity products power line filters  power entry modules  multisection filters  power terminal blocks  and custom power filter assemblies and power management systems power distribution units  remote power management and monitoring systems  fuse interface panels  breaker interface panels  and custom power distribution systems 
our recently developed frequency control products group designs and manufactures ceramic resonators and bandpass filters  ceramic patch antennas  duplexers  lumped element filters  cavity filters  waveguide filters  and related products and systems 
acquisition on july   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of fsy microwave  inc fsy 
fsy  based in columbia maryland  designs and manufactures various microwave filters  including lumped element filters  cavity filters  waveguide filters  and related products and systems 
these products are a natural complement and extension to our ceramic based wireless product offerings of resonators  bandpass filters  and patch antennas 
in addition  we believe our low cost manufacturing capability and established sales channels will provide additional revenue opportunities for fsy products 
the aggregate cash purchase price for fsy was approximately million  including legal fees and other costs directly related to the acquisition 
the purchase price was entirely funded through our available cash reserves 
the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
accordingly  fsy net sales of million and million have been included in our consolidated net sales for the years ended november  and  respectively 
for operating segment purposes  these sales are reported within our frequency control products group 
adoption of new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are instead subject to a periodic impairment test at least annually 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued effective december   we adopted sfas no 
accordingly  no amortization of goodwill was recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended november  and  compared to  for the year ended november  as required by sfas no 
 prior year results have not been restated 
if we had discontinued amortization of goodwill at the beginning of fiscal year  net loss for the year ended november  would have decreased  or four cents per share 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended november  and forward looking information the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including statements regarding our belief as to future market conditions and operating margins  our projected capital expenditures  our anticipated research and development expenses  and our expected future operating requirements and financing needs 
the words believe  expect  anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed in risk factors that may affect future results  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table sets forth our net sales by reportable operating segments for the years ended november    and in thousands signal integrity products power integrity products and management systems frequency control products compared to net sales consolidated net sales increased by million or from in addition to fsy product sales  this increase reflects greater shipment volume for substantially all of our signal and power integrity product lines 
sales of signal integrity products amounted to million in  up million from the preceding year 
power integrity product sales increased by million in  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal these sales increases primarily reflect improved overall market conditions within the telecommunications equipment industry and increased demand for our military related products 
sales of power management systems were constant throughout the period at million in and sales of frequency control products totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal fsy product sales generated million of this million increase in frequency control product sales  with the remaining increase reflecting additional shipment volume of ceramic resonators  bandpass filters and patch antennas 
average selling prices remained relatively stable throughout all of our product lines 
total customer orders received in amounted to million  an increase of million or from the preceding year 
gross margin gross margin in fiscal was million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the gross margin in was significantly below historical levels  primarily reflecting lower than anticipated sales volume and manufacturing inefficiencies caused by an abrupt downturn in product demand by our telecommunications equipment customers 
throughout fiscal  we identified and implemented numerous cost reduction programs to better align our operations with current business expectations 
these cost reduction programs included consolidating certain of our pennsylvania manufacturing facilities to decrease manufacturing overhead  transferring the production of most of our commercial products to our low cost manufacturing center in juarez mexico to reduce labor costs  and generating greater utilization of our metal fabrication operations in wesson mississippi to lower material costs 
as a result of these efforts  and economies of scale realized with higher shipment levels  gross margin in fiscal year improved significantly 
at november   we had a total workforce of employees  approximately the same as a year ago 
we expect to continuously review our organization and cost structure to further improve operating efficiencies  while maintaining flexibility for future capacity expansion 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal  selling expense amounted to million or of sales  compared to million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  principally reflects the impact of higher sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
in addition  effective sales commission rates decreased in general and administrative expense was approximately million in and million in the increase in general and administrative expense primarily reflects additional personnel costs  including performance based compensation 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other income and expense interest expense was relatively constant during the period  amounting to  in fiscal and  in fiscal we hold numerous united states and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer pml technology 
we realized license fee income of  in and  in upon the granting of pml technology licenses 
although these licenses  as well as other pml licenses that we have previously granted  require certain royalties to be paid to us upon the sale of products utilizing pml technology  it is not known what future commercial value  if any  these patents and related licenses may have 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency 
as a result  we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses  however  were not material in any of the periods presented herein 
we realized interest income of  in and  in from temporary cash investments 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets  including us federal net operating loss carryforwards of  and state net operating loss carryforwards of  expiring at varying amounts through in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon our level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset valuation allowance was recorded at november  compared to net sales consolidated net sales decreased by million or from this decrease  which was reflected throughout all of our major product lines  was primarily driven by an unprecedented slowdown in the telecommunications equipment industry and sluggish overall economic conditions in the united states and europe 
sales of signal integrity products amounted to million in  compared to million in sales of power integrity products decreased by million in  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales of our newly introduced power management systems amounted to million in and million in although we believe the long term market potential for these advanced systems remains strong  their initial sales introduction and penetration was severely hampered by poor market conditions throughout the telecommunications equipment industry 
sales of frequency control products totaled million in fiscal  including fsy product sales of million 
sales of frequency control products were million in fiscal as a result of competitive pressures  average selling prices declined slightly in throughout most of our product lines 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overall demand for our products was very soft in with total customer orders of million  a decrease of million or from in addition to these customer orders  we assumed approximately million of customer order backlog in connection with the acquisition of fsy 
at november   our consolidated sales order backlog was million  up million from the end of fiscal early in  the telecommunications equipment market began to experience a severe industry wide downturn 
this downturn was driven by several factors  including the collapse of numerous start up  competitive service providers and dot coms resulting in excess component inventories  unsold telecom systems  and a secondary market of used equipment throughout the telecommunications industry and reduced spending for infrastructure and network equipment by incumbent telephone service providers as competitive pressures from start up providers eased  certain technological advances stalled  and economic recessionary pressures grew 
in fiscal  this severe downturn demonstrated some signs of moderating 
customer order cancellations and delivery date pushouts  which were prevalent throughout  significantly diminished in fiscal although we believe the prolonged market downturn bottomed out in fiscal  overall market demand continues to be unpredictable with the timing and extent of the market s recovery remaining uncertain 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty when a full recovery in capital spending may be expected  nor can we forecast what normal customer spending levels may be once this structural market correction is completed 
restructuring charges in fiscal  we adopted and implemented a plan to restructure our operations and reduce operating expenses in response to the severe slowdown in the global telecommunications equipment market 
the restructuring plan was intended to reduce excess manufacturing capacity  improve efficiencies  and align our operations with current business expectations 
the plan included consolidating manufacturing facilities  writing off slow moving inventories  and disposing of excess property and equipment 
in connection with this plan  we recorded restructuring charges of  in these restructuring charges consisted of employee severance costs and losses on the disposal of excess fixed assets 
in addition  we increased our inventory reserves for excess and slow moving items by million 
these additional inventory reserves were included in cost of products sold for fiscal year ended november  gross margin gross margin was million or of sales in fiscal  compared to million or of sales in fiscal in  gross margin was reduced by million from the additional inventory reserves previously discussed 
in  gross margin was negatively impacted by lower sales volume and manufacturing inefficiencies caused by the abrupt downturn in product demand by our telecommunications customers 
in addition to our formal restructuring plan  we identified and implemented numerous cost reduction programs throughout fiscal year as a result of these efforts  gross margin in fiscal was expected to approximate to of net sales 
this gross margin improvement was achieved in at november   we had a total workforce of employees  including fsy personnel of at november   we had a total workforce of employees 
selling  general and administrative expense selling expense was million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in the increase in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  reflects the impact of lower sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
this impact was partially offset by lower effective sales commission rates  reduced advertising expenses  and decreased personnel costs 
general and administrative expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease in general and administrative expense primarily reflects lower personnel costs and the reduction of certain variable expenditures for professional services 
in addition   of goodwill amortization was recorded and included in general and administrative expense in fiscal with the adoption of sfas no 
 no goodwill amortization was recorded in fiscal year in november  we sold certain land and building in erie  pennsylvania 
manufacturing at this site had consisted of various power integrity products and management systems 
these product lines and operations were subsequently integrated into our fairview  pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
net proceeds realized from the sale amounted to  with a loss of  recognized on the sale and included in general and administrative expense in fiscal of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in fiscal  as part of our formal plan to consolidate manufacturing facilities and dispose of excess property and equipment  we closed two operating facilities in elizabethtown  pennsylvania 
manufacturing in these facilities had consisted of certain wireless products  specialty ceramic capacitors  and other signal integrity products 
these operations were consolidated into our manufacturing facilities in juarez  mexico and new orleans  louisiana 
in march  the two elizabethtown facilities and related excess equipment were sold 
net proceeds realized from the sale amounted to approximately million  and a gain of  was recorded and included in general and administrative expense in fiscal other income and expense interest expense decreased by  during the period  from  in to  in the decrease in interest expense primarily reflects reduced bank indebtedness 
in  other income consists of interest income from short term investments of  pml license fee income of  and net losses on foreign currency transactions of  in  other income reflects  of pml license fee income   of interest income  and  of foreign currency transaction gains 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
risk factors that may affect future results in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were to customers in the telecommunications industry 
our three largest customers  original equipment manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  represented an aggregate of our total consolidated net sales in throughout most of the last three years  the telecommunications equipment industry experienced a severe slowdown 
presently  market conditions continue to be volatile and unpredictable 
if the current market conditions deteriorate  it will have a material negative impact on our future operating performance 
in addition  our results of operations may be negatively affected in the future by a variety of other factors including competitive pricing pressures  new technologies which decrease the demand for our products  new product offerings by our competitors  product cost changes  changes in the overall economic climate  cancellation of existing customer order backlog  unanticipated impairment of assets  changes in the availability of raw materials  and changes in product mix 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we maintain a million line of credit with our principal lending institution  pnc bank  na of erie pennsylvania the bank  with interest rates on borrowings at or below the prevailing prime rate 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness 
at november   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
our ability to borrow in the future under this credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants 
whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future  for which there can be no assurance 
effective february   the line of credit agreement was amended 
under the amended agreement  future borrowings  if any  will be secured by our accounts receivable 
the amended line of credit agreement expires on april  our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains an unsecured euro line of credit with a german financial institution aggregating approximately million euro million 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
future borrowings  if any  will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand 
overall  our net working capital remains relatively stable 
at november   we had net working capital of million  compared to million at november  and million at november  our current ratio is very strong with current assets times current liabilities at november   compared to at november  and at november  of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in response to the uncertain overall market conditions  and as part of our related cost containment programs  we continue to control our capital expenditures to minimum required amounts 
in  our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to  these capital expenditures were primarily for routine replacement of fixed assets  as well as manufacturing equipment and tooling for our recently established china manufacturing operations 
our china manufacturing operations are conducted in a modern  square foot facility  located in the guangdong province of southern china 
in addition to supplying product to our china customers  we expect this operation to ultimately enable us to participate in new asian markets 
at november   we had not entered into any material commitments for capital expenditures 
in  our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to  these capital expenditures were primarily for manufacturing equipment and tooling to enhance efficiencies in our ceramic capacitor operations and our power management systems product offerings 
in  capital expenditures of million were primarily incurred during the first half of the year for manufacturing equipment and tooling to enhance operating efficiencies and increase capacity for certain signal and power integrity product lines 
in  as part of our efforts to consolidate manufacturing facilities and dispose of excess property and equipment  we sold certain land  building and equipment located in elizabethtown and erie  pennsylvania 
manufacturing previously conducted at these sites has been transferred and successfully integrated into our other production facilities 
net proceeds realized from the sale of these assets was approximately million 
as previously indicated  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of fsy in july  the net cash purchase price for fsy was million  excluding possible future contingent payments 
this net cash purchase price was entirely funded through available cash reserves 
the amount of contingent payments will be determined based upon the increase in sales of the acquired product lines during the three years subsequent to the acquisition date 
during the first year subsequent to the acquisition date  contingent payments will be earned if fsy s annual product sales for the year exceed million 
the contingent payment amount will be equal to of such sales in excess of million 
contingent payments earned in the second and third year following the acquisition date will be determined in a similar manner  except the calculation will apply a rate of in year two and in year three to the annual sales in excess of million 
contingent payments earned  if any  will be paid in cash within days following the close of the applicable period of calculation 
during the first year subsequent to the acquisition date  no contingent payments were earned or paid 
we have adopted a stock repurchase program 
under this program  we may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices 
funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the company s capital structure  liquidity  and the market price of the company s common stock 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
during fiscal year   shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of  repurchases totaled  shares in fiscal and  shares in fiscal at an aggregate cost of million and million  respectively 
since the inception of the stock repurchase program   shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million 
research and development expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes  amounted to million in and  and million in we expect to continue our investment in research and development in  as we continuously enhance existing product lines  design new signal and power integrity products  further develop our frequency control and power management systems product offerings  and increase our participation in emerging markets such as automotive 
income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november   and amounted to   and million  respectively 
as a result of operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets  we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be significantly less than income tax expense for fiscal year as of november   our obligations and firm commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued current financial resources  including working capital and existing lines of credit  and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year  including scheduled long term debt repayment  lease commitments  planned capital equipment expenditures  research and development expenses  and possible stock repurchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
despite increases in certain working capital requirements  our operating cash flow remained strong in net cash generated by operating activities amounted to million in  compared to million in with greater sales volume in  accounts receivable increased by million 
operating cash flow in fiscal reflects the refund of million of federal income taxes from prior year net operating loss carrybacks and overpayments 
in addition  as a result of improved turnover rates  accounts receivable and inventories decreased in by million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  operating cash flow was positively impacted by reductions in certain working capital requirements 
in particular  as a result of lower sales volume in  accounts receivable decreased by million 
at november   goodwill represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
in addition to million of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition of fsy  a majority of our recorded goodwill was recognized in in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the signal conditioning products division of amp incorporated 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 effective december   we have performed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the years ended november  and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and other local currencies 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to the euro and british pound sterling  we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
at november   we did not have any forward currency exchange contracts outstanding 
for each of the three years ended november   currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material 
interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at november   no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding 
environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries 
us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition to these federal agencies  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of our continuing environmental program  we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns  or both 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that was acquired before february  in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for hedging activities and derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts 
the statement clarifies the circumstances in which a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristics of a derivative and when a derivative contains a financing component  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
also requires disclosures about alternative ways of settling financial instruments and the capital structure of entities whose shares are mandatorily redeemable 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  these recent accounting pronouncements fin  sfas no 
 and sfas no 
did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position as presented herein 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the prior disclosure guidance and requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are generally effective for fiscal years ending after december  while we have elected not to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  we have complied herein with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
the interpretation expands on the accounting guidance of fasb statements no 
  and  and incorporates without change the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of the interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have complied herein with the requirements of fin critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customer s financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due 
at november   our allowance for doubtful accounts was  or approximately of our aggregate accounts receivable 
in determining the adequacy of this allowance  we have assumed that the severe downturn in the telecommunications equipment industry stabilized in fiscal if market conditions deteriorate further  our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us 
accordingly  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
at november   we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of million for excess and slow moving items 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage 
should these forecasts and estimates change due to market  technological or other factors  the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 we review goodwill for possible impairment at least annually 
impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors  including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of possible impairment exist 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying values 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
however  our future cash flow expectations assume that market conditions throughout the telecommunications equipment industry will begin to improve significantly in if long term market conditions do not improve significantly  our long lived assets may become materially impaired 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
presently  we believe that all deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is not required 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed 
these adjustments  when made  may have a materially negative impact on our financial statements
