in addition  the company and bank have administrative headquarters at east shaw avenue  fresno  california  at december   the consolidated company had approximately million in total assets  million in net loans  million in deposits  and million in shareholders equity 
the following discussion of the company s services should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
bank services as a state chartered commercial bank  united security bank offers a full range of commercial banking services primarily to the business and professional community and individuals located in fresno and madera counties 
the bank offers a wide range of deposit instruments including personal and business checking accounts and savings accounts  interest bearing negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market accounts and time certificates of deposit 
most of the bank s deposits are attracted from individuals and from small and medium sized business related sources 
the bank also engages in a full complement of lending activities  including real estate mortgage  commercial and industrial  real estate construction  as well as agricultural  lease financing  and consumer loans  with particular emphasis on short and medium term obligations 
the bank s loan portfolio is not concentrated in any one industry  although approximately of the bank s loans are secured by real estate 
a loan may be secured in whole or in part by real estate even though the purpose of the loan is not to facilitate the purchase or development of real estate 
at december   the bank had loans net of unearned fees outstanding of million  which represented approximately of the bank s total deposits and approximately of its total assets 
real estate mortgage loans are secured by deeds of trust primarily on commercial property 
repayment of real estate mortgage loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower 
commercial and industrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification 
loans may be originated in the company s market area  or participated with other financial institutions outside the company s market area 
a substantial portion of the commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable  inventory  leases or other collateral 
the remainder are unsecured  however extensions of credit are predicated on the financial capacity of the borrower 
repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower 
real estate construction loans consist of loans to residential contractors  which are secured by single family residential properties 
all real estate loans have established equity requirements 
repayment of real estate construction loans is generally from long term mortgages with other lending institutions 
agricultural loans are generally secured by land  equipment  inventory and receivables 
repayment of this loan category is from the cash flow of the borrower 
in the normal course of business  the bank makes various loan commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities 
at december  and  loan commitments of the bank aggregated million and million  respectively 
of the million in loan commitments outstanding at december   million or were on loans with maturities of one year or less 
due to the nature of the business of the bank s customers  there are no seasonal patterns or absolute predictability to the utilization of unused loan commitments  therefore the bank is unable to forecast the extent to which these commitments will be exercised within the current year 
the bank does not believe that any such utilization will constitute a material liquidity demand 
in addition to the loan and deposit services discussed above  the bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs of commercial customers and account holders 
these services include cashier s checks  traveler s checks  money orders  and foreign drafts 
the bank does not operate a trust department  however  it makes arrangements with its correspondent bank to offer trust services to its customers on request 
most of the bank s business originates within fresno and madera counties 
neither the bank s business or liquidity is seasonal  and there has been no material effect upon the bank s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position as a result of federal  state or local environmental regulation 
competition and market share the banking business in california generally  and in the market area served by the company specifically  is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits 
the company competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions and other financial institutions  including a number that are substantially larger than the company 
deregulation of the banking industry  increased competition from non bank entities for the cash balances of individuals and businesses  and continuing developments in the computer and communications industries have had  and most likely will continue to have  a significant impact on the company s competitive position 
with the enactment of interstate banking legislation in california  bank holding companies headquartered outside of california may enter the california market and provide further competition for the company 
additionally  with the gramm leach bliley act of  traditional competitive barriers between insurance companies  securities underwriters  and commercial banks have been eased  allowing a greater number of financial intermediaries to offer a wider assortment of financial services 
many of the major commercial banks operating in the company s market areas offer certain services such as trust and international banking services  which the company does not offer directly 
in addition  banks with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve larger customers 
the company s primary market area is located in fresno and madera counties  in which approximately fdic insured financial institutions compete for business 
the following table sets forth information regarding deposit market share and ranking by county as of june   which is the most current information available 
rank share fresno county madera county total of fresno and madera counties supervision and regulation the company the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc act  and is registered as such with the frb 
a bank holding company is required to file with the frb annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries and is also subject to examination by the frb 
the bhc act requires  among other things  prior approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock of that bank 
the bhc act also provides that the frb shall not approve any acquisition that would result in or further the creation of a monopoly  or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition  unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the probable effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the community served 
furthermore  under the bhc act  a bank holding company is  with limited exceptions  prohibited from i acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or ii engaging in any activity other than managing or controlling banks 
with the prior approval of the frb  however  a bank holding company may own shares of a company engaged in activities which the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto 
the bhc act requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
it is the frb s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting a subsidiary bank 
under certain conditions  the frb may conclude that certain actions of a bank holding company  such as payment of cash dividends  would constitute unsafe and unsound banking practices because they violate the frb s source of strength doctrine 
a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  a bank may not condition an extension of credit on a promise by its customer to obtain other services by it  its holding company or other subsidiaries  or on a promise by its customer not to obtain services from a competitor 
in addition  federal law imposes certain restrictions between the company and its subsidiaries  including the bank 
as an affiliate of the bank  the company is subject  with certain exceptions  to provisions of federal law imposing limitations on  and requiring collateral for  extensions of credit by the bank to its affiliates 
in the gramm leach bliley act the glba was enacted 
the glba became effective in march of and is a financial services modernization law that  among other things  facilitates broad new affiliations among securities firms  insurance companies and bank holding companies by repealing the year old provisions of the glass steagall act 
the glba allows the formation of financial holding companies fhc s  which are bank holding companies with substantially expanded powers 
a bank holding company must acquire the approval of the frb to become a fhc 
under these expanded powers  affiliations may occur between bank holding companies  securities firms and insurance companies  subject to a blend of umbrella supervision and regulation of the newly formed consolidated entity by the federal reserve  oversight of the fhc s bank and thrift subsidiaries by their primary federal and state banking regulators and financial regulation of the fhc s nonbank subsidiaries by their respective specialized regulators 
the company has not applied to become a fhc 
the company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  which include but are not limited to the filing of annual  quarterly and other current reports with the sec 
the bank the bank as a state chartered bank  is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the california department of financial institutions 
in addition  the bank is also a member of the federal reserve system and  as such  is subject to applicable provisions of the federal reserve act and regulations issued thereunder and  is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the board of governors 
the bank is subject to california law  insofar as they are not preempted by federal banking law 
deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic in an amount up to  per customer  and  as such  the bank is subject to the regulations of the fdic and the federal deposit insurance act 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in california and the united states  the bank s business is particularly susceptible to changes in california and federal legislation and regulation  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting permissible activities or increasing competition 
various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of california affect the operations of the bank 
federal and california statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including capital requirements and disclosure requirements to depositors and borrowers  requirements to maintain reserves against deposits  limitations on interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  and restrictions on borrowings and on payment of dividends 
the dfi regulates the number and location of branch offices of a state chartered bank  and may permit a bank to maintain branches only to the extent allowable under state law for state banks 
california law presently permits a bank to locate a branch in any locality in the state 
additionally  california law exempts banks from california usury laws 
effect of governmental policies and recent legislation banking has traditionally been a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans extended to its customers and securities held in the company s portfolio comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including  but not limited to  inflation  recession and unemployment 
the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements  and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks which are members of the federal reserve system 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact that future changes in fiscal or monetary policies or economic controls may have on the company s business and earnings cannot be predicted 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting the company s net income 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood of any major change and the impact such change may have on the company is impossible to predict 
certain of the potentially significant changes which have been enacted recently and other which are currently under consideration by congress or various regulatory agencies or professional agencies are discussed below 
recent legislation and other changes during july  president bush signed into law the sarbanes oxley act of the purpose of the sarbanes oxley act is to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws  and for other purposes

equity investments through sbics will be exempt from the new charges to the extent such investments  in the aggregate  do not exceed percent of the banking organization s tier capital 
the new charges would not apply to individual investments made by banking organizations prior to march  grandfathered investments made by state banks under section f of the federal deposit insurance act also are exempted from coverage

the gramm leach bliley act glba was enacted in late glba  among other things  repeals the glass steagall act

in addition  glba allows for a new type of bank holding company under the bank holding company act

financial activities include  as well as lending  providing insurance as an agent  broker or as principal  issuing annuities  underwriting  and dealing in or making a market in securities

is followed by glba  and glba further provides that no state may  by statute  regulation  order  interpretation  or other action  prevent or significantly interfere with the ability of an insured depository institution  or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof  to engage  directly or indirectly  either by itself or in conjunction with a subsidiary  affiliate  or any other party  in any insurance sales  solicitation  or cross marketing activity 
the community reinvestment act provisions in glba require that any new bank holding company that is formed meet the conditions that all of the company s insured depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed or received at least a satisfactory rating in the most recent community reinvestment act examination

in addition  the company has been able to obtain time deposits from the state of california  which totaled million  million  and million at december   and  respectively 
the time deposits of the state of california are collateralized by pledged securities in the company s investment portfolio 
the company s deposit base consists of two major components represented by noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing deposits 
interest bearing deposits consist of time certificates  now and money market accounts and savings deposits 
total interest bearing deposits increased million or between december  and december   while noninterest bearing deposits increased million or between the same two periods presented 
between december  and december   total interest bearing deposits increased million or  while noninterest bearing deposits increased million or 
on a year to date average  the company experienced an increase of million or in total deposits between the years ended december  and december  between these two periods  average interest bearing deposits increased million or  while total noninterest bearing checking increased million or on a year to date average basis 
on average  the company experienced increases in all deposit categories between the years ended december  and december   except time deposits  which decreased million on average during on a year to date average basis  total deposits increased million or between the years ended december  and december  of that total  interest bearing deposits increased by million or  while noninterest bearing deposits increased million or during the most significant increases experienced in average deposits during were in time deposits  money market accounts  and noninterest bearing accounts

short term borrowings the company has the ability to obtain borrowed funds consisting of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank fhlb advances as alternatives to retail deposit funds 
the company has established collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit with several correspondent banks  as well as a securities dealer  for the purpose of obtaining borrowed funds as needed 
the company may continue to borrow funds in the future as part of its asset liability strategy  and may use these funds to acquire certain other assets as deemed appropriate by management for investment purposes and to better utilize the capital resources of the bank 
federal funds purchased represent temporary overnight borrowings from correspondent banks and are generally unsecured 
repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgage backed securities and securities of us government agencies  and generally have maturities of one to six months  but may have longer maturities if deemed appropriate as part of the company s asset liability management strategy 
fhlb advances are collateralized by the company s stock in the fhlb  securities  and certain qualifying mortgage loans 
in addition  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco  which would be collateralized by certain pledged loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the lines of credit are subject to periodic review of the company s financial statements by the grantors of the credit lines 
lines of credit may be modified or revoked at any time if the grantors feel there are adverse trends in the company s financial position 
the company had collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit aggregating million and million  as well as fhlb lines of credit totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
these lines of credit generally have interest rates tied to the federal funds rate or are indexed to short term us treasury rates or libor

implicit in lending activities is the fact that losses will be experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary from time to time  depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans and commitments to extend credit  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  collateral  and concentrations of credit 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and the state of the local economy 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  the company follows  in accordance with gaap  the guidelines set forth in the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses statement issued jointly by banking regulators during july the statement outlines characteristics that should be used in segmentation of the loan portfolio for purposes of the analysis including risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
it also outlines factors to consider when adjusting the loss factors for various segments of the loan portfolio 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
was also released at this time which represents the sec staff s view relating to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 
it is also generally consistent with the guidance published by the banking regulators 
the company segments the loan and lease portfolio into eleven segments  primarily by loan class and type  that have homogeneity and commonality of purpose and terms for analysis under sfas no 
those loans which are determined to be impaired under sfas no 
are not subject to the general reserve analysis under sfas no 
 and evaluated individually for specific impairment 
the eleven segments of the company s loan portfolio are as follows subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile the amounts to the company s loan classification reported elsewhere in these financial statements loan segments for loan loss reserve analysis loan balance at december  dollars in s commercial and business loans government program loans total commercial and industrial commercial real estate term loans single family residential loans home improvement home equity loans total real estate mortgage total real estate construction loans total agricultural loans consumer loans overdraft protection lines overdrafts total instalment other total lease financing total loans the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance  specific allowances for problem graded loans classified loans and the unallocated allowance in addition  the allowance analysis also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans as provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unfunded loan commitments 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience and on the internal risk grade of those loans and  may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
factors that may affect collectibility of the loan portfolio include levels of  and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans  trends in volumes and term of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  collection  charge off  and recovery  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions and  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio  including high balance loan concentrations and participations 
management determines the loss factors for problem graded loans substandard  doubtful  and loss  special mention loans  and pass graded loans  based on a loss migration model 
the migration analysis incorporates loan losses over the past twelve quarters three years and loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
for purposes of this analysis  loans are grouped by internal risk classifications  which are pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
certain loans are homogenous in nature and are therefore pooled by risk grade 
these homogenous loans include consumer installment and home equity loans 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard  doubtful  and loss 
loan participations are reviewed for allowance adequacy under the same guidelines as other loans in the company s portfolio  with an additional participation factor added  if required  for specific risks associated with participations 
in general  participations are subject to certain thresholds set by the company  and are reviewed for geographic location as well as the well being of the underlying agent bank 
the formula allowance includes reserves for certain off balance sheet risks including letters of credit  unfunded loan commitments  and lines of credit 
reserves for undisbursed commitments are generally formula allocations based on the company s historical loss experience and other loss factors  rather than specific loss contingencies 
the reserves for these off balance sheet commitments are included in the company s allowance for credit losses  rather than a separate liability on the balance sheet because the reserve amounts are considered to be immaterial in relation to total liabilities 
at december   and the formula reserve allocated to undisbursed commitments totaled   and  respectively 
specific allowances are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified loans  impaired loans  and other loans in which management believes there is a probability that a loss has been incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance 
specific allowance amounts include those calculated under sfas no 
under sfas no 
 specific allowances are determined based on the collateralized value of the underlying properties  the net present value of the anticipated cash flows  or the market value of the underlying assets 
under sfas no 
 specific allowances  where required  are determined on the basis of additional risks involved with individual loans that may be in excess of risk factors associated with the loan portfolio as a whole 
the specific allowance is different from the formula allowance in that the specific allowance is determined on a loan by loan basis based on risk factors directly related to a particular loan  as opposed to the formula allowance which is determined for a pool of loans with similar characteristics  based on past historical trends and other risk factors which may be relevant on an ongoing basis 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is the result of both expected and unanticipated changes in various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 
the company s methodology includes features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses 
the specific allowance portion of the analysis is designed to be self correcting by taking into account the current loan loss experience based on that portion of the portfolio 
by analyzing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates using the most recent information available 
in performing the periodic migration analysis  management believes that historical loss factors used in the computation of the formula allowance need to be adjusted to reflect current changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
there are a number of other factors which are reviewed when determining adjustments in the historical loss factors 
they include trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans  trends in loan volume and terms  effects of changes in lending policies  concentrations of credit  competition  national and local economic trends and conditions  experience of lending staff  loan review and board of directors oversight  high balance loan concentration  and other business conditions 
the ninth factor above for high balance loan concentration was added during  and as a result  the impact to the allowance for credit losses for the inclusion of that factor amounted to approximately  and  for and  respectively 
other than the added factor just mentioned  there were no changes in estimation methods or assumptions during that affected the methodology for assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management and the company s lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a weekly monthly basis and through discussions and officer meetings as conditions change 
the company s loan committee meets weekly and serves as a forum to discuss specific problem assets that pose significant concerns to the company  and to keep the board of directors informed through committee minutes 
all special mention and classified loans are reported quarterly on criticized asset reports which are reviewed by senior management 
with this information  the migration analysis and the impaired loan analysis are performed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are made to the allowance as deemed necessary 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans  restructured debt  and currently performing loans in which full payment of principal or interest is not expected 
management bases the measurement of these impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral or the expected cash flows on the loans discounted at the loan s stated interest rates 
cash receipts on impaired loans not performing to contractual terms and that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce principal balances 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to the provision  if applicable 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary differences between impaired loans and nonperforming loans are i all loan categories are considered in determining nonperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial and industrial loans  commercial and residential real estate loans  construction loans  and agricultural loans  and ii impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include problem loans other than delinquent loans 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled million and million  respectively 
included in total impaired loans at december   is million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
total impaired loans at december  included million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
in the case of certain troubled debt restructuring for which the loan is performing under the current contractual terms  income is recognized under the accrual method 
for the year ended december   the company recognized no income on such loans 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized  and  respectively  of income on such loans 
the company focuses on competition and other economic conditions within its market area  which may ultimately affect the risk assessment of the portfolio 
the company continues to experience increased competition from major banks  local independents and non bank institutions creating pressure on loan pricing 
with interest rates at historical lows  the economic recovery has been slow in coming  however the recovery began to gain momentum during the last half of both business and consumer spending improved during the third quarter of  with gdp of more than being reported during the quarter 
gdp during the fourth quarter of was and is expected to remain at that level throughout it is difficult to determine whether the federal reserve will adjust interest rates in an effort to control the economy  however interest rate increases are anticipated during the later part of it is likely that the business environment in california will continue to be influenced by these domestic as well as global events 
the local market has improved economically during the current year while the rest of the state and the nation has experienced slowed economic growth 
the local area market has not been as volatile as those of san francisco and other areas  which should bode well for sustained growth in the company s market areas of fresno and madera counties 
local unemployment rates remain high primarily as a result of the areas agricultural dynamics  however unemployment rates are expected to improve nationally during it is difficult to predict what impact this will have on the local economy 
the company believes that the central san joaquin valley will continue to grow and diversify as property and housing costs remain reasonable relative to other areas of the state  although this growth may begin to slow as the federal reserve raises interest rates to control what it perceives as an accelerating economy 
management recognizes increased risk of loss due to the company s exposure from local and worldwide economic conditions  as well as potentially volatile real estate markets  and takes these factors into consideration when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the following table provides a summary of the company s allowance for credit losses  provisions made to that allowance  and charge off and recovery activity affecting the allowance for the years indicated 
december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding at end of period before deducting allowances for credit losses average net loans outstanding during period balance of allowance at beginning of period loans charged off real estate commercial and industrial lease financing installment and other total loans charged off recoveries of loans previously charged off real estate commercial and industrial lease financing installment and other total loan recoveries net loans charged off provision charged to operating expense balance of allowance for credit losses at end of period net loan charge offs to total average loans net loan charge offs to loans at end of period allowance for credit losses to total loans at end of period net loan charge offs to allowance for credit losses net loan charge offs to provision for credit losses management believes that the credit loss allowance to total loans at december  is adequate to absorb known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
no assurance can be given  however  that the economic conditions which may adversely affect the company s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management is not currently aware of any conditions that may adversely affect the levels of losses incurred in the company s loan portfolio 
although the company does not normally allocate the allowance for credit losses to specific loan categories  an allocation to the major categories has been made for the purposes of this report as set forth in the following table 
the allocations are estimates based on the same factors as considered by management in determining the amount of additional provisions to the credit loss allowance and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses of loans allowance for loan losses of loans allowance for loan losses of loans allowance for loan losses of loans allowance for loan losses of loans commercial and industrial real estate mortgage real estate construction agricultural installment other lease financing not allocated the increase in reserve allocations for lease financing loans between and is the result of the nonperformance of a purchased lease portfolio totaling million 
this lease portfolio is an impaired credit on non accrual and has a specific allowance of million allocated to it at december  the specific allowance was determined based on an estimate of expected future cash flows 
the guarantor of those leases has entered court proceedings to discharge their guarantee based on the fact that many of the underlying leases were fraudulent 
the company  based upon advice from their counsel  does not believe it is probable the guarantors fraud defense will prevail and intends to vigorously pursue the guarantee 
the company believes the specific allowance as determined under sfas no 
is adequate to cover probable losses for this lease portfolio 
during a recent regulatory examination  the lease portfolio in question was classified as doubtful by the bank s regulators based upon state regulatory guidelines 
california state statute no 
requires that a credit where interest is past due and unpaid for more than one year  is not well secured and not in the process of collection be charged off 
the regulators have requested that the bank charge off the principle balance in the first or second quarter of for regulatory purposes if the judge has not made a ruling or no principle payments have been made by these dates 
the company believes that under generally accepted accounting principles  a total loss of principal is not probable and the allowance calculated under sfas no 
is adequate 
at this time it is uncertain how much the company will collect  however management believes the company will collect part  if not all  of the amounts due 
the allowance allocation attributable to commercial and industrial loans increased approximately million between and primarily as the result of a single commercial loan totaling  which was classified as doubtful at december  the loan was subsequently charged off during the first quarter of  and a result the allowance allocation for that loan category declined during during  the company revised its methodology for allocating the total allowance for credit losses between the formula allowance and the specific allowance 
prior to  the entire loan portfolio was reviewed under the guidelines set by sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
in addition  those loans considered to be impaired were also reviewed under standards required by sfas no 
 and specific reserves were calculated under those guidelines 
for purposes of allocating the formula allowance and the specific allowance  loans identified as impaired under sfas no 
were allocated a formula reserve as calculated under sfas no 
 and an additional specific allowance if required under sfas no 
as a result  a portion of the allowance for impaired loans might be included in the formula allowance as calculated under sfas no 
 and the remainder would be designated a specific allowance  so that the entire allowance for impaired loans would be adequate under sfas no 
effective june  the company segregated those loans considered impaired under sfas no 
from the loan portfolio and analyzed the remainder of the loan portfolio under sfas no 
then loans considered impaired under sfas no 
were reviewed separately for specific allowance allocation 
as a result  all allowance reserves allocated to impaired loans are now considered specific reserves for purposes of the company s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  rather than a combination of formula allowance and specific allowance 
the following summarizes the company s allowance for credit losses related to the specific  formula  and unallocated reserves for the year ends shown amounts shown prior to have been adjusted to reflect the revised methodology for allocating the total allowance between the formula allowance and the specific allowance as discussed above december  dollars in s formula allowance specific allowance unallocated allowance total allowance at december   the company s allowance for credit losses was million  consisting of million in formula allowance  and million in specific allowance 
at december   the specific allowance consisted of  allocated to commercial and industrial loans  and million to lease financing loans 
at december   the company s allowance for credit losses was million  consisting of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated entirely to commercial and industrial loans  and the remaining  and  were allocated to real estate mortgage and lease financing loans  respectively 
the total formula allowance decreased approximately  between and  with decreases of  and  experienced in commercial and industrial loans and real estate mortgage loans 
during  the company experienced  a decrease of million in substandard loans  an increase of million in special mention loans  a decrease of  in doubtful loans  and a decrease of approximately million in pass loans 
the formula allowance increased in all loan categories except mortgage and installment loans during as the result of increases in loan balances during the year  as well as increases in the level of classified loans 
the formula allowance increased by approximately  between december  and december  the increase in the formula allowance during was the result of several factors including  an increase of million in substandard loans  an increase of  in doubtful loans  and an increase of approximately million in pass loans during special mention loans decreased by about  between december  and december  although in some instances  the downgrading of a loan resulting from the factors used by the company in its allowance analysis has been reflected in the formula allowance  management believes that in some instances  the impact of material events and trends has not yet been reflected in the level of nonperforming loans or the internal risk grading process regarding these loans 
accordingly  the company s evaluation of probable losses related to these factors may be reflected in the unallocated allowance 
the evaluation of the inherent losses concerning these factors involve a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits  and therefore the company does not spread the unallocated allowance among segments of the portfolio 
at december  the company had no unallocated allowance  reflecting a decrease from the balance of  at december   and  at december  management s estimates of the unallocated allowance are based upon a number of underlying factors including the effect of deteriorating national and local economic trends  the effects of export market conditions on certain agricultural and manufacturing borrowers  the effects of abnormal weather patterns on agricultural borrowers  as well as other borrowers that may be impacted by such conditions  the effect of increased competition in the company s market area and the resultant potential impact of more relaxed underwriting standards to borrowers with multi bank relationships  the effect of soft real estate markets  and the effects of having a larger number of borrowing relationships which are close to the company s lending limit  any one if which were not to perform to contractual terms  would have a material impact on the allowance 
the company s loan portfolio has concentrations in commercial real estate  commercial  and construction loans  however these portfolio percentages fall within the company s loan policy guidelines 
it is the company s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on loans for which reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectibility of interest or principal due to the inability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement 
such loans are placed on nonaccrual status whenever the payment of principal or interest is days past due or earlier when the conditions warrant  and interest collected is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
management may grant exceptions to this policy if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the company s nonperformong assets as of the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands  except footnote nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans  past due days or more  still accruing nonperforming loans to total gross loans nonperforming assets to total gross loans there are no nonaccrual loans at december  which are restructured 
included in nonaccrual loans at december  and and are restructured loans totaling  and  respectively 
the interest income that would have been earned on nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  in accordance with their original terms is approximately million 
the overall level of nonperforming assets has increased since  primarily as the result of a small number of large lending relationships  which have become nonperforming during that period 
during  three large relationships totaling approximately million were classified as nonaccrual  while approximately million in nonaccrual loans were transferred to other real estate owned through foreclosure 
during  million  representing one of the three large relationships that had become nonaccrual during the previous year  was foreclosed upon and transferred to other real estate owned through foreclosure 
in addition during  a nonperdorming lease portfolio totaling million was taken to nonaccrual status 
aside from the small number of large nonperforming relationships just discussed  the company does not foresee an overall increase in nonperforming assets as a result of the condition of the loan portfolio  and in fact nonperforming levels have begun to decline 
continued high levels of nonperforming assets have the potential to impact the future earnings growth of the company  however management believes that with declining nonperforming balances combined with prudent lending policies  the company will not experience any significant impact on earnings 
the overall level of nonaccrual loans has increased between december  and december  as commercial and commercial real estate delinquencies have increased 
a substantial portion of the nonaccural loans at december  are collateralized by real estate 
other real estate owned through foreclosure has been reduced significantly during as the result of both sales  and transfers of properties for other uses 
one property totaling more than million was sold during the first quarter of  while two additional properties totaling more than million were transferred to bank premises during the second quarter of one of these transferred properties with a carrying value of  was subsequently sold during the fourth quarter of the remaining transferred property will be used in the company s ongoing operations see note to the company s financial statements 
loans past due more than days are receiving increased management attention and are monitored for increased risk 
the company continues to move past due loans to nonaccrual status in its ongoing effort to recognize loan problems at an earlier point in time when they may be dealt with more effectively 
as impaired loans  nonaccrual and restructured loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly 
except for the loans included in the above table  there were no loans at december  where the known credit problems of a borrower caused the company to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which would result in such loan being included as a nonaccrual  past due or restructured loan at some future date 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality and allowance for credit losses section of this financial review 
if the loan portfolio were to increase by proportionally throughout all loan classifications  the additional estimated provision to the allowance that would be required  based on the percentage allocations utilized at december   would be approximately  pretax  net of tax 
this includes an additional   net of tax for criticized loans those classified as special mention or worse and excluding those considered impaired under sfas no 
 and an additional   net of tax for the remainder of the loan portfolio that is perfoming 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation expense is computed principally on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the expected useful lives of certain assets including technological related hardware and software could be subject to change due to technological advances or new standards among computer  or other related equipment 
such equipment generally has a short depreciable life  and therefore changes in the useful lives of such equipment would not have a material impact on the net income of the company 
other real estate owned real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at the lower of the book value of the loan  or fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell 
the excess  if any  of the loan amount over the fair value is charged to the allowance for credit losses 
subsequent declines in the fair value of other real estate owned  along with related revenue and expenses from operations  are charged to noninterest expense 
the valuation of such properties is subject to change as circumstances in the company s market area  or general economic trends  change 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are measured using current tax rates applied to such taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
if the company s future income is not sufficient to apply the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the deferred tax asset may not be realized and the company s income will be reduced 
on december  the california franchise tax board ftb announced certain tax transactions related to real estate investment trusts reits and regulated investment companies rics will be disallowed pursuant to senate bill and assembly bill  which were signed into law in the th quarter of as a result  the company reversed related net state tax benefits recorded in the first three quarters of and took no such benefit in the th quarter 
the company continues to review the information available from the ftb and its financial advisors and believe that the company s position has merit 
the company will pursue its tax claims and defend its use of these entities and transactions 
at this time  the company cannot predict what the ultimate outcome will be  however  management believes it is not probable that these benefits will be reversed for the year ended december  if the ftb were to prevail against the company in its defense of tax benefits taken during  the negative effect to net income would be approximately  stock based compensation for all years presented in the consolidated financial statements  the company accounted for stock options under the provisions apb no 
accordingly  no compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options is reflected in the income statements 
pro forma disclosures of the impact of compensation expense and related tax benefit associated with stock options are included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the pro forma amounts are calculated on the estimated fair value of the options at the date of the grant  based on assumptions made during the year of the grant 
those assumptions are outlined in note stock options in the company s notes to financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and investment securities 
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis 
note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains an explanation of the process for determining when the accrual of interest income is discontinued on impaired loans and under what circumstances loans are returned to an accruing status 
liquidity and asset liability management the primary function of asset liability management is to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity liquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on and off balance sheet financial obligations  including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals  without straining the company s equity structure 
to maintain an adequate liquidity position  the company relies on  in addition to cash and cash equivalents  cash inflows from deposits and short term borrowings  repayments of principal on loans and investments  and interest income received 
the company s principal cash outflows are for loan origination  purchases of investment securities  depositor withdrawals and payment of operating expenses 
other sources of liquidity not on the balance sheet at december  include unused collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit from other banks  the federal home loan bank  and from the federal reserve bank totaling million 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility the company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or the company may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the company maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk 
the policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements which comply with regulatory guidance the liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly basis to the board of directors 
the policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial market crisis 
in addition to lines of credit from other banks totaling million  the contingency plan includes steps that may be taken in the event the total liquidity ratio falls or is projected to fall below for any extended period of time 
the bank alco committee shall take steps to correct this condition using one or more of the following methods as needed investments near maturity may be sold to meet temporary funding needs but may need to be replaced to maintain liquidity ratios within acceptable limits 
unsecured fed funds lines with correspondents may be used to fund short term peaks in loan demand or deposit run off 
other off balance sheet funding sources such as credit lines at fhlb or the frb may be used for longer periods 
the bank will not rely on brokered money as a primary source of funds 
however  if may be prudent to utilize brokered deposits particularly at times when the interest costs are lower than could be obtained in the local market 
however  the sum of all brokered deposits will not exceed of the total deposits of the bank 
the bank may elect to operate a telemarketing money desk for the purpose of acquiring certificates of deposits from both the local market and national market 
the board of directors and management recognize that deposits acquired through money desk operations may be considered a higher cost and more volatile type of deposit than traditional bank deposits 
selling whole loans or participation in loans or by increasing the amounts sold in existing participation loans are additional means for increasing liquidity 
the state of california treasurer is a reliable source of deposits 
the bank can typically accept cd s from this source up to of equity as long as it has sufficient collateral pledged 
marketing for cd s within our marketplace is another means for raising funds or through programs that post our rates on their website  deposits from these sources should not exceed of the banks total deposits for extended periods beyond days without board approval 
should the bank become illiquid in spite of these steps  it will curtail its lending activities 
the first step in this process will be to curtail credit marketing and tighten pricing guidelines 
the second step will be to encourage loan payoffs on a selective basis where circumstances and loan documentation provide this opportunity 
only as a last resort will the bank totally curtail lending activities to credit worthy customers 
the company continues to emphasize liability management as part of its overall asset liability management strategy 
through the discretionary acquisition of short term borrowings  the company has been able to provide liquidity to fund asset growth while  at the same time  better utilizing its capital resources  and better controlling interest rate risk 
the borrowings are generally short term and more closely match the repricing characteristics of floating rate loans  which comprise approximately of the company s loan portfolio at december  this does not preclude the company from selling assets such as investment securities to fund liquidity needs but  with favorable borrowing rates  the company has maintained a positive yield spread between borrowed liabilities and the assets which those liabilities fund 
if  at some time  rate spreads become unfavorable  the company has the ability to utilize an asset management approach and  either control asset growth or  fund further growth with maturities or sales of investment securities 
the company s liquid asset base which generally consists of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos and investment securities  is maintained at a level deemed sufficient to provide the cash outlay necessary to fund loan growth as well as any customer deposit runoff that may occur 
within this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets 
this is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans  which historically have represented the company s highest yielding asset 
at december   the bank had of total assets in the loan portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio of 
liquid assets at december  include cash and cash equivalents totaling million as compared to million at december  liabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non core deposits as well as short term borrowings 
core deposits  which comprise approximately of total deposits at december   provide a significant and stable funding source for the company 
at december   unused lines of credit with the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank totaling million are collateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the carrying value of loans pledged on these unused borrowing lines totaled million at december  for further discussion of the company s borrowing lines  see short term borrowings included in previously in the financial condition section of this financial review

regulatory matters capital adequacy capital adequacy for bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks has become increasingly important in recent years 
continued deregulation of the banking industry since the s has resulted in  among other things  a broadening of business activities allowed beyond that of traditional banking products and services 
because of this volatility within the banking and financial services industry  regulatory agencies have increased their focus upon ensuring that banking institutions meet certain capital requirements as a means of protecting depositors and investors against such volatility 
during july  the company completed an offering of trust preferred securities in an aggregate amount of million to enhance its regulatory base  while providing additional liquidity 
subsequent to the completion of the offering  the company contributed million of that offering to the bank to enhance its capital position 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital up to a maximum of of tier capital 
any additional portion will qualify as tier capital 
as shareholders equity increases  the amount of tier capital that can be comprised of trust preferred securities will increase 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system board of governors has adopted regulations requiring insured institutions to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus intangible assets  identified losses and investments in certain subsidiaries  plus unrealized losses or minus unrealized gains on available for sale securities to total assets 
institutions which have received the highest composite regulatory rating and which are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier capital to total assets 
to be considered well capitalized  the institution must maintain a leverage capital ratio of 
all other institutions are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum requirements 
the board of governors has also adopted a statement of policy  supplementing its leverage capital ratio requirements  which provides definitions of qualifying total capital consisting of tier capital and tier supplementary capital  including the allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and sets forth minimum risk based capital ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
the most highly rated insured institutions are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
to be considered well capitalized  institutions must maintain a ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
the following table sets forth the company s and the bank s actual capital positions at december  and the regulatory minimums for the company and the bank to be well capitalized under the guidelines discussed above company bank regulatory minimums well capitalized actual capital ratios actual capital ratios total risk based capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio under federal reserve guidelines  the company and the bank are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of  tier capital to risk weighted assets of  and a leverage ratio of  to be considered well capitalized 
as is indicated by the above table  the company and the bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital guidelines at december  management believes that  under the current regulations  both will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
dividends dividends paid to shareholders by the company are subject to restrictions set forth in the california general corporation law 
the california general corporation law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout are at least equal the amount of the proposed distribution 
the primary source of funds with which dividends will be paid to shareholders will come from cash dividends received by the company from the bank 
during the year ended december   the company received million in cash dividends from the bank  from which the company declared million in dividends to shareholders 
the bank as a state chartered bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth in california state banking law  and administered by the california commissioner of financial institutions commissioner 
under such restrictions  the bank may not pay cash dividends in an amount which exceeds the lesser of the retained earnings of the bank or the bank s net income for the last three fiscal years less the amount of distributions to shareholders during that period of time 
if the above test is not met  cash dividends may only be paid with the prior approval of the commissioner  in an amount not exceeding the bank s net income for its last fiscal year or the amount of its net income for the current fiscal year 
such restrictions do not apply to stock dividends  which generally require neither the satisfaction of any tests nor the approval of the commissioner 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if the commissioner finds that the shareholders equity is not adequate or that the declarations of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound  the commissioner may order the state bank not to pay any dividend 
the frb may also limit dividends paid by the bank 
this is not the case with the bank 
year to date dividends of million and million paid to shareholders and the company  respectively  through december  were well within the maximum allowed under those regulatory guidelines  without approval of the commissioner

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and market risk an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or is subject to interest rate adjustments as market rates of interest change 
interest rate sensitivity is the measure of the volatility of earnings from movements in market rates of interest  which is generally reflected in interest rate spread 
as interest rates change in the market place  yields earned on assets do not necessarily move in tandem with interest rates paid on liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is related to liquidity in that each is affected by maturing assets and sources of funds 
interest rate sensitivity is also affected by assets and liabilities with interest rates that are subject to change prior to maturity 
the object of interest rate sensitivity management is to minimize the impact on earnings from interest rate changes in the marketplace 
in recent years  deregulation  causing liabilities to become more interest rate sensitive  combined with interest rate volatility in the capital markets  has placed additional emphasis on this principal 
when management decides to maintain repricing imbalances  it usually does so on the basis of a well conceived strategy designed to ensure that the risk is not excessive and that liquidity is properly maintained 
the company s interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability management committee alco which reports to the board of directors on a periodic basis  pursuant to established operating policies and procedures 
as part of its overall risk management  the company pursues various asset and liability management strategies  which may include obtaining derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest fluctuations on the company s net interest margin 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the purpose of minimizing interest rate fluctuations on its interest rate margin and equity 
under the interest rate swap agreement  the company receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate based on the prime rate prime 
the swap qualifies as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and is designated as a hedge of the variability of cash flows the company receives from certain variable rate loans indexed to prime 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the swap agreement is measured at fair value and reported as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swap that is deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest income when such cash flow occurs in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedge is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income as part of noninterest income 
the amortizing hedge has a remaining notional value of million and a duration of approximately years 
as of december   the maximum length of time over which the company is hedging its exposure to the variability of future cash flows is approximately four and one half years 
as of december   the loss amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income associated with these cash flows totaled  net of tax benefit of 
during the year ended december    was reclassified from other accumulated comprehensive income into earnings 
interest rate risk can be measured through various methods including gap  duration and market value analysis as well as income simulation models  which provides a dynamic view of interest rate sensitivity based on the assumptions of the company s management 
the company employs each of these methods and refines these processes to make the most accurate measurements possible 
the information provided by these calculations is the basis for management decisions in managing interest rate risk 
from the gap report below  the company is apparently subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its liabilities have the potential to reprice more quickly than its assets within the next year 
at december   the company had a cumulative month gap of million or of total earning assets 
management believes the gap analysis shown below is not entirely indicative of the company s actual interest rate sensitivity  because certain interest sensitive liabilities would not reprice to the same degree as interest sensitive assets 
for example  if the prime rate were to change by basis points  the floating rate loans included in the million immediately adjustable category would change by the full basis points 
interest bearing checking and savings accounts which are also included in the immediately adjustable column probably would move only a portion of the basis point rate change and  in fact  might not even move at all 
in addition  many of the floating rate time deposits are at their floors  or have repricing rates below their current floors  which means that they might act as fixed rate instruments in either a rising or a declining rate environment although there are only about million of these floating rate time deposits at december  
the effects of market value risk have been mitigated to some degree by the makeup of the bank s balance sheet 
loans are generally short term or are floating rate instruments 
at december   million or of the loan portfolio matures or reprices within one year  and only of the portfolio matures or reprices in more than years 
total investment securities including call options and prepayment assumptions  have a combined duration of approximately years 
nearly million or of interest bearing liabilities mature or can be repriced within the next months  even though the rate elasticity of deposits with no defined maturities may not necessarily be the same as interest earning assets 
the following table sets forth the company s gap  or estimated interest rate sensitivity profile based on ending balances as of december   representing the interval of time before earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may respond to changes in market rates of interest 
assets and liabilities are categorized by remaining interest rate maturities rather than by principal maturities of obligations

see above for discussion of the impact of floating rate cd s 
the company utilizes a vendor purchased simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on both a and basis point rise and a and basis point fall in interest rates ramped over a twelve month period  with net interest impacts projected out as far as twenty four months 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment of certain assets and liabilities 
projected net interest income is calculated assuming customers will reinvest maturing deposit accounts and the company will originate new loans 
the balance sheet growth assumptions utilized correspond closely to the company s strategic growth plans and annual budget 
excess cash is invested in overnight funds or other short term investments such as us treasuries 
cash shortfalls are covered through additional borrowing of overnight or short term funds 
the board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum decreases in net interest income of and in the event of a bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates over a twelve month period 
based on the information and assumptions utilized in the simulation model at december   the resultant projected impact on net interest income falls within policy limits set by the board of directors for all rate scenarios simulated 
the company also utilizes the same vendor purchased simulation model to project the impact of changes in interest rates on the underlying market value of all the company s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet accounts under alternative interest rate scenarios 
the resultant net value  as impacted under each projected interest rate scenario  is referred to as the market value of equity mv of equity 
this technique captures the interest rate risk of the company s business mix across all maturities 
the market analysis is performed using an immediate rate shock of basis points up and down calculating the present value of expected cash flows under each rate environment at applicable discount rates 
the market value of loans is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows over either the term to maturity for fixed rate loans or scheduled repricing for floating rate loans using the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings 
the market value of investment securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from reliable independent brokers 
the market value of time deposits is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows using current rates for similar instruments of comparable maturities 
the market value of deposits with no defined maturites  including interest bearing checking  money market and savings accounts is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows at a rate equal to the difference between the cost of these deposits and the alternate use of the funds  federal funds in this case 
assumed maturities for these deposits are estimated using decay analysis and are generally assumed to have implied maturities of less than five years 
for noninterest sensitive assets and liabilities  the market value is equal to their carrying value amounts at the reporting date 
the company s interest rate risk policy establishes maximum decreases in the company s market value of equity of and in the event of an immediate and sustained bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates 
as shown in the table below  the percentage changes in the net market value of the company s equity are within policy limits for both rising and falling rate scenarios 
the following sets forth the analysis of the company s market value risk inherent in its interest sensitive financial instruments as they relate to the entire balance sheet at december  and december  in thousands 
fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with absolute precision 
assumptions have been made as to the appropriate discount rates  prepayment speeds  expected cash flows and other variables 
changes in these assumptions significantly affect the estimates and as such  the obtained fair value may not be indicative of the value negotiated in the actual sale or liquidation of such financial instruments  nor comparable to that reported by other financial institutions 
in addition  fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate future business
