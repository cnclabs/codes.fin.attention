overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products for use to diagnose and treat gastrointestinal disorders 
our development strategy has been to acquire late stage drug candidates with short time lines to commercialization 
we currently market and sell two pharmaceutical products  visicol and ib stat 
we are also studying visicol for the treatment of constipation and for use prior to certain pre operative gastrointestinal  gynecological and urological surgical procedures 
in addition to our marketed products  we are studying inkp as a new generation purgative product and colirest for the treatment of patients with ibd 
the following table outlines our current product pipeline from which we have focused the majority of our research  development  marketing and sales efforts since inception and also sets forth the current development status of our products and product candidates in each targeted therapeutic indication product therapeutic indications development status visicol colon cleansing prior to fda approved  marketed product colonoscopy constipation post marketing study completed phase iv on going pre operative colonic surgical phase iv will commence during the procedures first half of inkp colon cleansing prior to colonoscopy phase ii will commence during the next generation purgative first half of ib stat symptoms associated with ibs marketed product reduction of bowel motility during certain diagnostic procedures colirest crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis  phase ii crohn s disease complete collectively inflammatory bowel phase ii ulcerative colitis complete disease ibd phase iib crohn s disease on going in september  we received notification that our flagship product  visicol  was approved for marketing as a preparation for colonoscopy 
following this notification  we immediately commenced marketing and sales efforts and in january  we began shipping visicol to our customers 
during  gastroenterologists reported the visualization mcc in some patients receiving visicol tablets 
mcc is a commonly used  inert  but highly insoluble substance that binds and fills visicol tablets 
the presence of mcc may lengthen the colonoscopy procedure and therefore deterred some gastroenterologists from prescribing visicol 
as a result revenues were adversely affected 
we adopted three strategies for overcoming the issue of mcc visualization during colonoscopy 
first  in october  we conducted a phase iv clinical study  which showed that visicol s efficacy at a reduced dosing regimen and less tablets and clear liquid volume was comparable to the labeled dose  with significantly reduced mcc visualization 
secondly  in march  the fda approved a supplemental new drug application snda  for a new formulation of visicol containing approximately less mcc 
in may  we began shipping this new formulation to customers  and since that time  we have become the fastest growing bowel preparation for use in patients undergoing colonoscopy 
lastly  during we developed and filed a provisional patent application with the us patent and trademark office for an mcc free new generation purgative tablet inkp 
revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of visicol in the united states 
we do not anticipate any material revenue in the near term from sales outside of the united states 
our revenues in any period are primarily a function of the number of visicol tablets prescribed 
at this time  visicol is prescribed as a bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy 
colonoscopy in many cases is an elective procedure  used to screen the inner lining of the colon for cancerous polyps 
there has historically been a seasonal trend in the us market based on holiday schedules and vacation patterns 
our sales may fluctuate on a quarterly basis based on such seasonal fluctuations 
our revenues are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to influence physician prescribing habits  manage purchasing practices of our customers  which include wholesalers and large retail chains  train  equip and manage our sales professionals  deliver our marketing message to target demographics  and introduce visicol s use for new indications 
expenses our expenses are primarily related to costs of goods sold  research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative 
our cost of goods sold consists of the costs to procure raw materials  manufacture pharmaceutical agents and package drug into commercial quantities 
in addition to product costs  our cost of goods sold also includes royalties on in licensed products and expenses to operate our distribution center 
research and development costs primarily include costs to study future drug candidates and product enhancements  run clinical trials  monitor drug safety  maintain compliance with regulatory authorities  and develop manufacturing techniques 
sales and marketing costs include the costs to train  manage and operate our gastrointestinal sales force along with developing marketing messages and campaigns to targeted physicians  patients and organizations to increase awareness of our products and their related indications 
general and administrative expenses include overhead costs associated with running a publicly traded specialty pharmaceutical company with commercial products and research initiatives  including but not limited to insurance costs  legal fees  accounting fees  and investor relations costs 
critical accounting policies and practices in cautionary advice regarding disclosures about critical accounting policies sec release no  december   the sec advised companies to provide more information about a company s most critical accounting policies  ie  the specific accounting policies that have the most impact on a company s results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
we have identified the following accounting policies that may constitute critical accounting policies  under the guidance provided by the release 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of visicol is recognized when  pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  all four of the following criteria are met i we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed and determinable  iii title has passed and iv collection is reasonably assured 
product demand from our customers during a given period may not correlate with prescription demand for the product in that period 
as a result  we periodically evaluate inventory positions in the distribution channel 
if we believe these levels are too high based on prescription demand  we may not accept purchase orders from or may not ship additional product to our customers until these levels are reduced 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
we establish these revenue reductions as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience  adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
for ib stat  we recognize revenue based on prescription data  net of estimated cash discounts 
this practice will continue until such time data becomes available that indicates that the product has achieved adequate market acceptance and future product returns can be reasonably estimated 
stock based compensation it is our policy  which is consistent with most public company policies  to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for our stock option plans rather than statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
had we applied sfas no 
 our net loss for each of the years ended december   and would have been greater 
product returns it is our policy to estimate and record an allowance for future product returns in connection with our sales of visicol 
we have applied a return rate to our unit sales to provide this allowance under our product return policy 
this return rate is calculated based on actual return experience and our monitoring of distribution channels taking into account the expiration dating of visicol 
the product return rate is periodically updated to reflect actual experience and changes to other factors affecting future product returns 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax asset items are deductible 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss nol and research and experimentation credit carryforwards available to be used in any given year upon the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
generally  a change in ownership of a company of greater than within a three year period results in an annual limitation on that company s ability to utilize its nol carryforwards and tax credits from the tax periods prior to the ownership change 
the rules providing for the definition of an ownership change are complex and we must perform a study to determine if we have undergone a change in ownership 
we believe that we have undergone an ownership change and are subject to an annual limitation on the use of our nol carryforwards pursuant to these provisions 
at december   we have concluded that a full valuation allowance is necessary for deferred tax assets given that we have only been profitable for two quarters 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we incurred losses of  or per share and  or per share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
losses during the year ended december  were largely the result of charges arising from the conversion of our previously outstanding june convertible notes

prescription levels for our lead product  visicol  continue to increase  resulting in increased orders from wholesalers and large retail chains 
visicol prescriptions were approximately  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  we believe the increased prescription levels have been fueled by increased market awareness and acceptance of visicol 
our gross profit was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross profit for product revenue was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period a year ago 
increases in gross profit and gross profit as a percent of sales for product revenue were the result of increased order volume  increased sales price per unit  decreased manufacturing and packaging costs per unit  and decreased distribution costs for visicol

distribution cost included expenses related to warehousing  tracking and shipping of product to our customers 
royalty cost represented amounts due to the inventor of visicol based on product sales 
we incurred research and development expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant reductions were the result of lower development costs associated with visicol  the internalization of the management of the ongoing colirest clinical trial  partially offset by development costs associated with our next generation purgative  for which we intend to initiate clinical studies in during  we spent approximately   and  on visicol  inkp and colirest  respectively  compared to  and  on visicol and colirest  respectively  during we also spent approximately  and  during and  respectively  related to payroll and other indirect costs related to our research and development initiatives 
sales and marketing costs of  and  were incurred for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  sales and marketing costs included expenses associated with our sales force  which consisted of sales representatives and four district managers at december   along with marketing campaigns related to visicol

general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was the result of increased overhead costs associated with supporting our growing sales volume  head count and market capitalization 
the  decrease in interest income was the result of decreased average cash and investment balances and decreased interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the same period a year ago 
the  decrease in interest and other expense was the result of the conversion our convertible notes in june along with decreased average borrowings and interest rates on our line of credit

we incurred research and development expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the significant reductions were the result of less development costs associated with the new visicol formulation and the internalization of the management of the ongoing colirest clinical trial 
sales and marketing costs of  and  were incurred for the years ended december  and  respectively

these charges included the acceleration of a redemption premium  deferred warrant cost  beneficial conversion amortization and deferred financing fees associated with these notes 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  the cash and cash equivalents balance at december  included net proceeds from warrant and option exercises of  we believe that our financial resources are adequate for our operations for at least the next months and  if we meet our sales objectives  we do not anticipate requiring additional capital to fund our operations 
however  we are seeking additional capital to fund possible acquisition or in licensing of additional products  the possible acquisition of businesses related to gastrointestinal pharmaceuticals  marketing and  if necessary  continued development of acquired products  the development and commercialization of new indications for visicol  research and development related to enhancements of existing products  and general corporate purposes  including working capital 
our line of credit is due to expire in march while it is our intention to renew the credit facility for an additional one year term  we believe our current cash balance along with our cash flows from operations are adequate to fund our operations in the event that the line of credit were not renewed in march our future short and long term capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including continued marketplace acceptance of our products 
to achieve operating profits  we  alone or with others  must successfully market and sell our products 
in addition to continued marketplace acceptance of our products  other factors which cannot be quantified and many of which we cannot control will also impact our short and long term capital requirements  including continued commercial costs of visicol  continued progress in our research and development activities  progress with pre clinical studies and clinical trials  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  technological and market developments  the ability to establish product development arrangements  the cost of manufacturing development  effective marketing activities and arrangements  and licensing or acquisition activity 
we are currently developing a new generation purgative inkp for cleansing the colon prior to colonoscopy  conducting a clinical trial of colirest in crohn s disease  continuing to study the use of visicol for constipation  commencing a study for the use of visicol in pre operative colonic surgical procedures  and continuing to market and sell visicol and ib stat to distributors and drug store chains 
during  we expect to spend up to  on inkp   on the visicol studies and visicol product development   on the colirest study  and  on visicol sales and marketing costs 
these activities will be funded by our current cash balance and future product sales 
if product sales fall short of current expectations or other factors negatively impact our cash balance  we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners  and from other sources 
no assurance can be given that necessary additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if adequate additional funds are not available when required  we may have to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research  drug discovery or development activities or certain other aspects of our operations and our business will be materially and adversely affected 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with lease obligations and manufacturing supply agreements contractual commitments total year years years years leased office space    manufacturing supply agreement   total contractual commitments    this table does not include any milestone payments under agreements we have entered into in relation to our licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
also  minimum annual expenditures pursuant to our technology license agreements have been excluded from this table as we expect to spend those amounts as we progress the development of the underlying technologies 
in the aggregate these minimum annual expenditures are approximately  and typically apply to all years prior to regulatory approval of a product incorporating the licensed technology 
in november  we entered into a five year operating lease agreement for office space for our corporate headquarters  and in april  we entered into a two year operating lease for warehouse space for our distribution center  which has been extended for an additional annual term 
the above table includes minimum lease payments remaining in connection with these lease agreements 
included are direct costs associated with our agreement with a contract manufacturing organization in connection with the commercial production of visicol tablets 
research and development programs during  we had three significant research and development projects relating to i visicol ii inkp and iii colirest 
visicol 
we have focused our visicol research and development on cleansing of the colon prior to colonoscopy and are presently marketing visicol for that indication 
in addition  we are also developing visicol for cleansing the colon prior to pre operative colonic surgical procedures and for treating constipation 
the current status of these projects are as follows i for cleansing of colon prior to colonoscopy  the fda has approved both our nda as well as our snda  ii for cleansing the colon prior to pre operative colonic surgical procedures  we intend to commence a phase iv study during the first half of  iii for treating constipation  we have completed a post marketing study and have commenced a phase iv study that we intend to complete during the first half of as of december   we have incurred total costs of approximately  in connection with our visicol research and development 
during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred an aggregate of  in research and development expenses  approximately  of which was attributable to visicol 
inkp during  we developed a next generation purgative for cleansing the colon prior to colonoscopy 
clinical batches of this new product have been manufactured and formulated to yield smaller tablets that may be easier to ingest 
additionally  the new product does not contain any mcc  which is a common inert  but highly insoluble substance 
we intend to conduct clinical studies and apply for fda approval of this new product using alternative dosing regimens that utilize fewer tablets and allow for single day administration 
we intend to complete a phase ii study and commence a phase iii study during as of december   we have incurred total costs of approximately  in connection with our inkp research and development 
during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred an aggregate of  in research and development expenses  approximately  of which was attributable to inkp colirest 
we are developing colirest for treatment of ibd and have completed a phase ii study of crohn s disease and a phase ii study of ulcerative colitis 
in june  we began a colirest clinical phase iib study of crohn s disease 
we anticipate an interim analysis by late as of december   we have incurred total costs of approximately  in connection with the development of colirest and related compounds 
during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred an aggregate of  in research and development expenses  approximately  of which was attributable to colirest 
indirect costs 
in addition to the direct costs related to the development of our technologies  we incurred indirect non technology specific overhead costs 
these expenses include the salaries and administrative costs of managing our research and development projects  which for the year ended december  equaled approximately  recently issued accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial standard no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our line of credit and certain investments 
we do not manage the risk of fluctuations in interest rates associated with the line of credit  as it is a short term borrowing with a maturity date in the interest rate on our line of credit has fluctuated from to over the past year and we had no balance outstanding on our line of credit at december  typically  a substantial portion of our assets are investment grade debt instruments such as direct obligations of the us treasury  securities of federal agencies which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the us government and bank certificates of deposit 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument is expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future  to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
we do not anticipate any material changes in our primary market risk exposure in we do not hold or issue any derivatives
