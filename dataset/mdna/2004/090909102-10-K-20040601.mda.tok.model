item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information about our foreign operations 
in addition  selected financial data by geographic area is available in note to the consolidated financial statements included in 
table of contents this annual report on form k 
we are required to obtain export licenses for some system sales to certain foreign countries 
we also purchase components from third party sources in other countries 
customer training  support and maintenance in connection with the purchase of a system  our independent domestic dealers sales representatives or our own field support representative if the sale is made by our direct sales force  will typically train the customer s medical and office personnel in the use of the equipment  assist in the introduction of the data into the system and provide assistance to the customer during the initial period of operation 
phone based support is provided hours a day by a dedicated group of clinical and information systems specialists 
foreign sales are supported by the company s foreign distributors who are provided periodic training and support 
our practice is to offer a one year limited warranty at no additional charge on our software and equipment for parts and labor 
we have experienced satisfactory field operating results  and warranty expense has been insignificant to date 
the manufacturers of the computers used in our systems provide a one year warranty against defects and have service capabilities throughout the united states 
in addition  we offer our customers service and extended maintenance agreements for an additional fee  to date  these fees have been minimal 
we also sell version upgrades to our software to existing customers for a minimal fee 
assembly  system hardware and sources of supply we assemble our systems by integrating computers  monitors  printers and certain standard components produced by other manufacturers  with peripherals and other hardware  including circuit boards  and certain electronic components that we have manufactured and software packages that we have developed 
our systems include pcs  printers and mass storage media such as high capacity hard disks and removable dvd disks for the storage of both operating programs and data 
we purchase computers from distributors of such products for varying discounts depending upon the volume of equipment purchased 
the components used in our systems are available from a number of suppliers 
we perform quality control and testing procedures on all systems prior to delivery 
patents and trademarks we currently own eight patents protecting certain aspects of our proprietary product systems and disposable hearing products 
we continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio and have applied for nine additional patents currently under review by the us patent and trademark office 
there can be no assurance that these patents will afford any commercial benefits 
our trademarks include bio logic  audx  abaer  m 
a

e 
r  ear muffin  stacked abr  ceegraph  sleepscan  treetip  scout  navigator  brain atlas and traveler 
we also have developed a number of unpublished computer software programs that are entitled to unpublished copyright privileges as confidential proprietary material 
we believe that  in the age of rapidly changing technology  our continued success is primarily dependent upon the technical competence and creative skill of our personnel  rather than on patents  copyrights or other proprietary rights 
competition we compete with a number of entities offering systems that perform similar diagnostic tests 
some of our principal competitors in the neurology and sleep monitoring business are substantially larger and have more marketing personnel and greater technical resources than we they include nicolet instrument corporation a unit of viasys corporation  exceltech  nihon kohden corporation  grass telefactor a subsidiary of astro med corporation  oxford instruments  mallinckrodt  inc a subsidiary of tyco  and caldwell laboratories  inc in the hearing area  our principal competitors include natus medical  inc  gsi a division of nicolet instrumentation corp  a unit of viasys corporation and madsen electronics 
we believe our competitive 
table of contents strength lies in the range and quality of our software and hardware  the breadth and quality of our disposable products offering  and the cost effectiveness of our integrated systems 
another major competitive advantage is our ability to tailor systems to a customer s particular diagnostic and data processing requirements 
government regulation our products are generally subject to government regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda and accordingly  unless determined to be exempt  are subject to the fda s premarket k clearance procedures 
under fda regulations  a medical device is classified as either a class i device  which is subject only to general control provisions  a class ii device which  in addition to applicable general controls  will be made subject to future performance standards developed by the fda  or a class iii device which  in addition to applicable general controls  is subject to fda premarket approval 
our systems have been classified as class ii medical devices as such term is defined in the regulations promulgated by the fda 
we have filed the appropriate k applications notifications of intent to market with the fda  and continue to advise the fda as modifications and additions are made to our systems 
in addition  all manufacturers of medical devices are required to register with the fda and to adhere to certain good manufacturing practices and good laboratory practices  which prescribe recordkeeping procedures and provide for the inspection of facilities 
backlog our backlog is generally all related to our manufactured systems 
production time varies from a few days to a few weeks  depending on the complexity of the system 
systems backlog was million at april   compared to million on april  employees as of february   we had full time employees 
our business is dependent in part upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union and we believe our employee relations are satisfactory

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and other factors described below because they could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects and could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
also  you should be aware that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not yet know of  or that we currently think are immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
you should also refer to the other information contained in and incorporated by reference into this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and the related notes 
risks related to our business we face aggressive competition in many areas of our business  and our business will be harmed if we fail to compete effectively 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous companies in many areas of our business 
although we believe that our products currently compete favorably  we cannot give assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against our current and potential competitors 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have  and we may not be able to compete effectively with them 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products 
we anticipate that we may have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of our product lines 
demand for some of our products depends on the capital spending policies of our customers 
changes in these policies could negatively affect our business 
a majority of our customers are hospitals  physician offices and clinics 
many factors  including public policy spending provisions  available resources and economic cycles have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities 
these factors can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations and sales to high volume purchasers may reduce our average selling prices  which could reduce our revenue and gross profits from these sales 
we have entered  and may in the future enter  into agreements with customers who purchase high volumes of our products 
our agreements with these customers may contain discounts off of our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations  which could cause our revenue and profit margins to decline 
in addition  we have entered into agreements to sell our products to members of group purchasing organizations  which negotiate volume purchase prices for medical devices and supplies for member hospitals  group practices and other clinics 
while we make sales directly to group purchasing organization members  the members of these organizations now receive volume discounts off our normal selling price and may receive other special pricing considerations from us from time to time 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations may conflict with our direct sales efforts to our existing customers 
if we enter into agreements with new group purchasing organizations and some of our existing customers begin purchasing our products through those group purchasing organizations  our revenue and profit margins could decline 

table of contents the complexity presented by international operations could negatively affect our business 
international revenues account for a material portion of our revenues 
international revenues excluding canada from continuing operations  accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal and of our total revenues in fiscal while we plan to continue expanding our presence in international markets  our international operations present a number of risks  including the following foreign laws may limit our ability to properly maintain our distribution channels 
for example  a number of foreign laws restrict our ability to terminate a distributor for taking actions that adversely affect our business  such as manufacturing and selling competing products 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have  on occasion  forced us to lower our prices  thereby reducing our margins for some of our products 
if we fail to obtain and maintain necessary foreign regulatory approvals in order to market and sell our products outside of the us  we may not be able to sell our products in other countries 
because we rely on distributors to sell our products outside of the us  our revenues could decline if our existing distributors reduce the volume of purchases from us  or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated 
other risks that could affect our international business include the impact of possible recessions in economies outside the us political and economic instability  including instability related to war and terrorist attacks in the us and abroad 
dependence of demand for our products on health care spending by foreign governments 
greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods 
reduced acceptance of our products and systems due to language translation concerns 
reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and potentially conflicting intellectual property rights of third parties under the laws of various foreign jurisdictions 
a strengthening of the dollar that could make our products less competitive in foreign markets  because our sales contracts call for payment in us dollars 
our business could be harmed if our competitors establish cooperative relationships with large medical device vendors or rapidly acquire market share through industry consolidation 
we expect that the medical device industry will continue to consolidate 
large medical device vendors may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors  or new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  either of which would harm our business and financial prospects 
our financial results could be negatively impacted by an unfavorable settlement of an outstanding medical insurance claim 
we have a self funded medical plan with stop loss insurance for our employees 
we currently carry a  receivable on our balance sheet related to a claim incurred by one of the plan s participants 
we have paid the medical providers  and they are currently in the process of seeking reimbursement from medicare 
the amount not paid by medicare would then be collected from our stop loss insurance carrier 
it is possible that we will be reimbursed for the full amount of this receivable 
however  if we subsequently determine that the carrying value of this asset needs to be reduced or written off completely  this will have a material unfavorable impact on future operating results 

table of contents our dependence on suppliers for materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products 
we contract with third parties for the supply of some of the components used in our products and in the production of our disposable products 
the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy and unpredictable 
some of these suppliers are not obligated to continue to supply us 
for certain of these materials and components  relatively few alternative sources of supply exist 
we may not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period  or on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  which could impair our ability to produce and supply our products 
additionally  replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to regulatory requirements and other factors applicable to our manufacturing operations 
incorporation of components from a new supplier into our products may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume product sales 
this process may take a substantial period of time  and we cannot be assured that we would be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance or approval 
this could create supply disruptions that would harm our product sales and operating results 
finally  an uncorrected defect or supplier s variation in a component or raw material  either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process  could harm our ability to manufacture the affected product 
our ability to market and sell our products depends upon receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approval of our products and manufacturing operations 
our failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals and compliance could negatively affect our business 
our products and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the fda and by similar regulatory agencies in many other countries in which we do business 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we seek to market in the us must first receive k premarket clearance pursuant to section k of the food  drug  and cosmetics act of  as amended 
the principal risks that we face in obtaining and maintaining the regulatory approvals necessary to market our products include the approval process for medical devices in the united states and abroad can be lengthy and expensive 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes one to three years  but can take even longer 
we cannot assure you that the fda will ever grant either k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
as a result  we may expend substantial resources in developing and testing a new product but fail to obtain the necessary approvals or clearances to market or manufacture the product on a timely basis  if at all 
furthermore  if the fda concludes that these future products using our technology do not meet the requirements to obtain k clearance  we would have to seek premarket approval 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not impose the more burdensome premarket approval requirement on modifications to our existing products or future products  which in either case could be costly and cause us to divert our attention and resources from our business 
when we modify a medical device for which we have received marketing approval  we must determine whether the modification requires us to seek new regulatory approvals 
if the fda or other regulatory agency does not agree with our determination  we may be prohibited from marketing the modified device until we receive the requisite regulatory approval or clearance 
in addition  the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of devices for uses that have not been cleared or approved by the fda 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could be subject to a number of enforcement actions  including warning letters  fines  product seizures  recalls  injunctions  total or partial suspension of production  operating restrictions or limitations on marketing  refusal of the government to grant new clearances or approvals  withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals and civil and criminal penalties 

table of contents other regulating legislation other than fda to which our business is subject to includes the evironmental protection act  the occupational safety and health act  and state and local counterparts to these acts 
our operating results could suffer if future changes in technology or market conditions result in adjustments to our recorded asset balance for intangible assets 
we currently carry approximately million of intangible assets on our books  the most significant of which relates to internally developed software development costs 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
due to the highly competitive nature of the medical device industry  new technologies could impair the value of our intangible assets if they create market conditions over which we have no control where our products are no longer competitive 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights and  as a result  we could lose competitive advantages that could adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends  in part  on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain  assert and defend patent rights  protect trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
we currently own or have rights to eight us patents 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to obtain additional licenses to patents of others or that we will be able to develop additional patentable technology of our own  any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or that the patents or proprietary rights of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business  others will not independently develop similar products  others will not design around or infringe such patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to us  and any patent obtained or licensed by us will be held to be valid and enforceable if challenged by another party 
although we endeavor to protect our patent rights from infringement  we may not be aware  or become aware  of patents issued to our competitors or others that conflict with our own 
such conflicts could result in a rejection of important patent applications or the invalidation of important patents  which could have a materially adverse effect on our competitive position 
in the event of such conflicts  or in the event we believe that competitive products infringe patents to which we hold rights  we may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against  or may be required to defend against such litigation or proceedings involving  holders of such conflicting patents or competing products 
such litigation or proceedings may have a materially adverse effect on our competitive position  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation or proceeding 
litigation and other proceedings relating to patent matters  whether initiated by us or a third party  can be expensive and time consuming  regardless of whether the outcome is favorable to us  and can result in the diversion of substantial financial  managerial and other resources 
an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties or require us to cease any related development or commercialization activities 
in addition  if patents that contain dominating or conflicting claims have been or are subsequently issued to others and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid  we may be required to obtain licenses under patents or other proprietary rights of others 
any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights may not be made available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we could encounter delays or could find that the development  manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed 
we rely on proprietary know how and confidential information and employ various methods  such as entering into confidentiality and non compete agreements with our current employees and with certain third parties to whom we have divulged proprietary information  to protect the processes  concepts  ideas and documentation associated with our technologies 
such methods may not afford significant protection to us  and may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets  or to ensure that other companies would not acquire information that we consider proprietary 

table of contents our operating results may decline if we do not succeed in developing  acquiring and marketing additional products or improving our existing products 
the development and acquisition of additional products and technologies  and the improvement of our existing products requires significant investments in research and development 
if we fail to successfully sell new products and update our existing products  our operating results may decline as our existing products reach the end of their commercial life cycles 
our business is likely to be adversely affected if we are unable to retain our senior executive officers and key business and technical personnel 
we are dependent upon the services of our senior executives  in particular gabriel raviv  our chief executive officer  and other key business and technical personnel 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on our senior executives 
the loss of the services of mr 
raviv or any other senior executive or key employee could have a material adverse effect on us 
also  our continued commercialization will depend upon  among other things  the successful recruiting and retention of highly skilled managerial and marketing personnel with experience in business activities such as ours 
competition for the type of highly skilled individuals sought by us is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing key employees or that we will be able to find  attract and retain skilled personnel on acceptable terms 
if we breach any of the agreements under which we license commercialization rights to products or technology from others  we could lose licenses that are important to our business 
we license rights to products and technology that are important to our business and we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future 
under these licenses  we are subject to commercialization and development  sublicensing  royalty  insurance and other obligations 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements  or otherwise breach a license agreement  the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in whole or to terminate the exclusive nature of the license 
in addition  upon the termination of the license  we may be required to license to the licensor any related intellectual property that we develop 
we may be unable to successfully develop and or commercialize our new and existing products 
the successful development and commercialization of new products will depend upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals 
if we are unable to obtain these approvals  we will be unable to market and sell our products  which will negatively affect our business 
even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our products  we may have difficulty in bringing these products to market 
in addition  once our products are brought to market  their shipment may be delayed or the products may have to be discontinued based on design  mechanical  software  regulatory or other issues 
these matters may adversely affect our business and reputation 
product liability suits against us could result in expensive and time consuming litigation  payment of substantial damages and an increase in our insurance rates 
the sale and use of our products could lead to the filing of product liability claims by persons claiming to have been injured using one of our products or claiming that one of our products failed to perform properly 
a product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming to defend  either of which could materially harm our business or financial condition 
our product liability insurance may not be adequate to protect our assets from the full financial impact of defending a product liability claim 
these claims could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future 

table of contents risks related to our common stock the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially in the future 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  some of which are not in our control  including our ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors 
quarter to quarter variations in our operating results 
announcements regarding clinical activities or new products by us or our competitors 
general conditions in the medical device industry 
changes in our own forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts 
price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market  which have particularly affected the market prices of many medical device companies 
general economic conditions 
in addition  the market for our stock may experience price and volume fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
as a result  you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price at which you purchased them 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if any securities litigation is initiated against us  with or without merit  we could incur substantial cost  and our management s attention and resources could be diverted from our business 
our executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and their affiliates hold a substantial portion of our stock and could exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  regardless of the wishes of other stockholders 
as of may   our executive officers  directors  principal stockholders and individuals or entities affiliated with them beneficially owned in the aggregate approximately of our outstanding common stock 
if some or all of these stockholders act together  they could significantly influence all matters that our stockholders vote upon  including the election of directors and determination of significant corporate actions 
this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change of control transaction that could otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law  and an agreement among certain stockholders and the company  may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
provisions of our amended certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law  including provisions providing for a staggered board of directors  as well as an agreement among certain stockholders and the company granting those stockholders rights of first refusal in the event that one or more of such stockholders either obtains a written bona fide offer from a third party to sell or transfer any of their shares of our common stock  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
item properties our headquarters and manufacturing operations used by both of our business segments are located in a  square foot facility built by the company on acres in mundelein  illinois 
we own the building and property 
additionally  our electrodiagnostics products and systems segment leases three offices overseas with current annual rents of approximately   and  we believe that these facilities are adequate to perform our production  research and development  and general and administrative activities for the foreseeable future

see item business cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
overview we are a healthcare technology company operating in two segments computerized medical electro diagnostic products and systems  and related supplies  service  warranty and repair 
our customers are generally hospitals  clinics  universities and physicians 
our systems conduct tests that are typically used by medical practitioners to aid in the diagnosis of certain neurological disorders  brain disorders and tumors  sensory disorders  sleep disorders  and hearing loss including audiological and hearing screening and diagnosis 
our electro diagnostic products and systems segment accounted for over of our total net sales in the fiscal year ended february   consistent with the historical contributions of this segment to our total net sales 
system sales typically represent capital expenditures on the part of our customers 
the us hearing screening market continues to decline and become a replacement market  with an estimated of the estimated million newborns now being screened 
our focus for these systems will be on diagnostic products for babies referred for further testing after initial screening  such as m a s t e r tm that has gained strong acceptance by audiologists for aiding in the determination of appropriate therapies to benefit the infant 
the eeg market for short term eeg and long term monitoring is essentially flat  with significant competition from a feature and technology point of view 
our sleep diagnostic products and systems are in a growing market  for sleep apnea monitoring 
we have experienced some price erosion in sleep diagnostic systems as a result of the strong competition in this area 
the timing on system sales can be affected by many factors  including features  pricing  order size especially for neurology system sales to hospitals  customers trial periods and approval processes  and the hospital or medical practitioner s capital availability 
these factors can materially impact revenues and earnings from one quarter to the next 
our supplies  warranty  service and repair segment sells disposable products to our installed customer base as well as to owners of our competitors systems 
certain proprietary hearing products such as the ear muffin transducer are the basis for much of the revenue and profit growth in this segment 
we experience intense competition related to our ear muffin tm products  which are designed for use on bio logic s systems  as well as for use as an equivalent product to replace the natus flexicoupler disposable 
in addition to the one year warranty that is provided as part of purchasing our electrodiagnostic systems  we offer our customers extended warranties up to five years 
we also generate revenue by servicing and repairing customer systems that are out of warranty 
we also generate a small part of our revenue from governmental research grants 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
they are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenue recognition  inventory valuation and the capitalization of software costs 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned  in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  specifically  when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  
table of contents delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
set up and training revenue related to system sales is not recognized until the service is completed 
with the exception of domestic customers associated with certain group purchasing contracts  the terms of sale for systems and related supplies are generally fob shipping point 
revenue from the performance of non warranty repair activities is recognized in the period in which the work is performed 
revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized over the life of the warranty 
all sales are final  there is no general right for a customer  dealer or distributor to return our products 
any exception regarding product returns requires senior management approval 
a small sales reserve exists to cover potential future product returns  as well as unperformed set up and training 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this estimate is based on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions  and the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation inventories  consist principally of components  parts  supplies  and demonstration equipment  and are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence and for unmarketability  equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demands or market conditions were to be less favorable than what was projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
due to proprietary nature of many of our raw materials and components  we generally do not sell excess or absolete inventory to third parties 
demonstration inventory is sold at a discount  thus generating similar margins to new systems sold 
capitalization of software costs capitalized software costs for research and development are amortized over a five year period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews the valuation of these software costs to determine if there has been impairment to the carrying value of these assets  and adjusts this value accordingly 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies relating to fair value of financial instruments  depreciation  and income taxes require judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple external sources of authoritative guidance such as the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which provides a summary of our significant accounting policies 
dollar amounts in the following discussion are in thousands except for per share amounts 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal worldwide net sales for fiscal were  a decrease from fiscal sales of  our domestic net sales  which include sales in canada  were  for fiscal  or of our total net sales 
this represents an decrease from  or of total sales  in fiscal domestic electro diagnostic products and systems sales decreased over fiscal we experienced domestic sales declines in our neurology  sleep and hearing screening products  due to heightened competitive activity and longer decision making cycles for large capital projects in hospitals  and to a maturing domestic market for hearing screening 
our hearing diagnostic product family experienced significant growth domestically  led by our navigator pro product featuring our m 
a 
s 
t 
e 
r technology 
our domestic supplies  service  warranty  and repair sales increased over fiscal  primarily in the supplies area 

table of contents international sales represented of our net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal international sales of  were up from  in fiscal international electro diagnostic products and systems increased  reflecting strong hearing screening and diagnostic markets in europe and south america 
also  international sales in the supplies warranty service repair area were up over fiscal  due primarily to increased supply sales 
gross margins for fiscal improved to from in fiscal  primarily the result of sales mix changes to our more profitable products within our electro diagnostic products and systems segment  and to a lesser degree the result of favorable sales mix changes in the supplies warranty service repair segment  mainly a result of our sales and marketing efforts on our higher margin proprietary disposable supplies 
effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal we began recording royalty and intangible amortization expenses in cost of sales rather than in research and development 
the total dollar amount was not material enough to require a restatement of these these expenses from the earlier quarters of the fiscal year 
we anticipate that our fiscal gross margins will be reduced by percentage points  with an offsetting reduction in our research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were  lower than the fiscal level of  as a percentage of net sales  at  sg a expenses in fiscal were essentially flat to the fiscal level of

we have a self funded medical plan with stop loss insurance for our employees 
we currently carry a  receivable on our balance sheet related to a claim incurred by one of the plan s participants 
we have paid the medical providers  and are currently in the process of seeking reimbursement from medicare 
the amount not paid by medicare would then be collected from our stop loss insurance carrier 
it is possible that we will be reimbursed for the full amount of this receivable 
however  if we subsequently determine that the carrying value of this asset needs to be reduced or written off completely  this will have a material unfavorable impact on our sg a expenses 
research and development r d costs for fiscal were  a increase over the fiscal level of  as a percent of net sales  fiscal r d expenses were  compared to in fiscal the increase in fiscal expenses was predominantly due to an approximately reduction in the level of net capitalized research and development costs  partially offset by a reduction of approximately in consulting expenses 
we capitalized of software development costs in fiscal  compared to in fiscal additionally  our fiscal amortization expense related to these software development costs increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  due to having a greater amount of the capitalized r d placed in service and subject to amortization 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal we began recording royalty expense and intangible amortization expenses  previously recorded in r d  into cost of sales 
the fiscal fourth quarter impact of that change was a reduction in r d 
we had operating income in fiscal of  compared to  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower sales volume and lower net capitalized software development costs  partially offset by improved gross margins and reduced operating expenses

fiscal compared to fiscal worldwide sales for fiscal were  a decrease from fiscal sales of  domestic sales  which include canada  were  for fiscal  or of our total sales 
this represents a decrease from  or of total sales  in fiscal domestic electro diagnostic products and systems decreased in fiscal from fiscal  primarily due to a million one time sale of hearing screening and diagnostic products to the province of ontario  canada in fiscal market conditions affecting the industry s capital purchasing patterns on some products and systems  as well as a maturing domestic market for others contributed to lower product and systems sales 
although we experienced sales reductions in systems and products  there was significant  but not offsetting  growth in our supplies  warranty  service and repair sales segment  especially of our disposable hearing supplies  almost doubling the amount of hearing supply sales from fiscal levels 
warranty and service revenue also showed strong improvement in this area over fiscal  due to a higher installed base of our systems 
international sales represented of our sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal sales of  were up from  in fiscal  reflective of a strong market for our hearing diagnostic products in europe and south america 
international sales of our navigator pro product line more than doubled over the fiscal level 
we also had strong sales internationally in fiscal in the supplies  warranty  service and repair area  more than doubling the sales volume experienced in fiscal gross margins for fiscal improved to from in fiscal this improvement was primarily the result of our recording of a one time inventory obsolescence charge of approximately million in fiscal  due to accelerated obsolescence of older technology resulting from rapid customer acceptance of new product releases

the deferred tax assets related to foreign taxable income increased due to the end of the tax holiday in certain jurisdictions  and the deferred assets will be realized at higher rates

liquidity and capital resources as of february   we had working capital of  compared to  at february  total cash and cash equivalents increased  from  at february  to  at february  net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to higher net income and reduced inventory levels  offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to high sales levels in the fourth quarter  a decrease in accounts payable due to differences in the timing of year end disbursements  and lower accrued income taxes related to the tax credits for prior years filed and recorded in the current year 
net inventory of  at the end of fiscal was  or  lower than net inventory in fiscal much of this reduction was due to the high level of shipment activity that occurred in the fourth quarter of the year 
we expect overall inventory levels to increase to more sustainable levels during fiscal we manage inventory by using a metric of days inventory on hand dioh  which relates the dollar amount of ending inventory levels to the amount of cost of sales that it generated 
dioh for fiscal was days  a day improvement over the fiscal dioh of days  indicating that we supported our sales in fiscal with a lower inventory investment than was used in fiscal accounts receivable increased in fiscal  due mainly to the increase in year end sales volume over the fiscal fourth quarter 
fourth quarter net sales of  represented the strongest sales quarter of fiscal  and were higher than the  of fourth quarter sales in fiscal we manage receivables through two key measurements days sales outstanding dso  and the dollar amount of receivables over days past due 
dso allows us to analyze changes in our receivables balance as a function of the sales that generated that balance  rather than simply by looking at the dollar change in the account on a standalone basis 
we use the exhaustion method to calculate dso  which assumes that the receivables balance was generated from the most recent sales 
using this methodology  our fiscal dso of days months of sales in our receivables balance remained unchanged from the fiscal level  even though our net receivables balance increased 
our other receivables measurement of past due balances greater than days indicates to us the risk of 
table of contents uncollectibility that could exist in our balances 
at february   our receivable balance past due greater than days was reduced by from fiscal s balance  this improvement in the level of past due receivables allowed us to reduce our reserve for bad debts by in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal we incurred in capital spending for property  plant and equipment  and recorded a receivable related to medical claims that we expect to be reimbursed either by medicare or by our stop loss insurance carrier during fiscal this use of cash was partially offset by a reduction of long term trade receivables  and the reimbursement of split dollar key man life insurance premiums

we believe our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future will be satisfied by available cash balances and cash flows from operations 
as of february   our cash balances of  represented of our total assets  and we had no interest bearing debt 
to the extent our capital and liquidity requirements are not satisfied by available cash balances and cash flows from operations  we have available to us a  unsecured bank line of credit  with an interest rate set at the bank s prime rate 
from time to time  we explore various corporate finance transactions such as business combinations or acquisitions  certain of which may include the issuance of our securities 
however  we have no agreements or commitments with respect to any particular transaction and there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be completed 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at february   and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods

 consolidation of variable interest entities  and revises the requirements for consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities with specific characteristics 
the new consolidation requirements related to variable interest entities are required to be adopted no later than the first reporting period that ends after december  we do not expect adoption of this revised interpretation to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

it applies to all deliverables within contractually binding arrangements in all industries under which a vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities  with limited exceptions 
it is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  as the higher level authoritative literature of sop  software revenue recognition  provides comprehensive guidance to us for revenue recognition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and variable rate short term cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income 
at current investment levels  our results of operations and statement of financial condition would vary by approximately  for every change in our short term interest rate 
exchange rate risk is not material for us 
less than us  resides in accounts denominated in foreign currency 
also  virtually all of our sales transactions are denominated in united states dollars  essentially eliminating the impact of exchange rates on the carrying value of our assets 
finally  the united states dollar is our functional currency for our israeli operation  so there are no transaction or translation exchange rate issues associated with that operation
