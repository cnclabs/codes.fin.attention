introduction we generate revenue through the sale  license and lease of products and services for information lifecycle management 
the demand for our products is correlated  in general  to the worldwide economy  and more specifically  to the demand for it infrastructure 
we experienced a decline in demand for our products and services in and compared to the late s and commencing in  we began to implement programs to reduce costs and to focus our efforts on areas we considered strategic in order to return to profitability 
as a result of various initiatives  as well as an increase in demand for it infrastructure  we returned to profitability in our financial objective is to achieve profitable growth

the brazilian line requires us to borrow in brazilian currency 
as of december   we had outstanding on the brazilian line of credit and there were no borrowings outstanding on the us line of credit 
the brazilian credit line bears interest at the rate quoted by the lender at december  and requires us to meet certain financial covenants with respect to limitations on losses and maintaining minimum levels of cash and investments 
in the event the covenants are not met  the lender may require us to provide collateral to secure the outstanding balance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants 
the brazilian line of credit is denominated in local currency and as such  bears an interest rate commensurate with local currency short term interest rates 
we derive revenues from both selling and leasing activity 
we customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity 
generally  we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes 
if recourse is retained  we assess and provide for any estimated exposure

the collateral is generally cash  us government backed securities or letters of credit 
at december   there were no outstanding securities lending transactions 
based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts  we believe that the combination of funds currently available  funds to be generated from operations and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for the next twelve months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results

off balance sheet arrangements  contingent liabilities and commitments guarantees and indemnification obligations emc s subsidiaries have entered into arrangements with financial institutions to provide guarantees for rent  taxes  insurance  leases  performance bonds  bid bonds and customs duties aggregating as of december  the guarantees vary in length of time 
in connection with these arrangements  we have agreed to guarantee substantially all of the guarantees provided by these financial institutions 
we have also agreed to guarantee our brazilian subsidiary s line of credit 
as of december   we had outstanding on this line of credit 
we enter into agreements in the ordinary course of business with  among others  customers  resellers  oems  systems integrators and distributors 
most of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against third party claims alleging that an emc product infringes a patent or copyright 
certain of these agreements require us to indemnify the other party against certain claims relating to property damage  personal injury or the acts or omissions of emc  its employees  agents or representatives 
in addition  from time to time we have made certain guarantees regarding the performance of our systems to our customers 
we have agreements with certain vendors  financial institutions  lessors and service providers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify the other party for certain matters  such as acts and omissions of emc  its employees  agents or representatives 
we have procurement or license agreements with respect to technology that is used in our products and agreements in which we obtain rights to a product from an oem 
under certain of these agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the supplier for certain claims that may be brought against such party with respect to our acts or omissions relating to the supplied products or technologies 
we have agreed to indemnify the directors and executive officers of emc corporation and our subsidiaries to the extent legally permissible  against all liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with any action in which such individual may be involved by reason of such individual being or having been a director or officer 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we have agreed to indemnify the current and former directors  officers and employees of the acquired company in accordance with the acquired company s by laws and charter in effect immediately prior to the acquisition or in accordance with indemnification or similar agreements entered into by the acquired company and such persons 
in a substantial majority of instances  we have maintained the acquired company s directors and officers insurance  which should enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
in connection with certain dispositions  we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain matters  such as breaches of representations and warranties 
these indemnities vary in length of time 
based upon our historical experience and information known as of december   we believe our liability on the above guarantees and indemnities at december  is not material 
notes and accounts receivable we derive revenues from both selling and leasing information storage systems 
we customarily sell the notes receivable resulting from our leasing activity to provide for current liquidity 
generally  we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes 
from time to time  we may also sell accounts receivable when it is economically beneficial 
litigation on september   hewlett packard company hp filed a complaint against us in the united states federal district court for the northern district of california alleging that certain of our products infringe seven hp patents 
hp seeks a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement 
we believe that hp s claims are without merit 
on july   we answered the complaint and filed counterclaims alleging that certain hp products infringe six emc patents 
emc seeks a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement 
on september   emc filed a complaint against hp in the united states federal district court in worcester  massachusetts 
the complaint alleged that certain hp products infringe six emc patents 
the suit sought a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement 
on june   the parties filed a joint motion to dismiss the suit without prejudice  and thereafter  the suit was dismissed by the court 
we are a party either as plaintiff or defendant to various other patent litigation matters  including certain matters which we assumed in connection with our acquisitions of legato and vmware 
we are a party to other litigation which we consider routine and incidental to our business 
management does not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
pension and post retirement medical and life insurance plans we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan that was assumed as part of the data general acquisition  which covers substantially all former data general employees located in the united states 
certain of the former data general foreign subsidiaries also have foreign retirement plans covering substantially all of their employees 
all of these plans have been frozen resulting in employees no longer accruing pension benefits for future services 
the assets for these defined benefit plans are invested primarily in common stock  bonds and cash equivalent securities 
the market related value of the plans assets is based upon the assets fair value 
the expected long term rate of return on assets for the year ended december  was 
this rate represents the average of the long term rates of return for all defined benefit plans international and us weighted by the plans assets as of december  the actual long term rate of return for the ten years ended december  was 
based upon current market conditions  the expected long term rate of return for will be 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets would have approximately an impact on the pension expense 
as of december   the pension plans had a unrecognized actuarial loss that will be expensed over the average future working lifetime of active participants 
for the year ended december   the discount rate was 
this rate represents the average of the discount rates for all defined benefit plans international and us weighted by plan liabilities as of december  the discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
for the us plan  this rate is based on moody s aa corporate bond index 
for international plans  the rate is based upon comparable high quality corporate bond yields 
a basis point change in the discount rate would have approximately a impact on the pension expense for all plans international and us we also assumed a post retirement benefit plan as part of the data general acquisition that provides certain medical and life insurance benefits for retired former data general employees 
the plan s assets are invested primarily in common stock  bonds and cash equivalent securities 
the market related value of the plan s assets is equal to the assets fair value 
the expected long term rate of return on the plan s assets for the year ended december  was 
based on current capital market conditions  the expected long term rate of return for will remain at 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on the plan s assets has minimal impact on our benefit expense 
as of december   the plan had a unrecognized actuarial gain that will be recognized over anticipated remaining years of service for participants 
for the year ended december   the discount rate was 
the discount rate is based on moody s aa corporate bond index 
a basis point change in the discount rate has a minimal impact on the expense 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition is governed by various accounting principles  including staff accounting bulletin sab  no 
 revenue recognition  emerging issues task force  no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  fas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  fas no 
 accounting for leases  and sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  among others 
the application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction and whether the sale or lease includes systems  software and services or a combination of these items 
as our business evolves  the mix of products and services sold will impact the timing of when revenue and related costs are recognized 
additionally  revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns and the likelihood of nonpayment 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience and market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments on these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
should market or economic conditions deteriorate  our actual return experience could exceed our estimate 
warranty costs we accrue for systems warranty costs at the time of shipment 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  the amount of actual warranty costs could materially differ from our estimates 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts and notes receivable  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts and notes receivable are evaluated based upon the credit worthiness of our customers  our historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate 
the recoverability of inventories is based upon the types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand  pricing  competition and changes in technology 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate  our actual recovery could be less than our estimate 
other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
our goodwill valuation is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis performed at the reporting unit level 
the analysis factors in estimated revenue and expense growth rates 
the estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  factoring in customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenues 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
restructuring charges we recognized restructuring charges in  and the restructuring charges include  among other items  estimated losses on the sale of real estate  employee termination benefit costs  subletting of facilities and termination of various contracts 
the amount of the actual obligations may be different than our estimates due to various factors  including market conditions and negotiations with third parties 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is more likely than not  do not establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued fasb interpretations fin no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin no 
provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights called variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin no

our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of general economic and market conditions 
we are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions 
our operating results were materially adversely affected in and as a result of unfavorable economic conditions 
if economic and market conditions deteriorate  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the information technology market 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our products and services 
our operating results were materially adversely affected in and as a result of reduced it spending 
recently  we have experienced an increase in demand for our products and services  however  delays or reductions in it spending  domestically or internationally  could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions and investments 
as part of our business strategy  we seek to acquire businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these acquisitions  including our acquisitions of legato in october  documentum in december and vmware in january  are accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business  which may include  among other things the effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation the failure of an acquired business to further our strategies the failure of the acquisition to result in expected benefits  which may include benefits relating to enhanced revenues  technology  human resources  costs savings  operating efficiencies and other synergies the difficulty and cost of integrating the acquired business  including costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures and costs and delays caused by communication difficulties or geographic distances between the two companies sites the assumption of liabilities of the acquired business  including litigation related liabilities the potential impairment of acquired assets the lack of experience in new markets  products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners the diversion of our management s attention from other business concerns the impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers of the acquired business or our customers or suppliers the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company the potential incompatibility of business cultures these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
to the extent that we issue shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase common stock in connection with any future acquisition  existing stockholders may experience dilution and our earnings per share may decrease 
in addition to the risks commonly encountered in the acquisition of a business as described above  we may also experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction 
further  the risks described above may be exacerbated as a result of managing the acquisitions of multiple acquisitions at the same time 
we also seek to invest in businesses that offer complementary products  services or technologies 
these investments are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business 
competitive pricing  component costs and sales volume could materially adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and earnings 
competitive pricing pressures exist in the information storage market 
there also has been and may continue to be a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices or provide storage related products or services  together with other it products or services  at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share 
we currently believe that pricing pressures are likely to continue 
to date  we have been able to manage our component and product design costs 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to achieve reductions in component and product design costs 
moreover  certain competitors may have advantages due to vertical integration of their supply chain  which may include disk drives  microprocessors  memory components and servers 
our gross margins are impacted by a variety of factors  including competitive pricing  component and product design costs as well as the volume and relative mixture of product and services revenues 
increased pricing pressures  increased component costs  the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in product price and component costs  changes in product and services revenue mixture or decreased volume could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  gross margins or earnings 
if our suppliers are not able to meet our requirements  we could have decreased revenues and earnings 
we purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers  including some of our competitors 
these components and products include disk drives  high density memory components  power supplies and software developed and maintained by third parties 
we have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements 
if any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products  we could lose time sensitive customer orders  be unable to develop or sell certain products cost effectively or on a timely basis  if at all  and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies 
the importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to new technologies  along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales  intensifies the risk that the failure of a supplier to meet our quality or delivery requirements will have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
we may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry  technological and market changes 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers 
there can be no assurance that our existing products will be properly positioned in the market or that we will be able to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis  or at all 
we spend a considerable amount of money on research and development and introduce new products from time to time 
there can be no assurance that enhancements to existing products or new products will receive customer acceptance 
as competition in the it industry increases  it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage and to leverage that advantage toward increased revenues and profits 
risks associated with the development and introduction of new products include delays in development and changes in data storage  networking and operating system technologies which could require us to modify existing products 
risks inherent in the transition to new products include the difficulty in forecasting customer preferences or demand accurately the inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products the impact of customers demand for new products on the products being replaced  thereby causing a decline in sales of existing products and an excessive  obsolete supply of inventory delays in initial shipments of new products 
further risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price performance relative to products of competitors  competitors responses to the introductions and the desire by customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time 
our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis  keep pace with rapid industry  technological or market changes or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the markets we serve are highly competitive  and we may be unable to compete effectively 
we compete with many companies in the markets we serve  certain of which offer a broad spectrum of it products and services and others which offer specific information storage or management products or services 
some of these companies whether independently or by establishing alliances may have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources  larger distribution capabilities  earlier access to customers and greater opportunity to address customers various it requirements than us 
we compete on the basis of our products features  performance and price as well as our services 
our failure to compete on any of these bases could affect demand for our products or services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
companies may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us 
our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products  including hardware and software products  and services by our competitors  and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors 
in addition  as we continue to increase our software and services businesses  we may face new competitive challenges 
we may have difficulty managing operations 
our future operating results will depend on our overall ability to manage operations  which includes  among other things retaining and hiring  as required  the appropriate number of qualified employees enhancing  as appropriate  our infrastructure  including but not limited to  our information systems accurately forecasting revenues training our sales force to sell more software and services successfully integrating new acquisitions managing inventory levels  including minimizing excess and obsolete inventory  while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet customer demands controlling expenses managing our manufacturing capacity  real estate facilities and other assets executing on our plans an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war or acts of terrorism 
terrorist acts or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our employees  facilities  customers  partners  suppliers and distributors and resellers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
such conflicts may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment  including receipt of components and distribution of products 
our business may suffer if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel 
our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees  the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel 
the loss of one or more key or other employees  our inability to attract additional qualified employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
historically uneven sales patterns could significantly impact our quarterly revenues and earnings 
our quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter s total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter 
this pattern makes prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period especially difficult and uncertain and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
we believe this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors including the size of our product and services prices in relation to our customers budgets  resulting in long lead times for customers budgetary approval  which tends to be given late in a quarter the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business the fourth quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first quarter of the following year seasonal influences our uneven sales pattern also makes it extremely difficult to predict near term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity accordingly 
if predicted demand is substantially greater than orders  there will be excess inventory 
alternatively  if orders substantially exceed predicted demand  the ability to assemble  test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited  which could materially adversely affect quarterly revenues and earnings 
in addition  our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter and our backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of future sales levels 
this is because we assemble our products on the basis of our forecast of near term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers we generally ship products shortly after receipt of the order customers may reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty loss of infrastructure  due to factors such as an information systems failure  loss of public utilities or extreme weather conditions  could impact our ability to ship products in a timely manner 
delays in product shipping or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses  could intensify the impact of these factors on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
risks associated with our distribution channels may materially adversely affect our financial results 
in addition to our direct sales force  we have agreements in place with many distributors  systems integrators  resellers and original equipment manufacturers to market and sell our products and services 
we may  from time to time  derive a significant percentage of our revenues from such distribution channels 
our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated  if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate or if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken 
in addition  as our market opportunities change  we may have an increased reliance on channel partners  which may negatively impact our gross margins 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels 
if we are not successful  we may lose sales opportunities  customers and market share 
furthermore  the partial reliance on channel partners may materially reduce the visibility to our management of potential customers and demand for products and services  thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such demand 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop  market or sell products or services in competition with us in the future 
changes in foreign conditions could impair our international operations 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the united states 
in addition  a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade restrictions  import or export licensing requirements  the overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws  changes in regulatory requirements  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and longer payment cycles in certain countries 
undetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results 
if flaws in design  production  assembly or testing of our products by us or our suppliers were to occur  we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial repair  replacement or service costs and potential damage to our reputation 
continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities  control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth 
there can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor  develop  modify and implement appropriate test and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to permit us to avoid a rate of failure in our products that results in substantial delays in shipment  significant repair or replacement costs or potential damage to our reputation  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances 
we have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
there can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances  certain of which have substantially greater financial  marketing or technological resources than us  will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future  discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors 
our business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property 
we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the united states and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
however  there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
therefore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third party copying or use  which could adversely affect our competitive position 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that  if obtainable  such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost 
from time to time  we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent or other intellectual property rights 
responding to any such claim  regardless of its merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party  and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 
in the ordinary course of business  we may become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and governmental proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses 
additionally  the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
from time to time  we are subject to income tax audits 
while we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  there could be a material adverse affect on our results of operations or financial condition 
changes in regulations could materially adversely affect us 
our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if laws  regulations or standards relating to us or our products are newly implemented or changed 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as the announcement of acquisitions  new products  services or technological innovations by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our operating results changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community speculation in the press or investment community in addition  our stock price is affected by general economic and market conditions and has been negatively affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions 
if such conditions deteriorate  our stock price could decline 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and credit risk 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a multinational corporation  we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
any foreign currency transaction  defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  will be reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate 
asset and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period 
the primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resultant accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our balance sheet 
therefore  the change in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we enter into derivative contracts with the sole objective of decreasing the volatility of the impact of currency fluctuations 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposure has related to sales denominated in the euro  the brazil real  the japanese yen and the british pound 
additionally  we have exposure to emerging market economies  particularly in latin america and south east asia 
despite the relatively small size of our exposure in these markets  the inherent volatility of these economies could negatively impact our financial results 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
in all cases  we use these derivative instruments to reduce our foreign exchange risk by essentially creating offsetting market exposures 
the success of the hedging program depends on our forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
the instruments we hold are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculative purposes 
we employ a variance covariance model to calculate value at risk for our combined foreign exchange position 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day 
estimates of volatility and correlations of market factors are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset as of december  this model measures the potential loss in fair value that could arise from changes in market conditions  using a confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
the value at risk on the combined foreign exchange position was million as of december  and million as of december  the average  high and low value at risk amounts for and were as follows in millions average high low the average value represents an average of the quarter end values 
the high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts 
interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various types and maturities 
the investments are classified as available for sale and are all denominated in us dollars 
these securities are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
these instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes 
a portion of our investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment risk

the high and low valuations represent the highest and lowest values of the quarterly amounts 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  short and long term investments and trade and notes receivable 
we place our temporary cash investments and short and long term investments primarily in investment grade instruments and limit the amount of investment in any one issuer 
during  we purchased bank loans with credit ratings below investment grade 
the bank loans have a senior position to other debt and have floating rate coupons  which significantly reduces interest rate risk 
as of december   bank loans represent of our temporary cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
we believe this investment strategy more effectively manages our exposure to interest rate risk and diversifies our investment portfolio across different risk factors 
we employ a variance covariance model to calculate value at risk for changes in credit conditions for our bank loan portfolios 
this model assumes that the relationships among market rates and prices that have been observed over the last year are valid for estimating risk over the next trading day

the value at risk on the bank loan portfolios was million as of december  the average  high and low value at risk amount for were as follows in millions average high low the credit risk associated with accounts and notes receivables is low due to the large number of customers and their broad dispersion over many different industries and geographic areas 
we establish allowance for the estimated uncollectible portion of our accounts and notes receivable 
the allowance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we customarily sell the notes receivable we derive from our leasing activity 
generally  we do not retain any recourse on the sale of these notes
