the company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements 
the company does not undertake and specifically declines any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss given default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 

next page general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments  service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by non bank subsidiaries and divisions and other general operating income 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  postage  insurance  advertising  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank 
recent accounting pronouncements in january the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires the consolidation of certain special purpose entities spe s by a company if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the spe s operating activities 
one financial liability of the company that is impacted by fin is the company s trust preferred securities and related debentures 
this liability is  and has been  presented in the company s financial statements as a liability and not a component of equity for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  the federal reserve board has allowed these securities to be included as capital for purposes of regulatory capital calculations 
the fasb has issued a revised interpretation of fin  which must be applied to certain variable instruments by march  at that time the company expects for financial reporting purposes to de consolidate the trust and to instead report the junior subordinated debentures of the company owned by the trust 
this is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
to date  no final determination has been reached for regulatory reporting purposes and the federal reserve board has instructed bank holding companies to continue to include these securities in regulatory capital calculations until further notice 

next page in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  acounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas modifies the accounting for certain financial instruments that issuers previously could account for as equity 
under sfas  certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity must be classified as liabilities in the balance sheets  with the corresponding payment to holders of the instruments recognized as interest expense 
the adoption of this standard had no impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company as the company s trust preferred securities were already classified as liabilities on the company s balance sheets and recorded as interest expense on the statements of income

the allowance for loan losses decreased  or  at december  compared to december  management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 

next page our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is great southern s most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is nearly neutral 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends  and the board of directors sets  the asset and liability policies of great southern  which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 

next page in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern
