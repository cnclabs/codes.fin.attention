general we design  market and sell contemporary footwear for men  women and children under the skechers brand 
our footwear is sold through a wide range of department stores and leading specialty retail stores  a growing network of our own retail stores and our e commerce website 
our objective is to continue to profitably grow our domestic operations  while leveraging our brand name to expand internationally 
we generate revenues from the following three principal sources wholesale 
we sell footwear directly to department stores and specialty retail stores both domestically and internationally 
retail 
we own and operate our own retail stores both domestically and internationally through three integrated retail formats 
the utilization of three distinct retail formats is to appeal to a broad range of customers that are segmented by price points and allows us to manage inventory in an efficient and brand sensitive manner 
our three retail formats are as follows concept stores 
our concept stores are located in marquee street locations and high performing regional malls  promote awareness of the skechers brand and showcase a broad assortment of our in season footwear styles 
the products offered in our concept stores are full price in season products and typically attract fashion conscious customers 
our proto typical concept store is approximately  square feet and generates gross margins that are the highest of our three retail formats 
factory outlet stores 
our factory outlet stores are generally located in manufacturers outlet centers and provide opportunities to sell an assortment of in season  discontinued and excess merchandise at lower price points 
our factory outlet stores range in size from  square feet to  square feet and generally have price points less of or lower 
gross margins generated from our factory outlet stores are less than those in our concept stores 

table of contents warehouse outlet stores 
our freestanding warehouse outlet stores appeal to our most value conscious customers and enable us to liquidate excess merchandise  discontinued lines and odd size inventory in a cost efficient manner 
these stores allow us to sell discontinued and excess merchandise  thereby reducing the need to sell merchandise to discounters at excessively low prices  which could compromise the skechers brand 
distributors 
internationally  we sell our footwear to our foreign distributors who distribute such footwear to department stores and specialty retail stores in europe  asia  latin america  south america and numerous other countries and territories 
financial overview we have two reportable business segments  domestic wholesale and distributor sales 
our domestic wholesale segment is our largest distribution channel comprising  and of our net sales for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our distributor sales comprised   and of our consolidated net sales for the years ended december    and  respectively 
gross margins provided by our distribution channels are such that  our retail sales achieve higher gross margins as a percentage of net sales than domestic wholesale sales 
sales through foreign distributors result in lower gross margins as a percentage of net sales than retail or wholesale sales 
none of our domestic retail sales formats  international wholesale sales  or international retail sales comprised more than of our consolidated net sales for either fiscal  or we had realized rapid growth since inception  increasing net sales from million in to million in however during and  we saw our net sales decline  by and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  when compared to the prior year 
the decline in net sales during from was primarily due to reduced domestic wholesale sales and  although to a lesser extent  reduced sales to our international distributors 
our distributor sales have decreased in part due to the expansion of our international direct selling efforts  which sales are classified as international wholesale  as compared to distributor sales in prior years 
during  our domestic wholesale sales declined on a decline in unit sales volume  and in a decrease in the average price per pair sold 
as a result  we realized a decrease in margins  which declined to in compared to in the decrease in average price per pair sold  and the negative impact on margins in was due to various factors 
first  was the build up of committed inventory which includes inventory on hand and in transit from the factory which is on our books and inventory in process at the factory which is not in our books from our third party manufacturers at december  the increase in committed inventory was to take advantage of at once orders during the first half of  which did not materialize to the levels we had anticipated 
second  as a result of our at once orders not achieving the levels expected  we ended up with higher than anticipated inventory levels  which reached a high of million at june  as a result  we undertook an aggressive sales strategy to significantly reduce our inventory levels in an already difficult retail environment  one where consumers were seeking product markdowns at the retail level 
this sales strategy was initiated into both of our domestic and international wholesale distribution channels 
third  we saw a decrease in demand for some of our product lines that had traditionally made up a larger portion of our domestic wholesale sales 
we continually update  modify and expand our product offerings based on current and expected trends  which may include the addition of new styles within existing product lines  such as within our skechers work and skechers sport lines  and in some cases the addition of new product lines such as our michelle k sport line and our high end men s line mark nason 
offsetting the decline in our domestic wholesale sales was a increase in our retail sales 
the increase was due to the net increase of retail stores during  and the incremental effect of having the retail stores we opened in open for all of at december   we had retail stores opened worldwide and we currently believe that we have established our presence in most major markets 
as such  we currently feel that we are now able to curtail our retail expansion  and therefore  we currently have plans to open four domestic  and no international  retail stores in during  we recorded an impairment charge of  to write off the fixed assets at three of our domestic retail stores 
further  we are carefully reviewing our under performing stores and may consider the non renewal of leases at lease renewal 
during  we continued our international expansion with the establishment of international subsidiaries in canada  the netherlands  and italy 
these subsidiaries support our direct selling efforts in those countries and are in addition to our subsidiaries established in the united kingdom  germany  france and spain 
we currently believe that we have developed our international direct selling efforts  therefore  we currently do not anticipate entering any new international markets in instead  we will focus on i enhancing the efficiency of our international operations  ii increasing our customer base  iii increasing the product count within each customer  and iv tailoring our product offerings currently available to our international customers to increase demand for our product 
we believe that selective licensing of the skechers brand name to non footwear related manufacturers may broaden and enhance the skechers image without requiring us to expend significant capital investments or incur significant incremental operating expenses 

table of contents during  we continued to increase our licensing opportunities and have now signed domestic and three international licensing agreements in the last two years 
our licensing agreements  which now consist of apparel  accessories  loungewear  and swimwear  cover most of our brand names available for licensing 
our most significant license to date is with kids headquarters for skechers kids apparel  which launched for back to school in due to the successful launch of the kid s apparel line  we have expanded the agreement to include infant and toddler apparel and boys and girls daywear and sleepwear 
as many of our licensing arrangements were signed in  we currently believe that most product offerings will be available in stores by fall year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales for were million an decrease from net sales of million in the decrease in net sales was due to reduced domestic wholesale sales  partially offset by increases in international wholesale and retail sales 
domestic wholesale net sales decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease in domestic wholesale net sales was the result of a decrease in unit sales volume  to million pairs in from pairs million in  and a decrease in the average selling price pair to in from in the anticipated decrease in the average selling price per pair was due to our aggressive selling efforts to relieve our inventory levels that were built up from our inventory commitments at december  we had anticipated that our inventory commitments would be utilized by at once orders in the first half of  however  the level of at once orders during this period were lower than anticipated 
the lower level of at once orders during the first half of allowed our inventory levels to reach a high of million at june  as such we continued our aggressive sales campaign through the end of  which negatively impacted our average selling price per pair 
our distributor net sales decreased  to million in from million in  due to reduced sales into the south american  asian  and mexican markets  as well as the reclassification previously described 
our other segment net sales consist of international wholesale  international and domestic retail sales and e commerce sales 
our international wholesale sales increased  due to expansion of our direct selling efforts into the benelux region  canada  and italy  which were previously classified as distributor sales  offset by reduced sales into the united kingdom and france 
our domestic retail sales increased due to the net addition of domestic retail stores and having the retail stores opened in open the entire year of we currently have domestic retail stores  and currently plan to open four domestic retail store stores in during we closed two retail stores 
we periodically review all of our stores for impairment and or  in the case of under performing stores  store closure 
our international retail sales increased in compared to  due to the addition of six stores and the two stores opened in being open the entire year of we currently do not anticipate opening any international retail stores in our e commerce sales decreased in when compared to our e commerce sales made up less than of our consolidated net sales in both fiscal and during  we began to generate licensing revenues from licensing our brand name and our branded lines to non footwear manufacturers 
our licensing revenues in were derived primarily from our kids apparel licensing agreement with kid s headquarter 
in total  we generated licensing revenues of approximately in fiscal we currently anticipate that licensing fees will increase in fiscal  as additional licensing products become available to consumers 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was million compared to million in gross profit as a percent of net sales was compared to in the decrease in margin was due to the decrease in domestic wholesale margins  which were in compared to in the decrease in domestic wholesale margins was due to our aggressive sales strategy  primarily in the second half of  that we employed in order to reduce our inventory levels 
the effect of this sales strategy was a decrease in the average selling price per pair for the year and a domestic wholesale margin of during the fourth quarter of  compared to in the fourth quarter of offsetting the domestic wholesale margin decrease in fiscal was the increase in our domestic retail sales  which have a higher gross margin than domestic wholesale sales  as they have become a higher percentage of our consolidated net sales 
during the second half of  we moved a significant amount of excess and clearance priced inventory 
however  we have recently begun to ship higher margin products  as such  we currently anticipate that margins during the first quarter of will be approximately 
selling expenses 
table of contents selling expenses for were million  a decrease of million from selling expenses of million in selling expenses as percentage of sales were in compared to in the decrease in selling expenses was primarily due to reduced advertising expenses  which decreased to million in from million in  although because of the reduction in net sales  advertising expense increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the decrease in advertising was due to reduced domestic media ads of approximately million  primarily television and trade print  offset by increased international advertising and promotional costs of approximately million  including a major print campaign featuring international pop star christina aguilera for our women s sport line  as well as increased sample costs of approximately million associated with developing styles for new and existing product lines 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative costs for were million  an increase of over general and administrative expenses of million in general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales were in compared to in the increase in general and administrative expenses was due to increased salaries  wages  taxes and related benefits of million  increased rent of million  increased depreciation million  increased insurance of million  and  of impairment charges related to the write off of fixed assets at three of our domestic retail stores 
the increase in expenses were primarily the result of our continued expansion of both our domestic and international retail operations  in which we added a total of net stores  and establishing subsidiaries in canada  the netherlands  and italy 
during fiscal and  we significantly increased the number of domestic and international retail stores  expanded our direct selling efforts into spain  the benelux region  canada  and italy  and established our european distribution center in belgium to provide inventory fulfillment services to our international customers and our own retail stores 
during this same period  we realized a decrease of and in our consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively  when compared to the prior year 
as a result of our expansion efforts  we have expanded our infrastructure with costs that are fixed in the short term 
as result of the decrease in sales  coupled with an increase in operating expenses associated with our expansion strategies  we realized a deleveraging of our expenses in fiscal  which may continue into as such  we currently do not plan on entering any additional international markets and currently plan to open four domestic  and no international  retail stores in during the fourth quarter  we implemented some initial cost reductions based on our anticipated sales levels  however  we have not yet realized the benefits of those reductions 
we continue to review our cost structure to develop efficiencies within our operations and currently anticipate that any additional cost reduction strategies  if needed  will be made after the first quarter and will be based on our sales outlook for the remainder of fiscal however  at this time we are currently unable to determine the extent  if any  of any anticipated savings in fiscal when compared to interest expense interest expense for fiscal was million consistent with interest expense of million in interest expense is derived from our convertible notes  mortgages on our distribution center and corporate office located in california  our capital lease obligations and interest on amounts owed to our foreign manufacturers 
our total average debt levels and average interest rates have remained comparable from to other income other  net was an expense of  in compared to income of million in the reduction in other  income was due to reduced foreign exchange gains and reduced rent earned from leasing office space at one of our administrative offices in  when compared to income taxes we provided million in income taxes for fiscal despite our generating a pretax loss 
the tax provision was computed using the effective tax rates applicable to each of our domestic and international taxable jurisdictions 
the tax provided was the result of generating tax losses in low tax rate jurisdictions and the inability to use those losses against income in higher rate jurisdictions 
during  our effective tax rate was  which is lower than the expected domestic rate of  due to our international expansion into lower tax rate jurisdictions and our reinvestment of undistributed earnings from our non us subsidiaries  thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance 
as such  we did not provide for deferred income taxes on accumulated undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries 

table of contents year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales for decreased to million compared to million in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to reduced domestic wholesale segment net sales which were million for  compared to million in the decreased sales is attributed to a decrease in unit sales volume to million pairs in compared to million pairs in and a decrease in the average selling price per pair to in compared to in distributor net sales decreased to million in from million in primarily due to decreased sales into the south american market place and the expansion of our international direct selling efforts  whose sales are now classified as international wholesale 
international wholesale net sales increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to our direct sales efforts in place for the full year in compared to approximately nine months in domestic retail sales increased in over  due to the addition of retail stores added during international retail sales increased due to most stores being opened the entire months period in  compared to only a portion in  and to a lesser extent  new flagship stores opened in frankfurt  germany and toronto  canada during the fourth quarter of our direct mail sales decreased over  in compared to due to the elimination of our mail order and catalog operations in october during  we continued to expand internationally by establishing subsidiaries in canada  spain  the benelux region  and in the first quarter of  in italy 
our international subsidiary s infrastructure typically includes a sales and support staff and showroom to present the full range of our product offerings to prospective accounts 
during the year ended december   we opened domestic retails stores five concept stores  five factory outlet stores  and three warehouse outlet stores 
gross profit gross profit for was compared to gross profit of million in gross margin was for compared to for gross margin for the domestic wholesale segment was in compared to in the decrease in gross margin in the domestic wholesale segment was due primarily to concessions given to our wholesale accounts to stimulate sales at retail during a sluggish retail environment  additional costs related to the domestic west coast port strike which lead to additional airfreight costs from our international manufacturers  rerouting of freight to east coast and canadian ports  and the subsequent trucking costs from those ports to our distribution center in ontario  california 
in addition we realized lower margins from our company owned retail stores due to additional sales promotions during compared to selling expenses selling expenses for the were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to compared to in the decrease in selling expense was primarily due to decreased advertising  which was of sales in compared to in advertising expense decreased million in primarily due to fewer domestic print ads  and cable tv ads  other selling expense reductions were realized in trade show expenses of million  and catalog expenses of million  from the discontinuance of our mail order catalog 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in the increase in general and administrative expenses during compared to was due to increased rent approximately million  insurance million  travel million and depreciation charges approximately million related to the addition of retail stores and the full year s effect of the stores added in  infrastructure additions to support our direct selling efforts in the united kingdom  germany  france  and new subsidiaries added in  including spain  canada  and the netherlands and  to a lesser extent  legal reserves and the move into our internally managed distribution center in liege  belgium in the fourth quarter of however  the expense increases noted were partially offset by reduced temporary help costs approximately million at our distribution facility in ontario  california 

table of contents the costs added during this expansion period have not been leveraged over a full year s sales 
we established this infrastructure to achieve economies of scale in anticipation of continued increases in sales 
because expenses relating to this infrastructure are fixed  at least in the short term  operating results and margins would be adversely affected if we do not achieve our anticipated sales growth 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is due to the elimination of our short term borrowings whose interest rate was tied to the prime rate of interest  which has decreased over the last two years and reduced interest rates charged on amounts outstanding with our foreign manufacturers 
other income other income for was million compared to million in the increase in other income was due to foreign exchange gains  offset by decreased rent revenue from the leasing of office space at one of our administrative facilities 
income taxes the effective tax rate in was compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to changes in income in differing tax jurisdictions as a result of our international expansion 
we are expanding our international operations and plan to reinvest any undistributed earnings from our non us subsidiaries  thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance 
as a result  we do not plan to provide for deferred income taxes on any accumulated undistributed earnings that our non us subsidiaries earn in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was million  a decrease of million from working capital of million at december  our cash and cash equivalents at december  were million compared to million at december  the change in net cash was the result of a decrease in cash provided by operating activities  primarily the result of generating a net loss for fiscal  cash used in investing activities of million for capital expenditures related to our investments in our retail stores  international expansion and additional investments in intellectual property  and net cash used in financing activities related to the repayment of long term obligations 
in  our cash balances decreased million  from million at december  to million at december  the significant impacts on cash flows in related to expenditures for certain property and equipment aggregating million and the acquisition of our canadian distributor for million  offset by cash flows from operations of million 
during  we focused on reducing inventories  which decreased by million in as compared to  and using that cash to reduce our accounts payable and accrued expenses  which decreased million in compared to there were no significant changes in cash flow resulting from financing activities 
our main source of borrowings is our convertible subordinated notes aggregating million 
we have no borrowings outstanding under our line of credit and total cash flows used in financing activities were million net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures for fiscal  compared to the same period in  was due to the building of domestic retail stores  which totaled approximately million  equipment and leasehold improvements at our international subsidiaries  international retail stores  and our european distribution center of million 
in addition  we spent million related to the acquisition of our canadian distributor  of which million related to the repurchase of inventory 
we initiated our direct selling efforts in canada in the first quarter of during  we continued to invest in our international expansion efforts by establishing subsidiaries in canada  italy and the netherlands 
these subsidiaries were established to support our direct efforts in those regions 
we also invested in the expansion of our retail stores by opening an additional domestic and international retail stores 
these investments continued throughout fiscal  despite our decrease in consolidated net sales  when compared to our expansion efforts have increased our overhead structure  causing our operating expenses to become a larger portion of net sales in when compared to fiscal we currently believe that we have an international presence in the most favorable international locations and have a retail presence in most major markets both domestically and internationally 
therefore during  we currently do not plan on expanding our direct selling efforts into new international regions 
in addition  we currently do not plan on opening any additional international retail stores in 
table of contents and currently have plans to open four domestic retail stores in we currently expect our capital expenditures for to be approximately million in total  which includes our domestic retail stores  minor capital improvements at our distribution centers and investments in information technology 
we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be funded by cash flows from operations or from funds available from our secured line of credit  of which  there are currently no amounts outstanding 
net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the reduction in cash provided by the exercise of stock options  and prior year including the proceeds from the issuance of our notes  offset by the repayment of our short term borrowings 
in april  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due april  the notes are convertible into shares of our class a common stock 
interest on the notes is paid semi annually on april and october of each year 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of class a common stock at a conversion rate of shares of class a common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment 
the notes may be converted at any time on or before the close of business on the maturity date  unless the notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased  provided  however  that if a note is called for redemption or repurchase  the holder will be entitled to convert the notes at any time before the close of business on the date immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption or repurchase  as the case may be 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated to our present and future senior debt 
the notes are also structurally subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the indenture does not restrict our incurrence of indebtedness  including senior debt  or our subsidiaries incurrence of indebtedness 
net proceeds from the sale of the notes were million 
the refinancing of our short term borrowings with long term capital was done to provide us with long term debt to provide for the future growth of the business 
we have available a secured line of credit  as amended on december   permitting borrowings up to million based upon eligible accounts receivable and inventories 
borrowings bear interest at the prime rate at december  minus  and the agreement expires on december  the agreement provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to a maximum of million of which decreases the amount available for borrowings under the agreement 
outstanding letters of credit at december  were million 
available borrowings under the line of credit at december  were million and no amounts were outstanding at december  and we pay an unused line of credit fee of 
annually 
the agreement provides the following financial covenants should the loan balance exceed of all eligible accounts  that stockholders equity shall not decrease by more than in any given calendar quarter  a tangible net worth be maintained as defined in the agreement  and limits the payment of dividends if in default of any provision of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  available borrowings under our revolving line of credit  cash on hand  proceeds from the issuance of the notes and our financing arrangements will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund our anticipated working capital and capital requirements through fiscal however  in connection with our current strategies  we will incur significant working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the levels at which we maintain inventory  the market acceptance of our footwear  the success of our international operations  the levels of promotion and advertising required to promote our footwear  the extent to which we invest in new product design and improvements to our existing product design and the number and timing of new store openings 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
we cannot be assured that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
failure to obtain such financing could delay or prevent our planned expansion  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible securities  dilution to our stockholders could occur 
disclosure about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table aggregates all material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  
table of contents payments due by period in thousands less than one to three to more than one three five five total year years years years long term obligations other long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually  narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the long term debt consists of our convertible notes receivable due april   and related interest payments due in april and october of each year  unless converted into our class a common stock as provided for in the indenture agreement 
operating lease commitments consists primarily of real property leases for our retail stores  corporate offices  and distribution centers 
these leases frequently include options  which permit us to extend beyond the terms of the initial fixed term 
payments for these lease terms are provided for by cash flows generated from operations or  if needed  by our  secured line of credit  for which no amounts were outstanding at december  purchase obligations includes the following i purchase orders for the purchase footwear  that may be cancelable in certain instances given the timing of cancellation  of million  ii outstanding letters credit of million  and iii open purchase commitments with our foreign manufacturers for million 
we currently expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations 
critical accounting estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates are affected by more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  inventory reserves  valuation of intangible and long lived assets  litigation reserves  and valuations of deferred income taxes 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from the sale of footwear 
in general  revenue is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise 
domestically  goods are shipped directly from our domestic distribution center in ontario  california  and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the distribution center fob shipping point 
for our international wholesale accounts  product is shipped direct from our distribution center in liege  belgium  and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the distribution center 
for our distributor sales  the goods are delivered directly from the independent factories to the distributors on an fob shipping point basis and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the factory 
in all of the above cases  each of the following have been met prior to revenue recognition persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for bad debts  returns  and customer chargebacks 
we insure selected customer account balances both greater than  and accepted by the insurance company should our customer not pay 
we also provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay  and disputed and returned items 
we offer normal trade discounts to our customers 
on occasion we offer our wholesale accounts sales discounts based on various promotional programs  such as trade show promotions  product line discounts  and futures discounts 
all sales are booked net of discount and are recorded at the time of revenue recognition 
all customer returns must have a return authorization number  once the product is returned and processed  we issue a credit to the customer 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions in the customers country or industry  
table of contents historical losses and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
the likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment 
reserves are fully provided for all probable losses of this nature 
for receivables that are not specifically identified as high risk  we provide a reserve based upon a percent of sales for the last three months 
this percentage is based on our historical loss rate 
a change in this rate would not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
gross trade accounts receivable balance was million and the allowance for bad debts  returns  and customer chargebacks was million at december  inventory reserves 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow moving inventory 
our review is based on inventory on hand  prior sales  and our expected net realizable value 
our analysis includes a review of inventory quantities on hand at period end in relation to year to date sales and projections for sales in the near future 
the net realizable value  or market value is determined based on our estimate of sales prices of such inventory through off price or discount store channels 
a write down of inventory is considered permanent and creates a new cost basis for those units 
the likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent primarily on our expectation of future consumer demand for our product 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of future consumer demand for our product or the economy  or other failure to estimate correctly  could result in inventory valuation changes  either favorably or unfavorably  compared to the requirement determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
at december   our gross inventory value was million  and our inventory reserve was million 
valuation of long lived assets 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the impairment of long lived assets that require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
in addition  we prepare a summary of store contribution from our retail stores to assess potential impairment of the leasehold improvements 
stores with negative contribution opened in excess of twelve months are then reviewed in detail to determine if impairment exists 
at december   we recorded an impairment charge for leasehold improvements at three of our retail stores totaling  litigation reserves 
estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as such  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of our deferred tax assets depends on future taxable income and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies amongst the various domestic and international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we evaluate our projections of taxable income to determine the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and the need for an evaluation allowance 

table of contents inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on our sales or profitability 
however  we cannot accurately predict the effect of inflation on future operating results 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our sales or profitability 
while we have been able to offset our foreign product cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers in the past  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to make such increases or changes in the future 
exchange rates we receive us dollars for substantially all of our product sales and our royalty income 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future 
during and  exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on our inventory costs 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk
