item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the fiscal years ended september   october  and october   should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  opinions  expectations  anticipations and intentions and beliefs 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under the risk factors  special note about forward looking statements and business sections and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in the following discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition  certain financial measures may be considered non gaap financial measures under securities and exchange commission rules 
these rules require supplemental explanation and reconciliation  which is provided in exhibit to this annual report on form k  and is incorporated by reference herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
as described in such notes  the company recognizes sales in the period in which services are provided pursuant to the terms of our contractual relationships with our clients 
in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the more significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
asset impairment determinations as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized 
under this accounting standard  goodwill is subject to an impairment test that we conduct at least annually  using a discounted cash flow technique 
with respect to our other long lived assets  we are required to test for asset impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in order to determine whether or not an asset was impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
in making future cash flow analyses of various assets  the company makes assumptions relating to the following the intended use of assets and the expected future cash flows resulting directly from such use 
comparable market valuations of businesses similar to aramark s business segments 
industry specific economic conditions 
competitor activities and regulatory initiatives 
client and customer preferences and behavior patterns 
we believe that an accounting estimate relating to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to change from time to time and the recognition of an impairment could have a significant impact on our income statement 
environmental loss contingencies accruals for environmental loss contingencies ie  environmental reserves are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can reasonably be estimated 
management views the measurement of environmental reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the considerable uncertainty surrounding estimation  including the need to forecast well into the future 
we are involved in legal proceedings under state  federal and local environmental laws in connection with operations of our uniform rental segment or businesses conducted by our predecessors or companies that we have acquired 
the calculation of environmental reserves is based on the evaluation of currently available information  prior experience in the remediation of contaminated sites and assumptions with respect to government regulations and enforcement activity  changes in remediation technology and practices  and financial obligations and credit worthiness of other responsible parties and insurers 
litigation and claims the company is a party to various legal actions and investigations including  among others  employment matters  compliance with government regulations  including import and export controls and customs laws  federal and state employment laws  including wage and hour laws  contractual disputes and other matters  including matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
these claims may be brought by  among others  the government  clients  customers and employees 
management considers the measurement of litigation reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the significant uncertainty in some cases relating to the outcome of potential claims or litigation and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from litigation or other claims 
in determining legal reserves  management considers  among other issues interpretation of contractual rights and obligations 
the status of government regulatory initiatives  interpretations and investigations 
the status of settlement negotiations 
prior experience with similar types of claims 
whether there is available insurance 
advice of counsel 
allowance for doubtful accounts we encounter risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
we record a provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate provision  management analyzes the creditworthiness of specific customers and the aging of customer balances 
management also considers general and specific industry economic conditions  industry concentration and contractual rights and obligations 
management believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from time to time and uncollectible accounts could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations 
inventory obsolescence we record an inventory obsolescence reserve for obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory  principally in the uniform and career apparel segments 
in calculating our inventory obsolescence reserve  management analyzes historical data regarding customer demand within specific product categories and makes assumptions regarding economic conditions within customer specific industries  as well as style and product changes 
management believes that its accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because customer demand in certain of our businesses can be variable and changes in our reserve for inventory obsolescence could materially affect our financial results 
critical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant  and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require revision 
results of continuing operations on may   the company completed the sale of its educational resources segment see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  the fiscal and operating results for this business are reported as discontinued operations

excluding these three items for comparison purposes  operating income increased in further  excluding the impact of acquisitions  foreign currency translation  the estimated effect of the rd week in and the effect of the calendar shift on the education sector  operating income increased over the prior year  as higher income in the us food and support and uniform rental segments was largely offset by reduced income from the international and direct marketing segments 
consolidated operating income margin  excluding the above three items was in and in while the margin in the us food and support segment was even with last year and the uniform rental margin increased slightly  reduced operating income in the international and direct marketing segments resulted in a decrease in consolidated margin 
interest and other financing costs  net  decreased compared to the prior year  due primarily to the debt extinguishment loss recorded in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements and the impact of lower average borrowing levels and lower interest rates in fiscal the effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in in  a favorable adjustment  resulting from the closing of certain open tax years  reduced the effective rate by

segment results the following tables present a comparison of segment sales and operating income together with the amount of and percentage change between periods 
fiscal change dollars in millions sales by segment food and support services united states food and support services international uniform and career apparel rental uniform and career apparel direct marketing fiscal change dollars in millions operating income by segment food and support services united states food and support services international uniform and career apparel rental uniform and career apparel direct marketing corporate other income expense n m food and support services united states segment food and support services united states segment sales for fiscal increased over the prior year 
fiscal was a week year which included one additional week of operations and resulted in fiscal starting one week later than normal  causing a lack of service day comparability in the education sector 
adjusting for the rd week and the effect of the fiscal calendar shift  sales increased approximately  due to acquisitions approximately  increased volume approximately and net new accounts approximately 
sales increased in all of our business sectors on a comparable week week basis 
business services sector sales growth was in the mid single digits driven by a balance of base business growth and net new business 
base business growth resulted in high single digit sales growth in the education sector 
the facilities sector reported low double digit sales growth resulting from both net new accounts and base business growth 
the healthcare corrections sector reported low double digit sales growth due to base business growth and net new accounts 
sales in the sports entertainment sector grew in the high single digits attributable to acquisitions  base business growth and net new accounts 
segment operating income decreased compared to the prior year  which included results of the extra fiscal week and approximately million of insurance proceeds from the september th claim 
excluding these two items from fiscal  operating income increased approximately of which approximately was contributed by acquisitions 
fiscal segment operating income was influenced by a number of factors 
the positive effect of base business and new account sales growth was constrained as a result of start up transition costs at new healthcare accounts  increased healthcare clinical service labor and material costs  higher labor related expenses including workers compensation  state unemployment insurance and healthcare costs  and somewhat higher food costs  particularly at education accounts 
broadly affecting year over year comparisons  improved operating performance in the sports entertainment sector was substantially offset by lower operating income in the facilities sector 
the fourth quarter settlement of the school support services civil litigation see note to the financial statements resulted in a favorable accrual adjustment of approximately million 
food and support services international segment sales in the food and support services international segment increased compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the rd week impact from  sales increased due to acquisitions approximately  increased volume approximately and net new business approximately 
spain and canada reported high single to low double digit sales growth  while growth in germany and the uk was in the low single digits  reflecting modest gains in base and net new business 
fiscal segment operating income increased 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and the estimated rd week impact  operating income decreased compared to the prior year 
further  excluding acquisitions  operating income decreased approximately in increased operating income in germany and spain was more than offset by the decrease in uk operating results 
uk results were negatively affected by a number of factors  including losses from certain offshore oil services operations approximately million and several fourth quarter accounting adjustments approximately million 
the accounting adjustments included write offs of amounts previously recorded as due from vendor programs  and a reserve for possible obligations under client contracts 
management has begun improvement initiatives in these areas  which will continue into fiscal fiscal includes currency transaction gains of approximately million 
uniform and career apparel rental segment uniform and career apparel rental segment fiscal sales increased compared to the prior year 
adjusting for the estimated effect of the rd week in fiscal  sales growth was approximately  with acquisitions contributing about 
the expanded sales force and slight improvement in employment levels resulted in increased net new sales and a slowing of the volume reduction at existing accounts 
price increases also contributed approximately to the growth 
fiscal segment operating income increased compared to the prior year 
net new sales growth  price increases  and lower garment costs resulting from expanded self manufacturing activity drove the income increase 
improvement was constrained by the continuing high cost of fuel  increases in labor related expenses and the cost of expanding the sales force 
uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment sales in decreased compared to the prior year 
adjusting for the effect of the rd week in  sales were about even to the prior year 
comparable week sales in the fourth quarter of decreased approximately from the prior year quarter  as sales of safety products were negatively affected by the ongoing department of commerce investigation involving certain export sales at galls 
while export sales are not significant  the investigation has had a dampening effect on demand from government agencies see legal proceedings 
segment operating income decreased approximately compared to the prior year 
reduced margin attributable to the decrease in sales of safety products and costs associated with the investigation were the principal causes of the decrease 
wearguard crest results were also negatively effected as a result of a customer mix shift to lower margin products and the effects of starting up a new national account program 
we expect the difficult conditions encountered in this segment to continue into fiscal corporate corporate expenses  those administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase was due principally to the million pre tax charge in related to the resignation of the company s former chief executive officer announced in september outlook although recent us employment statistics and general economic indicators have shown improvement  we anticipate the recovery impact on our business will be gradual and moderate for at least the first half of fiscal in our domestic food and uniform operations  continuing start up costs at certain new healthcare accounts and ongoing cost pressures  particularly labor related and energy costs  are expected to have a constraining effect on operating margins 
in addition  we expect that the current national hockey league lockout will have a negative effect on the first and second quarters of fiscal the ongoing investigation at galls and the effects of the new national program roll out at wearguard crest are also likely to negatively affect the direct marketing segment in fiscal finally  while we expect the results of our international segment to improve throughout  the effects of recent management initiatives in the uk business may not be fully evident until the latter part of fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated overview sales for fiscal were billion  an increase of over fiscal  with the rd week in fiscal contributing approximately to the increase 
double digit sales increases were achieved in the food and support services segments

operating income for fiscal was million  an increase of from the prior year 
fiscal operating income includes million of business interruption insurance proceeds  received in the fourth quarter  representing the final settlement of our september  claim see note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal also includes a charge of million to reduce an investment in a previously divested periodicals distribution business to its estimated recoverable value  and fiscal includes a million net gain  resulting principally from the sale of our ownership interests in the boston red sox entities and a residual investment in a previously divested business  both of which are presented as other income expense  net see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding other income expense and the insurance proceeds  operating income increased compared to the prior year 
further  excluding the impact of acquisitions  foreign currency translation and the estimated effect of the rd week  operating income increased over the prior year 
the sales and operating income of certain of our businesses continued to be adversely affected by weak economic conditions throughout fiscal  particularly continued low levels of employment and reduced visitations at national parks 
consolidated operating income margin  excluding the insurance proceeds and other income expense  was in fiscal compared to in fiscal due to the fine host post acquisition operating losses  the impact of depressed economic conditions on the uniform rental segment  decreased visitations at national parks in the sports and entertainment sector  offset by increased synergies from the servicemaster acquisition 
interest and other financing costs  net increased compared to the prior year  due primarily to the debt extinguishment loss see note to the consolidated financial statements and the impact of higher average borrowing levels  partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to in fiscal fiscal included a favorable adjustment for the settlement of open tax years  and the effective rate was favorably affected by other income in fiscal income from continuing operations for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal fiscal income from continuing operations includes other expense million net of tax  the fourth quarter insurance proceeds million net of tax  the debt extinguishment loss million net of tax and the tax settlement adjustment million

the rd week in fiscal contributed approximately to the increase 
sales growth  excluding the impact of acquisitions and the rd week  was approximately 
sales growth in the education sector was in the high single digits  and the other sector which includes correctional and healthcare clients  experienced sales growth in the low double digits due primarily to increased volume at existing accounts 
the business services sector continued to be negatively affected by the weak economy  particularly weak employment levels 
while the economy has shown recent signs of recovery  we have not yet seen a meaningful increase in employment in the categories most important to this sector 
fiscal sales in this sector  excluding acquisitions  declined about from the prior year  an improvement over the prior year decline of 
sales in the sports and entertainment sector increased in the high single digits compared to the prior year  with sales increases due to new locations  higher attendance at mlb games and an increased number of nhl and nba games  being partially offset by a decline in visitations at national parks 
the facilities services sector sales growth excluding acquisitions was in the low single digits for the year  but improved to the high single digits in the fourth quarter of fiscal segment operating income increased compared to the prior year  with the million fourth quarter insurance proceeds and acquisitions contributing approximately and  respectively 
we also estimate the fiscal rd week contributed to operating income growth based on the seasonality of certain of our businesses 
strong performance in the education and other sectors and continued realization of synergies from the servicemaster acquisition were partially offset by significantly reduced profitability in the sports and entertainment sector due to decreased visitations at national parks  and the fine host post acquisition operating loss 
food and support services international segment sales in the food and support services international segment increased compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  sales increased due to acquisitions approximately  increased volume approximately and net new business approximately 
spain achieved low double digit sales growth  while sales growth in the united kingdom was in the high single digits 
sales in germany increased marginally over the prior year  reflective of the continuing weakness in the german economy 
fiscal segment operating income increased

base business growth of was driven by solid performances in germany  canada and spain  while earnings in the united kingdom were approximately equal with the prior year 
our client interest contracts which are described in the business section of this annual report provide that client billings  and for some contracts the sharing of profits and losses  are based on our determinations of costs of service for these contracts 
based on a recent internal review of certain client interest contracts in our international segment  we are working to clarify or adjust certain contractual arrangements 
fourth quarter operating results have been adjusted to reflect the possible effect of this effort 
see risk factors our business is contract intensive and may lead to client disputes 
uniform and career apparel rental segment uniform and career apparel rental segment fiscal sales increased compared to the prior year due to the impact of acquisitions and the rd week in sales increases from net new business have been offset by reduced volume at existing accounts 
sales growth in this segment continues to be significantly constrained by depressed employment levels  particularly in the manufacturing  automotive and airline sectors 
fiscal segment operating income  including the rd week  decreased compared to the prior fiscal year 
net new sales growth and modest price increases were substantially offset by contraction in the base business  and while cost control and operational improvement initiatives mitigated to a large extent normal operating cost increases  increased medical and fuel costs and a very competitive business environment put continued downward pressure on margins compared to the prior year 
uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment uniform and career apparel direct marketing segment sales in increased compared to the prior year 
excluding the impact of an acquisition  segment sales were about equal to the prior year  with increased sales of safety products offset by decreased sales of work clothing where sales continue to be constrained by sluggish economic conditions 
segment operating income for fiscal increased compared to the prior year as a result of the acquisition  the seasonably significant rd week in and continued margin improvement due to apparel product cost reductions 
corporate corporate expenses  those administrative expenses not allocated to the business segments  were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due principally to a gain of million from a residual payment related to a previously divested entity 
increases in insurance and other costs were largely offset by the absence in fiscal of certain ipo related costs incurred in the prior year 
results of discontinued operations as discussed above  on may   the company closed the sale of its educational resources business to knowledge universe corporation for million in cash  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
the proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings and the sale resulted in a net gain of million 
the results of this business are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
sales  operating income and income from discontinued operations for fiscal excluding the net gain through the transaction closing date and for fiscal and fiscal are as follows fiscal in millions sales income before income taxes income from discontinued operations financial condition and liquidity reference to the consolidated statements of cash flows will facilitate understanding of the discussion that follows 
those statements reflect the educational resources business as a discontinued operation 
fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the principal components in millions of the net decrease were decrease in income from continuing operations net increase in non cash charges depreciation  amortization  deferred taxes  etc 
working capital changes reduction in non current liabilities  principally insurance payments the increase in working capital was due principally to an increase in inventory approximately million and certain lower current liabilities approximately million  specifically accrued commissions payable to clients and accrued income taxes 
the inventory change reflects higher inventory levels in both the uniform rental and direct marketing segments driven by new products and a higher level of activity in the rental business  and new customer programs in the direct marketing business 
lower accrued client commissions in the sports and entertainment business are due principally to the interplay of the fiscal calendar cut off and the timing of major league baseball games 
the amount and timing of income tax payments principally federal  determined in part by the amount of the stock option deduction and other book tax timing differences  resulted in a lower current income liability at year end total debt increased by million primarily due to the cost of acquisitions and the share buyback program

our profitability could be adversely affected if we were faced with cost increases for food  wages  other labor related expenses including workers compensation  state unemployment insurance and healthcare costs  insurance  fuel  utilities  piece goods  clothing and equipment  especially to the extent we were unable to recover such increased costs through increases in the prices for our services  due to general economic conditions  competitive conditions  or both 
for example  substantial increases in the cost of fuel and utilities have historically resulted in substantial cost increases in our uniform services business  and to a lesser extent in our food and support services segment 
in addition  approximately of our food and support services sales are from profit and loss contracts under which we have limited ability to pass on cost increases to our clients 
our business may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if labor costs increase 
in the past  the united states has periodically experienced reduced levels of unemployment  which has created a shortage of qualified workers at all levels 
given that our workforce requires large numbers of entry level and skilled workers and managers  low levels of unemployment can compromise our ability in certain of our businesses to continue to provide quality service or compete for new business 
from time to time  we have had difficulty in hiring and maintaining qualified management personnel  particularly at the entry management level 
we will continue to have significant requirements to hire such personnel 
our success also depends to a substantial extent on the ability  experience and performance of our management  particularly our chairman and chief executive officer  joseph neubauer 
we also regularly hire a large number of part time workers  particularly in our food and support services segments 
any difficulty we may encounter in hiring such workers could result in significant increases in labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition for labor has resulted in wage increases in the past and future competition could substantially increase our labor costs 
due to the labor intensive nature of our businesses and the fact that of our food and support services segment s sales are from profit loss contracts under which we have limited ability to pass along cost increases  a shortage of labor or increases in wage levels in excess of normal levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our expansion strategy involves risks 
we may seek to acquire companies or enter into joint ventures that complement our business  and our inability to complete acquisitions  integrate acquired companies successfully or enter into joint ventures may render us less competitive 
we may be evaluating acquisitions or engage in acquisition negotiations at any given time 
for example  in we acquired catering alliance  a contract caterer in the united kingdom  and of bright china services industries  a facilities services company in china 
we also increased our investment in central restaurantes  our chilean joint venture  to percent 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to identify acquisition candidates or joint venture partners on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we make additional acquisitions  we also cannot be sure that any benefits anticipated from the acquisitions will actually be realized 
likewise  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary financing for acquisitions 
such financing could be restricted by the terms of our debt agreements or it could be more expensive than our current debt 
the amount of such debt financing for acquisitions could be significant and the terms of such debt instruments could be more restrictive than our current covenants 
in addition  our ability to control the planning and operations of our joint ventures and other less than majority owned affiliates may be subject to numerous restrictions imposed by the joint venture agreements and majority shareholders 
our joint venture partners may also have interests which differ from ours 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in operating  contract and supply chain difficulties  such as the failure to retain clients or management personnel and problems coordinating technology and supply chain arrangements 
also  in connection with any acquisition  we could fail to discover liabilities of the acquired company for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator in spite of any investigation we make prior to the acquisition 
in addition  labor laws in certain countries may require us to retain more employees than would otherwise be optimal from entities we acquire 
such difficulties may divert significant financial  operational and managerial resources from our existing operations  and make it more difficult to achieve our operating and strategic objectives 
the diversion of management attention  particularly in a difficult operating environment  may affect our sales 
possible future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense  contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets  which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results and or cash flow  or in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock 
if we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations  we could become subject to lawsuits and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business 
we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal  state  national  provincial and local level in many areas of our business  such as food safety and sanitation  the sale of alcoholic beverages  environmental issues  the import and export of goods and the services we provide in connection with governmentally funded entitlement programs 
while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws  regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations 
for example  on july   agents of the department of commerce  among others  executed a search warrant at the lexington  kentucky facilities of galls  a division of the company  to gather records in connection with record keeping and documentation of certain export sales 
the investigation surrounds the possible failure to obtain proper export licenses or prepare accurate shipping declarations in connection with the export of galls products 
see item legal proceedings 
in addition  from time to time  both federal and state governmental agencies have conducted audits of our billing practices as part of investigations of providers of services under governmental contracts  or otherwise 
like others in our business  we receive requests for information from governmental agencies in connection with these audits 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to criminal sanctions or civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  seizures or debarment from government contracts 
the cost of compliance or the consequences of non compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require either the corporation as a whole or individual businesses to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations 
changes in or new interpretations of the governmental regulatory framework may affect our contract terms and may reduce our sales or profits 
a portion of our sales  estimated to be approximately in fiscal  is derived from business with us federal  state and local governments and agencies 
changes or new interpretations in  or changes in the enforcement of  the statutory or regulatory framework applicable to services provided under governmental contracts or bidding procedures  particularly by our food and support services businesses  could result in fewer new contracts or contract renewals  modifications to the methods we apply to price government contracts  or in contract terms of shorter duration than we have historically experienced  any of which could result in lower sales or profits than we have historically achieved  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our failure to retain our current clients and renew our existing client contracts could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to retain our current clients and renew our existing client contracts 
our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors  including the quality  price and responsiveness of our services  as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew existing client contracts at the same or higher rates or that our current clients will not turn to competitors  cease operations  elect to self operate or terminate contracts with us 
the failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be adversely affected if customers reduce their outsourcing or use of preferred vendors 
our business and growth strategies depend in large part on the continuation of a current trend toward outsourcing services 
customers will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide higher quality services at a lower overall cost and permit them to focus on their core business activities 
we cannot be certain that this trend will continue or not be reversed or that customers that have outsourced functions will not decide to perform these functions themselves 
in addition  labor unions representing employees of some of our current and prospective customers have occasionally opposed the outsourcing trend to the extent that they believed that current union jobs for their memberships might be lost 
in these cases  unions typically seek to ensure that jobs that are outsourced continue to be unionized and thus  the unions seek to direct to union employees the performance of the types of services we offer 
we have also identified a trend among some of our customers toward the retention of a limited number of preferred vendors to provide all or a large part of their required services 
we cannot be certain that this trend will continue or not be reversed or  if it does continue  that we will be selected and retained as a preferred vendor to provide these services 
adverse developments with respect to either of these trends could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our international business results are influenced by currency fluctuations and other risks that could have an effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our sales is derived from international markets 
during fiscal  approximately of our sales were generated outside the united states 
we have a presence in countries outside of the united states with approximately  personnel 
the operating results of our international subsidiaries are translated into us dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
our international operations are also subject to other risks  including the requirement to comply with changing and conflicting national and local regulatory requirements  potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes  managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations  credit risk or financial condition of local customers  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  foreign exchange controls  and local political and social conditions 
there can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to continue to develop our business in emerging markets over the long term 
emerging market operations present several additional risks  including greater fluctuation in currencies relative to the us dollar  economic and governmental instability  civil disturbances  volatility in gross domestic production  foreign corrupt practice act compliance issues and nationalization and expropriation of private assets 
our operations are seasonal and quarter to quarter comparisons may not be a good indicator of our performance 
in the first and second fiscal quarters  within the food and support services united states segment  there historically has been a lower level of sales at the historically higher margin sports  entertainment and recreational food service operations  which is partly offset by increased activity in the educational sector 
in the third and fourth fiscal quarters  there historically has been a significant increase in sales at sports  entertainment and recreational accounts  which is partially offset by the effect of summer recess in the educational sector 
the sales of wearguard  one of our direct marketing companies  generally increase during the first quarter of the fiscal year because of the onset of colder weather in the northern tier of the united states as well as the gift giving holidays 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or how we will perform in the future 
our indebtedness may restrict certain growth opportunities 
as of october   we had approximately billion of outstanding indebtedness 
the size of our indebtedness may restrict the pursuit of certain new business opportunities 
we will also have to use a portion of our cash flow to service our debt  which may prevent us from pursuing certain new business opportunities and certain acquisitions 
if we were to incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in the future  the agreements relating to such indebtedness may include covenants more restrictive than our current debt agreements 
failure to satisfy financial and other covenants or make required debt payments could cause us to violate the terms of our credit facility agreements and thereby result in the exercise of remedies by our lenders  including acceleration of our indebtedness  impair our liquidity and limit our ability to raise additional capital 
attempts to further unionize our workforce  if successful  could increase our costs 
approximately  employees in our domestic operations are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
certain unions representing employees in our domestic food and support services segment recently have stated that they intend to begin a union campaign targeting the major companies in our industry 
we have always respected our employees right to unionize or not to unionize 
however  the unionization of a greater portion of our workforce could increase our overall costs at the affected locations and adversely affect our flexibility to run our business in the most efficient manner to remain competitive 
in addition  if we were to become subject to work stoppages  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
food and support services competition in our industry could adversely affect our results of operations 
there is significant competition in the food and support services business from local  regional  national and international companies  of varying sizes  many of which have substantial financial resources 
our ability to successfully compete depends on our ability to provide quality services at a reasonable price and to provide value to our customers 
certain of our competitors have been and may in the future be willing to underbid us or accept a lower profit margin or expend more capital in order to obtain or retain business 
also  certain regional and local service providers may be better established than we are within a specific geographic region 
in addition  existing or potential clients may elect to self operate their food service  eliminating the opportunity for us to serve them or compete for the account 
while we have a significant international presence  should business sector clients require multi national bidding  we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage because we may not be able to offer services in as many countries as some of our competitors 
sales of sports  entertainment and recreational services would be adversely affected by a decline in attendance at client facilities or by a reduction or cessation of events 
the portion of our food and support services business which provides services in public facilities such as stadiums  arenas  amphitheaters  convention centers and tourist and recreational attractions is sensitive to an economic downturn  as expenditures to attend sporting events or concerts  take vacations  or hold or attend conventions are funded to a partial or total extent by discretionary income 
a decrease in such discretionary income on the part of potential attendees at events in our clients facilities could result in a reduction in our sales 
further  because our exposure to the ultimate consumer of what we provide is limited by our dependence on our clients to attract customers to their facilities and events  our ability to respond to such a reduction in attendance  and therefore our sales  is limited 
there are many factors that could reduce the numbers of events in a facility or attendance at an event  including labor disruptions involving sports leagues  poor performance by the teams playing in a facility and inclement weather  which would adversely affect sales and profits 
for example  during fiscal  reduced visitation at certain of our national park service venues adversely affected our sales and operating income 
in addition  the national hockey league collective bargaining agreement expired in september and the national hockey league nhl and the nhl players association have failed to agree on the terms of a new collective bargaining agreement 
on september   the owners of the nhl teams locked out the nhl players 
a shortened or cancelled season would result in a loss of sales and reduced profits at the national hockey league venues we service 
the pricing and cancellation terms of our food and support services contracts may constrain our ability to recover costs and to make a profit on our contracts 
the amount of risk that we bear and our profit potential vary depending on the type of contract under which we provide food and support services 
we may be unable to fully recover costs on contracts that limit our ability to increase prices 
in addition  we provide many of our services under contracts of indefinite term  which are subject to termination on short notice by either party without cause 
some of our profit and loss contracts contain minimum guaranteed remittances to our client regardless of our sales or profit at the facility involved 
if sales do not exceed costs under a contract which contains minimum guaranteed commissions  we will bear any losses which are incurred  as well as the guaranteed commission 
generally  our contracts limit our ability to raise prices on the food  beverages and merchandise we sell within a particular facility without the client s consent 
in addition  some of our contracts exclude certain events or products from the scope of the contract  or give the client the right to modify the terms under which we may operate at certain events 
the refusal by individual clients to permit the sale of some products at their venues  or the imposition by clients of limits on prices which are not economically feasible for us  could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
our business is contract intensive and may lead to client disputes 
our business is contract intensive and we are parties to many contracts with clients all over the world 
our client interest contracts which are described in the business section of this annual report  provide that client billings  and for some contracts the sharing of profits and losses  are based on our determinations of costs of service 
contract terms under which we base these determinations may be subject to differing interpretations which could result in disputes with our clients from time to time 
clients generally have the right to audit our contracts  and we periodically review our compliance with contract terms and provisions 
if clients were to dispute our contract determinations  the resolution of such disputes in a manner adverse to aramark s interests could negatively affect sales and operating results 
while we do not believe any reviews  audits or other such matters would result in material adjustments  if a large number of our client arrangements were modified in response to any such matter  the effect could be materially adverse to our business or results of operations 
claims of illness or injury associated with the service of food and beverage to the public could adversely affect us 
claims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry  and a number of these claims may exist at any given time 
as a result  we could be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from food quality or handling claims at one or more of the facilities that we serve 
in addition to decreasing our sales and profitability at our facilities  adverse publicity could negatively impact our service reputation  hindering our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms or to obtain new business 
in addition  future food product recalls and health concerns may from time to time disrupt our business 
in fiscal  one distributor provided approximately of our food and non food products in the us and canada  and if our relationship or their business were to be disrupted  we could experience disruptions to our operations and cost structure in such countries 
if our relationship with  or the business of  sysco  our main us distributor of our food and non food products were to be disrupted  we would have to arrange alternative distributors and our operations and cost structure could be adversely affected in the short term 
similarly  a sudden termination of the relationship with a significant provider in other geographic areas could in the short term adversely affect our ability to provide services and disrupt our customer relationships in such areas 
governmental regulations may subject us to significant liability 
our operations are subject to various governmental regulations  including those governing the service of food and alcoholic beverages  minimum wage and employment  wage and hour laws  governmentally funded entitlement programs  environmental protection  human health and safety  customs  import and export control laws  and federal motor carrier safety 
the regulations relating to each of our food and support service sectors are many and complex 
a variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling  preparation and serving of food including in some cases requirements relating to the temperature of food  and the cleanliness of food production facilities and the hygiene of food handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level 
we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations 
furthermore  additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance 
we serve alcoholic beverages at many facilities  and must comply with applicable licensing laws  as well as state and local service laws  commonly called dram shop statutes 
dram shop statutes generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as an individual who is intoxicated or a minor 
if we violate dram shop laws  we may be liable to third parties for the acts of the patron 
although we sponsor regular training programs designed to minimize the likelihood of such a situation  we cannot guarantee that intoxicated or minor patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us 
there can be no assurance that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance 
we must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the states in which we serve alcoholic beverages 
some of our contracts require us to pay liquidated damages during any period in which our liquor license for the facility is suspended  and most contracts are subject to termination if we lose our liquor license for the facility 
uniform and career apparel competition in the uniform rental industry could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have a number of major national competitors in the uniform rental industry with significant financial resources 
in addition  there are regional and local uniform suppliers whom we believe may have strong customer loyalty 
while most customers focus primarily on quality of service  uniform rental also is a price sensitive service and if existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices  we may be required to lower prices  which would reduce our sales and profits 
the uniform rental business requires investment capital for growth 
failure to maintain capital investment in this segment would put us at a competitive disadvantage 
environmental regulations may subject us to significant liability and limit our ability to grow 
our uniform rental segment is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations  including the federal clean water act  clean air act  resource conservation and recovery act  comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act and similar state statutes and regulations 
in particular  we use and must dispose of wastewater containing detergent and other residues from the laundering of garments and other merchandise through publicly operated treatment works or sewer systems and are subject to volume and chemical discharge limits and penalties and fines for non compliance 
in the course of our business  we settle  or contribute to the settlement of  actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials 
we may have to expend material amounts to rectify the consequences of any such disposal in the future 
under environmental laws  as an owner or operator of real estate we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in or emanating from our owned  leased or operated property  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
liability may be imposed upon us without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurances that locations which we own  lease or otherwise operate or which we may acquire in the future have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third party actions such as tort suits 
in addition  such regulations may limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded plants 
in connection with our operations and the operations of our predecessors or companies that we have acquired  hazardous or toxic substances may migrate from properties on which we operate or which were operated by our predecessors or companies we acquired to other properties 
we may be subject to significant liabilities to the extent that human health is damaged or the value of such properties is diminished by such migration 
economic and business conditions affecting our customer base could negatively impact our sales and operating results 
we supply uniform services to the airline  hospitality  retail and manufacturing industries  among others  all of which have been subject to one or more of shifting employment levels  changes in worker productivity  uncertainty regarding the impacts of rehiring and a shift to offshore manufacturing 
economic hardship among our client base could cause some of our clients to restrict expenditures or even cease to conduct business  both of which could negatively affect our sales and operating results
