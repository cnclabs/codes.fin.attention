table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
actual results may differ materially due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the section entitled forward looking information and factors that may affect future results and in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview of the year s activities as a leading designer  producer and marketer of brand name personal care products  we are constantly searching for new avenues of sales growth 
we use product innovation to enhance the versatility  speed  and convenience of our appliances  enabling us to keep our product offerings fresh and exciting to our consumers 
our business over the last year was characterized by the following changes in our business and the market place in which we operate electronic curling irons  thermal brushes  hair straighteners  and hair crimpers 
the curling iron category is a cyclical style driven business 
industry trade estimates place the total market dollar volume growth for this category at approximately percent over the last three years 
we continue to add life to this category and additional margin through higher price points by offering numerous performance updates including ceramic elements  higher wattages and pulse heat  and variable rheostat controls for faster heat up and more precise heat applications 
high powered hot air thermal brushes which combine curling brush and hair dryer in one appliance were a top seller in this category 
ceramic hair straighteners continue to grow as an industry category as the straight hair  sleek with a shine look has gained prominence in the fashion and entertainment industries 
specialty crimpers and wavers have also shown signs of growth 
over the year  we showed gains in market share in this group 
revlon  sunbeam  vidal sassoon  hot tools  wigo  and wave rage were key brands in this group 
hair dryers 
hair dryers that offer consumers styling versatility continue to be an important product category in our business 
the category is subject to aggressive price competition at entry level price points 
the retail market for this group  while still the largest of our product categories has been decreasing 
industry trade estimates place the total market volume growth as trending down approximately percent over the last three years 
innovation has helped us to thrive in this category and perform against the general trend 
we were the first to market with ionic hair dryers 
ionic dryers dry rapidly while leaving hair softer and shinier compared with standard dryers 
we have extended our price points  increased volume and broadened the appeal of this category by including nice value added touches such as volumizers  hair pik  and concentrator attachments which allow for more precision styling 
additionally  professional styles with more powerful ac motors and heavier duty cords and construction are gaining popularity with the retail consumer 
revlon  sunbeam  vidal sassoon  hot tools  wigo  and wave rage were key brands in this group 
electronic clippers and trimmers 
increasing popularity of facial hair has picked up the pace of growth in our clippers and trimmers business 
the focus of numerous infomercials on this product group has helped to fuel sales 
industry trade estimates place the total dollar volume market growth over the last three years at over percent with most of this growth occurring last year 
while we expect that overall market sales in this group will level out over the coming year  we are a relatively new entrant to the market  and expect to see continuing sales growth in our offerings for the category 
vidal sassoon and sunbeam were key brands in this group 

table of contents massagers and wellness products 
this category includes hand held massagers  cushion massagers  foot spas  home spa facial and manicure appliances  paraffin baths  and spa care gift sets 
the overall size of the massager and wellness market is about one half of the personal hair care market 
the massager market was trending down over the previous three years  driven by lower retail unit prices but showed new signs of life in calendar industry trade estimates place the total market growth overall as down approximately percent over the last three years  but overall dollar volumes were up percent in the latest calendar year with higher end cushioned and heated back and body massagers leading the growth 
another key trend is the health  fitness  and wellness movement which is being helped with the addition of technology to the group 
given the size of this market  we believe there are opportunities to leverage our core competencies of innovation and speed to market to create additional sales growth for helen of troy 
during fiscal  we embarked on a new product development initiative that resulted in a combined share growth for our wellness and massager brands of percent in our served market segments 
for fiscal and beyond  we plan to build on our successes by continuing to track the consumer and retail landscape to develop and offer unique and innovative solutions for our customers 
revlon and dr 
scholl s were key brands in this group 
grooming  skin care  and hair products 
we are a new entrant into this market 
in october of we formed idelle labs to revive and energize trusted brand names in our recently acquired men s grooming  skin care  and hair care portfolio 
we are focused on aggressively growing the vitalis  sea breeze  ammens  condition in  final net  and vitapointe product franchises 
our key strategies are to bring growth to these brands through increased investment in consumer advertising and customer promotion 
focusing in the near term on launching complementary  innovative extensions  we are also developing new product lines based on our consumer insights 
these brands are contributing positive sales growth momentum to our family of products 
during september of  we also acquired the rights to produce and distribute the brut men s grooming product line throughout the western hemisphere 
fiscal operations contain five months of brut sales 
brushes  combs  and accessories 
this very traditional category of our business was down percent in total dollar volume in fiscal with the trend towards straighter  cleaner hair styles  the accessory business has suffered 
in order to combat the general trend in this market  we are looking to new technologies such as ceramic brushes  ionic brushes and ion ceramic brushes to capitalize on grooming trends 
if successful  these will not only bring back volume  but we believe will allow us to sell at higher price points 
vidal sassoon product packaging is also being refreshed for greater eye appeal and ease of consumer shopping 
finally  an expanded broad advertising program from a key licensor  revlon will benefit brand awareness for our revlon grooming products in fiscal hairsetters 
this is an older technology that tends to be cyclical and is not seeing much current consumer emphasis due to fashion trending toward straighter hair 
retailers continue to de emphasize this category to make display space for newer more exciting hair styling products 
in fiscal  our business in this group continued to trend down 
revlon  vidal sassoon  and wave rage were key brands in this group 
in addition to the above activities  we continued to pursue the following activities to strengthen our business  and lay the foundation for significant future growth  both organically and through acquisition we continued with the development and implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system 
in connection with this  we have devoted a significant amount of our staff s time to re thinking 
table of contents every aspect of how we transact business 
through the end of fiscal  we had spent approximately  on this project 
we plan to go live on the new system during fiscal we completed the integration of ammens  brut  condition in  final net  sea breeze  vitalis  and vitapointe brands into our operations  and we believe we are now positioned to expand the sales of these products 
at the end of september   as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  we entered into a new  unsecured revolving credit facility to facilitate our short term borrowings and issuances of letters of credit 
we immediately used  of this credit facility and available cash to fund the acquisition of the brut family of products from unilever nv 
by year end of fiscal  we repaid these borrowings from cash generated from operations 
we reached an agreement to become the title sponsor of the sun bowl for the next three years starting with the december game 
the sun bowl is one of the longest running invitational post season college football games in the united states with a history that spans over years 
we have chosen the vitalis sun bowl to be the official name of this event which will be broadcast to a nationwide audience by cbs 
in addition to being of great benefit to the community where we are headquartered  we believe the vitalis sun bowl will provide us the opportunity to showcase the vitalis brand to a whole new generation of users 
we continued to invest and expand our presence internationally 
overall  our international sales grew percent in fiscal due to continued growth in europe  we had outgrown our existing sales and administrative facilities in great britain 
early in fiscal  we invested approximately  to open a new  square foot office facility in sheffield  england 
great britain serves as the base of operations for our european business and oversees our operations in germany and france 
in connection with our brut acquisition  we expanded our latin america activity 
in  we opened a mexico city office which will serve as our base of operations for latin america 
we now have a sales presence in the following countries the united states  canada  great britain  france  germany  china  greece  australia  mexico  brazil  venezuela  panama  chile  cost rica  peru  trinidad tobago  the dominican republic  guatemala  and el salvador 
in order to continue to expand our global market for personal care products under the revlon trade name  we amended our trademark licensing agreements with revlon consumer products corporation  to expand our revlon brand name geographic coverage in north america to include mexico for appliances  spa products  brushes  and hair accessories 
the new agreements also allow for the sale of fashion hair care accessories on a worldwide basis except for western europe 
as part of the new agreement  we prepaid  for calendar years and minimum royalties at a fifteen percent per annum discount 
revlon  at its option can require us to prepay our minimum royalties by december   also at a fifteen percent per annum discount 
in the fourth quarter of  in connection with these amendments  we paid  as full payment of a license renewal fee on all revlon license agreements which commence january  and run for fifteen years 
additionally  we received two new year renewal options  which allow us to extend the life of the agreements for up to years 

table of contents other significant activities during fiscal we addressed and or concluded certain matters which had significant impact on our consolidated financial condition 
these are highlighted below as announced in october  we began evaluating strategic alternatives for our investment in tactica international  inc tactica  with a view towards maximizing shareholder value 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we made the decision to exit our business activities with tactica  and have made reclassifications to reflect its activities as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal  in connection with the discontinued operations of tactica and the impairment of its goodwill  we recorded a total loss of  net of taxes 
on april  we completed the sale of tactica back to certain of its key operating manager shareholders 
in exchange for our percent ownership share of tactica and  of its secured debt and accrued interest  we received marketable securities  intellectual properties  and the right to certain tax refunds 
we do not expect a material gain or loss to arise from this sale transaction 
we expect to conclude all related exit activities by the end of the second fiscal quarter of this matter is more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements

gross profit margins gross profit  as a percentage of sales increased to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal in addition to a more favorable product mix from our north american and international operating segments  and the impact of higher gross margins on grooming  skin care  and hair products  we achieved declines in costs of goods sold due to better sourcing agreements and higher production volumes 
favorable currency exchange rates for the british pound and euro also helped improve margins in fiscal and fiscal almost all of our products are purchased in us dollars 
percent and percent of international sales were in british pounds or euros during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
selling  general  and administrative expense sg a sg a decreased to percent of sales in fiscal from percent in fiscal the percent decrease in sg a between fiscal and fiscal resulted from the continued decrease in royalty expense as a percentage of sales due to our renewing of royalty agreements on more favorable terms  the benefit of prepaying minimum royalties early  and an increase in sales for which we own the brand and thus do not incur royalty payments 
freight out costs continue to increase mostly due to higher fuel sur charges 
the increased transportation costs were offset by lower distribution costs as a result of opening our new southaven  mississippi warehouse in early fiscal sg a expenses decreased to percent of sales in fiscal from percent in fiscal two factors contributed to the percent decrease 
first  we experienced a  reduction in sg a due to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting 
table of contents standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
second  sg a dropped by  compared to fiscal because of foreign exchange gains

the international segment s operating income grew  for fiscal compared to fiscal  and  for fiscal compared to fiscal net sales growth and improved gross margins  as previously discussed were the significant contributing factors 
corporate other operating loss increased  for fiscal over fiscal this increase was attributable to  of executive compensation and  of community relations expenditures included in this line item in fiscal with shareholder approval  the executive compensation of mr 
rubin  the company s chief executive officer and president  was changed effective september  to provide mr 
rubin an increased incentive bonus opportunity 
also  effective september   mr 
rubin s employment agreement was amended to reduce his quarterly options grants 
interest expense and other income expense interest expense was  or percent  higher in fiscal than fiscal this is due to our draw of  under our revolving line of credit at the end of september to purchase the rights to produce and distribute brut product 
by fiscal year end we had repaid all borrowings against this loan 
interest expense was  or percent  lower in fiscal than in fiscal we did not borrow any funds under our line of credit during fiscal  as opposed to fiscal  when we borrowed funds during the first three quarters of that fiscal year and incurred the related interest expense 
during fiscal  our interest expense consisted entirely of interest on our fixed rate long term notes payable 
the increase of  or percent  in our other income for fiscal  over fiscal  was primarily due to the favorable settlement of two litigation matters  resulting in our recording  net of related legal costs  of other income 
this was partially offset by a drop in interest income of  for the year due to less investable cash and lower interest rates 

table of contents the increase of  or percent  in our other income for fiscal over fiscal  was due primarily to the fact that we had more cash available for investment during most of fiscal than fiscal income tax expense our fiscal income tax expense was percent of net income before taxes  a rate substantially lower than the percent rate that we experienced in fiscal the decline was due to more of our income in fiscal being taxed in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
our fiscal income tax expense of percent of net income before taxes  was higher than the percent rate that we experienced in fiscal the higher rate in fiscal over fiscal was a result of additional tax reserves set up in fiscal to provide for potential tax audit exposures and the comparative impact of the removal of a valuation allowance from a deferred tax asset during fiscal  thereby making that year s effective tax rate lower than it otherwise would have been 
discontinued operations as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  on october  we announced that we had begun evaluating strategic alternatives for our investment in tactica international  inc tactica  with a view towards maximizing shareholder value 
on april  we completed the sale of our percent interest in tactica back to certain shareholder operating managers 
in exchange for our percent share of tactica and  of its secured debt and accrued interest  we received marketable securities  intellectual properties  and the right to certain tax refunds 
we do not expect a material gain or loss to arise from this sale transaction 
tactica was sold because we believed it no longer fit into our business model 
we believe selling tactica was the most appropriate course of action to maximize our long term shareholder value 
the sale will free key corporate managers to concentrate their efforts on our remaining core operating divisions and to explore and integrate new business opportunities better suited to our long term objectives and operating system 
statement of financial accounting standards no

investing activities in fiscal  we acquired the brut brand from unilever nv with internally generated cash flow and  drawn against a revolving credit line and in fiscal we acquired six brands from the procter gamble company with internally generated cash flow 
these acquisitions resulted in the recording of inventory  capital equipment  trademarks  long term licenses  and goodwill 
in both years  we prepaid certain minimum royalties and licensing renewals in order to secure advantageous modifications of terms in our licensing agreements  and favorable payment discounts against our future royalty obligations 
in addition  over the past two years  we have made significant investments to position our corporate infrastructure for future growth opportunities 
in the latter half of fiscal and early fiscal  we completed the purchase and 
table of contents transition to a new warehouse facility in mississippi  which expanded our ability to serve our customer base in the midwest and eastern united states

in fiscal  we also spent  on transportation equipment 
financing activities during fiscal and fiscal  we funded our activities with internally generated cash flow 
while we borrowed from time to time against certain revolving credit facilities  all borrowings were short term and repaid within months of the initial advances 
our most significant short term borrowing was the draw of 
table of contents  of cash to initially fund our september  acquisition of the brut brand 
as of fiscal year end  we used internally generated operating cash flow to pay off this advance 
we are always looking for the most advantageous use for the cash we generate from operations 
during fiscal  we concluded that repurchase of our own stock on the open market would be beneficial to the long term interests of our shareholders 
during the second fiscal quarter of  our board of directors approved a resolution to purchase  in open market or through private transactions  up to  shares of our common stock 
during the year  we purchased and retired a total of  shares of our common stock on the open market at a total purchase price of  an additional  shares of common stock were tendered by a key shareholder and retired as payment and satisfaction of  of stock purchase price and federal income tax obligations arising from the exercise of  options by a key employee shareholder 
this transaction was valued at an average share price of using the average of the high bid and low bid prices for helen of troy stock as reported on the nasdaq national market system on the day the stock was tendered 
proceeds from employee option exercises and purchases through our employee stock purchase plan combined to provide  of cash and  in tax benefits in fiscal during fiscal and through october   we maintained a revolving line of credit with a bank providing for borrowings up to  accruing interest at the three month libor rate plus a percentage that varied based on the ratio of our debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda 
this facility was terminated on october  letters of credit issued and outstanding under this facility at the end of fiscal were approximately  we are currently arranging to transfer this letter of credit to our new lender  bank of america 
on september   certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new  unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america to facilitate short term borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit 
all borrowings accrue interest equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus percent or bank of america s prime rate 
alternatively  upon our timely election  borrowings accrue interest based on the respective    or month libor rate plus percent based upon the term of the borrowing 
the new credit facility allows for the issuance of letters of credit up to  outstanding letters of credit will reduce the  borrowing limit dollar for dollar 
the credit facility terminates in september as previously mentioned  we used  of this credit facility to fund the acquisition of the brut family of products from unilever nv 
as of the end of fiscal  no revolving loans or letters of credit were outstanding under this facility 
the bank of america credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain debt ebitda  fixed charge coverage ratios  and other customary covenants 
the agreement has been guaranteed  on a joint and several basis  by our parent company  helen of troy limited  and certain us subsidiaries 
as more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements  on april   we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets and liabilities of oxo international from wki holding company  inc banc of america securities  llc has been engaged to assist us in securing funding for this acquisition which will require an estimated  at closing and is expected to close sometime in our second fiscal quarter of we are currently negotiating the interest rates  maturities  and payment terms of various potential financing instruments associated with the acquisition

current and future capital needs based on our current financial condition and current operations  and subject to the satisfactory completion of our financing the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of oxo international from wki holding company  inc  we believe that cash flows from operations and available financing sources will continue to provide sufficient capital resources to fund the company s foreseeable short and long term liquidity requirements 
except for the oxo international transaction  we expect that our capital needs will stem primarily from the need to purchase sufficient levels of inventory and to carry normal levels of accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
in addition  we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities on a regular basis and may augment our internal growth with acquisitions of complementary businesses or product lines 
we may finance acquisition activity with available cash  the issuance of stock  or with additional debt  depending upon the size and nature of any such transaction and the status of the capital markets at the time of such acquisition 
acquisition of trade names and licenses on october   we acquired from the procter gamble company the right to sell products under six trade names 
we acquired all rights to the trademarks  formulas  and production processes for four of the six trade names ammens  vitalis  condition in  and final net 
the procter gamble company assigned to us its rights under licenses to sell products bearing the other two trade names  sea breeze and vitapointe 
the sea breeze license is perpetual 
the portion of the purchase price assigned to the four trademarks purchased is included in our consolidated balance sheet as of the end of fiscal and fiscal on the line entitled trademarks  net of accumulated amortization 
we have concluded that the useful economic lives of these trademarks are indefinite  meaning that they are not subject to amortization 
this conclusion was reached after consideration of the history of the brands and of our plans and forecasts for sales of products under these trademarks 
the portion of the purchase price assigned to the rights obtained under the sea breeze and vitapointe licenses appears on our consolidated balance sheets as of the end of fiscal 
table of contents and fiscal on the line entitled license agreements  at cost less accumulated amortization 
after consideration of the fact that the sea breeze license is perpetual and an analysis of the history of the brand as well as our plans and forecasts with respect to the brand  we determined that the sea breeze license has an indefinite economic useful life 
therefore it is not subject to amortization 
the vitapointe license expires on december  although  our long range expectation is to renew this license upon its expiration  we determined that the finite nature of this license indicates that it has a definite life and is  therefore subject to amortization in the annual amount of  non monetary transactions during fiscal  we entered into two non monetary transactions in which we exchanged inventory with a net book value of approximately  for advertising credits 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded both sales and cost of goods sold equal to the exchanged inventory s net book value 
we used approximately  and  of the advertising credits during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and expect to use substantially all remaining advertising credits during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the credits are valued at  and  on our consolidated balance sheets at the end of fiscal and  respectively  and are included in the line item entitled prepaid assets 

table of contents critical accounting policies the us securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we consider the following policies to meet this definition 
hong kong income taxes the inland revenue department the ird in hong kong assessed  us in tax on certain profits of our foreign subsidiaries for the fiscal years through in march of  the ird made an additional assessment of  us for fiscal year hong kong taxes income earned from certain activities conducted in hong kong 
we are vigorously defending our position that we conducted the activities that produced the profits in question outside of hong kong 
the company also asserts that it has complied with all applicable reporting and tax payment obligations 
in connection with the ird s tax assessment for the fiscal years through  we were required to purchase  us in tax reserve certificates in hong kong  which represented approximately percent of the liability assessed by the ird 
the company purchased additional tax reserve certificates in the amount of  us on april  as required by the ird 
tax reserve certificates represent the prepayment by a taxpayer of potential tax liabilities 
the amounts paid for tax reserve certificates are refundable in the event that the value of the tax reserve certificates exceeds the related tax liability 
these certificates are denominated in hong kong dollars and are subject to the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
if the ird s position were to prevail and if it were to assert the same position for years after fiscal  the resulting assessment could total  us for the period from fiscal through fiscal we vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to aggressively contest this matter through applicable taxing authority and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and involves unsettled areas of the law  based on currently available information  the company has provided for the best estimate of the probable tax liability for this matter 
while the resolution of the issue may result in tax liabilities which are significantly higher or lower than the reserves established for this matter  management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity 
however  an unfavorable resolution could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the quarter in which an adjustment is recorded or the tax is due or paid 
united states income taxes the irs is currently auditing the us federal tax returns of our largest us subsidiary for fiscal years   and the irs has provided notice of certain proposed adjustments to taxable income 
we vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustments and intend to aggressively contest this matter through applicable irs and judicial procedures  as appropriate 
although the final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and involves unsettled areas of the law  based on currently available information  we have provided for the best estimate of the probable tax liability for these matters 
while the resolution of the issue may result in tax liabilities which are significantly higher or lower than the reserves established for this matter  management currently believes that the resolution will not have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity 
however  an unfavorable resolution could have a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the quarter in which an adjustment is recorded or the tax is due or paid 
we plan to permanently reinvest all of the undistributed earnings of the non us subsidiaries of the non us subsidiaries 
we have made no provision for us federal income taxes on these undistributed earnings 
at february   undistributed earnings for which we had not provided deferred us federal income taxes totaled  
table of contents income tax provisions we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as changes occur in our assessments regarding our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision is increased in any period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of other complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts are unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
estimates of credits to be issued to customers we regularly receive requests for credits from retailers for returned products or in connection with sales incentives  such as cooperative advertising and volume rebate agreements 
we reduce sales or increase selling  general  and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the credits  for estimated future credits to customers 
our estimates of these amounts are based either on historical information about credits issued  relative to total sales  or on specific knowledge of incentives offered to retailers 
this process entails a significant amount of inherent subjectivity and uncertainty 
valuation of inventory we account for our inventory using a first in first out system in which we record inventory on our balance sheet at the lower of its cost or its net realizable value 
determination of net realizable value requires us to estimate the point in time at which an item s net realizable value drops below its cost 
we regularly review our inventory for slow moving items and for items that we are unable to sell at prices above their original cost 
when we identify such an item  we reduce its book value to the net amount that we expect to realize upon its sale 
this process entails a significant amount of inherent subjectivity and uncertainty 
carrying value of long lived assets we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in assessing the carrying values of our long lived assets 
sfas and sfas both require that we consider whether circumstances or conditions exist that suggest that the carrying value of a long lived asset might be impaired 
if such circumstances or conditions exist  further steps are required in order to determine whether the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
if analyses indicate that the asset s carrying value does exceed its fair market value  the next step is to record a loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
the steps required by sfas and sfas entail significant amounts of judgment and subjectivity 
in fiscal  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge in connection with the discontinued operations of our tactica segment  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we did not record any charges for impairment of long lived assets during fiscal economic useful life of intangible assets we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in determining the useful economic lives of intangible assets that we acquire and that we report on our consolidated balance sheets 
sfas requires that 
table of contents we amortize intangible assets  such as licenses and trademarks  over their economic useful lives  unless those assets economic useful lives are indefinite 
if an intangible asset s economic useful life is deemed to be indefinite  that asset is not amortized 
when we acquire an intangible asset  we consider factors such as the asset s history  our plans for that asset  and the market for products associated with the asset 
we consider these same factors when reviewing the economic useful lives of our previously acquired intangible assets as well 
we review the economic useful lives of our intangible assets at least annually 
the determination of the economic useful life of an intangible asset requires a significant amount of judgment and entails significant subjectivity and uncertainty 
for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies  we encourage you to read note summary of significant accounting policies  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
note contains several other policies  including policies governing the timing of revenue recognition  that are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  but do not meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgments 
forward looking information and factors that may affect future results certain written and oral statements made by our company and subsidiaries or with the approval of an authorized executive officer of our company may constitute forward looking statements as defined under the private securities litigation reform act of this includes statements made in this report  in other filings with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in certain other oral and written presentations

forward looking statements are subject to risks that could cause such statements to differ materially from actual results 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
factors that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated include general industry conditions and competition  including our ability to continue to competitively market products with broad consumer appeal  credit risks  the company s  or its operating segments  material reliance on individual customers or small numbers of customers  the company s material reliance on certain trademarks  and its ability to protect this and other intellectual property both domestically and internationally  the company s material concentration of licensing agreements with a limited number of licensors  and the continuing long term financial capability of those licensors to perform under the terms of such agreements

in order for us to preserve our current tax treatment of our non us earnings  it is critical we avoid controlled foreign corporations status 
a controlled foreign corporation is a non us corporation whose largest non us shareholders non us  those owning percent or more of its stock together own more than percent of the stock in such corporation 
if a change of ownership of the company were to occur such that the parent company became a controlled foreign corporation  such a change could have a material negative effect on the largest us shareholders and  in turn  on the company s business 
new accounting guidance in may  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that issuers classify as liabilities a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
this statement does not affect the timing of recognition of financial instruments as contingent consideration nor does it apply to obligations under stock based compensation arrangements if those obligations are accounted for under apb opinion no 
we are still reviewing the effects of sfas on our financial statements 
we currently do not have any financial instruments that are covered under this statement 
in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
fin r replaces the same titled fin that was issued in january fin r identifies when entities must be consolidated with the financial statements of a company where the investors in an entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or the entity does not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
application of this interpretation is effective for any financial statements we issue after december  we have no interests in entities covered by fin r 
therefore  fin r had no affect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates represent our primary financial market risks 
fluctuation in interest rates causes variation in the amount of interest that we can earn on our available cash and the amount of interest expense we incur on our short term borrowings 
interest on our long term debt is fixed at rates ranging from percent to percent 
increases in interest rates do not expose us to risk on this debt 
however  as interest rates drop below the rates on our long term debt  our interest cost can exceed the cost of capital of companies who borrow at lower rates of interest 
as mentioned in financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources  interest rates on our revolving credit agreement varies based on the libor rate and the period we lock libor in for 
therefore  the potential for interest rate increases exposes us to interest rate risk on our revolving credit agreement 
our revolving credit agreement with bank of america  entered into on september  allows for maximum revolving borrowings of  at the end of fiscal  there were no outstanding borrowings or open letters of credit under this credit line 
the need to borrow under this agreement could ultimately subject us to higher interest rates  thus increasing the future cost of such debt 
we do not currently hedge against interest rate risk 
as mentioned under financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources  and forward looking information and factors that may affect future results  on april   we entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets and liabilities of oxo international from wki holding company  inc  which will require approximately  at closing and is expected to close sometime in our second fiscal quarter of we are currently negotiating the interest rates  maturities  and payment terms of various potential financing instruments associated with the acquisition 
the addition of this level of debt exposure to our consolidated operations  and the uncertainty regarding the associated interest rates  maturities  and payment terms yet to be negotiated  substantially increases our risk profile 
because we purchase a majority of our inventory using us dollars  we are subject to minimal short term foreign exchange rate risk in purchasing inventory 
however long term declines in the value of the us dollar could subject us to higher inventory costs 
such an increase in inventory costs could occur if foreign vendors were to react to such a decline by raising prices 
sales in the united states are transacted in us dollars 
the majority of our sales in the united kingdom are transacted in british pounds  in france and germany are transacted in euros  and in canada are transacted in canadian dollars 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact sales  we are exposed to foreign exchange losses on those sales because our foreign currency sales prices are not adjusted for currency fluctuations 
when the us dollar weakens against those currencies  we could realize foreign currency gains 
our net sales denominated originally in currencies other than the us dollar totaled approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
our foreign currency exchange gains totaled  and  for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
in fiscal  we recorded a foreign exchange loss of  during fiscal  we began hedging against foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into a series of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
for transactions designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in the fair value arising from the change in the spot rates from period to period is deferred in other comprehensive income 
these amounts are subsequently recognized in other income net in the consolidated statements of income in the same period as the forecasted transactions close out over the remaining balance of their terms 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value arising from the change in the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate is 
table of contents recognized in the period it occurred 
these amounts are also recognized in other income net in the consolidated statements of income 
we do not enter into any forward exchange contracts or similar instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
the following table summarizes the various forward contracts we designated as cash flow hedges that were open at the end of fiscal and february  weighted market weighted average value of the range of maturities spot rate at spot rate at average forward rate contract in contract currency notational contract contract february  forward rate at february us dollars type to deliver amount date from to date at inception thousands sell pounds  sell pounds  sell euros  weighted market weighted average value of the range of maturities spot rate at spot rate at average forward rate contract in contract currency notational contract contract february  forward rate at february us dollars type to deliver amount date from to date at inception thousands sell pounds  we expect that as currency market conditions warrant  and our foreign denominated transaction exposure grows  we will continue to execute additional contracts in order to hedge against potential foreign exchange losses
