table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts amounts billed by the company under revenue guarantee arrangements are subject to our interpretation of the applicable code share agreement and are subject to audit by our code share partners 
periodically our code share partners dispute amounts billed and pay amounts less than the amount billed 
ultimate collection of the remaining amounts not only depends upon mesa prevailing under audit  but also upon the financial well being of the code share partner 
as such  the company periodically reviews amounts past due and records a reserve for amounts estimated to be uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at september  and  respectively 
if the company s actual ability to collect these receivables and the actual financial viability of its partners is materially different than estimated  the company s estimate of the allowance could be materially understated or overstated 
accrued health care costs the company is currently self insured for health care costs and as such  a reserve for the cost of claims that have not been paid as of the balance sheet date is estimated 
the company s estimate of this reserve is based upon historical claim experience and upon the recommendations of its health care provider 
at september  and  the company accrued million and million  respectively  for the cost of future health care claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the reserves for future health care claims could be materially overstated or understated 
long lived assets  aircraft and parts held for sale property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives to their estimated salvage values using the straight line method 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount may be impaired 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company records an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows are found to be less than the carrying amount of the asset

valuation of deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets for the value of benefits expected to be realized from the utilization of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and state and federal net operating loss carryforwards 
the company periodically reviews these assets for realizability based upon expected taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
to the extent the company believes some portion of the benefit may not be realizable  an estimate of the unrealized portion is made and an allowance is recorded 
at september   the company had no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as it believes it will generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize its recorded deferred tax assets 
this belief is based upon the company having had pretax income in fiscal  and excluding impairment charges and as the company has taken steps to minimize the financial impact of its unprofitable subsidiaries 
realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of any net operating loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets will be realized 
if the ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is significantly different from the company s expectations  the value of its deferred tax assets could be materially overstated 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share 
eitf issue no 
requires shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of contingently convertible debt instruments to be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share whether or not the contingent 
table of contents conditions for conversion have been met  unless the inclusion of these shares is anti dilutive 
previously  shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of contingently convertible debt securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
eitf issue no 
is effective for reporting periods ending after december  if applicable  eitf issue no 
will require the restatement of prior period diluted earnings per share amounts

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations and short term marketable investment portfolio 
certain of the company s debt obligations are variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in an approximately million impact on interest expense 
the company also has investments in debt securities 
if short term interest rates were to average more than they did in fiscal year interest income would be impacted by approximately million 
the company s investments in equity securities are subject to market risk related to fluctuations in share prices for those shares held 
a change in the price of trading securities held at the level of investment at september  would impact the results of the company by approximately million 
we have exposure to certain market risks associated with our aircraft fuel 
aviation fuel expense is a significant expense for any air carrier and even marginal changes in the cost of fuel greatly impact a carrier s profitability 
standard industry contracts do not generally provide protection against fuel price increases  nor do they insure availability of supply 
however  the america west  united and us airways revenue guarantee code share agreements allow fuel costs to be reimbursed by the code share partner  thereby reducing our overall exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in fiscal  of our fuel requirements were associated with these contracts 
each one cent change in the price of jet fuel amounts to a million change in annual fuel costs for that portion of fuel expense that is not reimbursed by our code share partners
