item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are principally a motor carrier  also commonly referred to as a trucking company 
we offer various transportation services to customers in the united states  canada and mexico 
all of our services involve the over the road movement of freight 
in the united states  we sometimes also arrange for the use of railroads to transport our loaded trailers between major cities 
most of our revenue is from service which is order based  meaning that we separately bill our customers for each shipment 
a minority of our revenue is from services which are asset based  meaning that we bill our customer for the use of a truck and driver for a period of time  without regard to the number of shipments hauled 
we also refer to our asset based service as dedicated fleets  because in these arrangements  the trucks and drivers involved are assigned for use by a specific customer on a full time basis 
order based services are either full truckload or less than truckload ltl 
our trailers are designed to carry up to  pounds of freight 
shipments weighing  pounds or more are full truckload  while shipments of less than that amount are classified as ltl 
asset based services are full truckload 
customers let us know that they have shipments requiring transportation and inform us as to any special requirements  such as an identification of the type of product to be shipped  the origin and destination of the load and the expected time by which delivery must occur 
we inform our customers of our availability to haul the freight and of the price we will charge 
if these fit with the needs of the customer  we schedule the freight for pickup 
shipments have three stages  pick up  linehaul and delivery 
the linehaul stage is over the road and involves longer distances 
most of our full truckload shipments will have all of these stages performed by the same truck 
ltl shipments typically involve different trucks for each of the three stages 
for ltl  the linehaul stage may also involve more than one truck as the freight moves among our network of ltl terminals 
for example  an ltl truck bound from los angeles to dallas may carry shipments destined for dallas  chicago and atlanta 
once the truck arrives in dallas  the freight for chicago and atlanta will be sorted and sent out from dallas on different trucks to those cities with other ltl shipments that originated in dallas or arrived there on trucks from other areas of the country 
a linehaul load of ltl typically weighs  to  pounds and is comprised of between and individual shipments 
we operate under three primary brand names  ffe transportation services ffe  lisa motor lines lml and american eagle lines ael 
ffe and lml specialize in products that require temperature control 
most shipments require the maintenance of a cold temperature ranging from minus degrees to plus degrees fahrenheit 
examples include perishable food  beverages  candy  pharmaceuticals  photographic supplies and electronics 
other products require maintenance of a warm temperature in the colder months to prevent freezing while in transit  such as nursery stock and liquid products 
ffe conducts all of our ltl business and also has significant order based and asset based full truckload operations 
lml specializes in order based full truckload operations 
ael serves the market for order based and asset based full truckload activities that do not require temperature control 
the assets we must have for temperature controlled service are costly to acquire and maintain 
the rates we charge for our temperature controlled services are usually higher than other companies who offer no temperature controlled services 
many products that require protection from the heat during the warmer months of the year do not require protection during the colder months 
therefore  during the warmer months  demand for our temperature controlled full truckload and ltl increases 
there are several companies that provide national temperature controlled full truckload services 
we know of no other company providing nationwide ltl temperature controlled service 
the vast majority of companies that are nationwide in scope  like our ael brand  offer only full truckload service with no temperature control 
therefore  the markets that are served by ael tend to be very price competitive and generally lack the level of seasonality as in our ffe and lml operations 
because consumer demand for products requiring temperature control is often less sensitive to economic cycles  revenue from ffe and lml tends to be less volatile during such cycles 
during  our ltl revenue increased substantially over the prior year  after declines during the years leading up to the increase was a result of our principal national temperature controlled ltl competitor having ceased operations 
we do not believe that the market for refrigerated ltl services improved significantly in general during  but we do believe that the level of our specific operations improved because of the reduction in capacity in the marketplace 
accordingly  we do not project that the years following will see the same magnitude of changes in the level of our ltl operations 

table of contents over the past few years  ael has been the fastest growing of our brands  and accounted for of our freight revenue 
much of what ael hauls are products the demand for which exhibits more fluctuation with economic activity 
clothing  electronics  beauty supplies  hygiene products and household appliances are principal among ael s freight 
as consumer demand for such products improved during  much of our revenue growth from our full truckload activities was from ael 
full truckload revenue from our temperature controlled brands also increased during  but to a lesser extent than was the case for ael 
the trucking business is highly competitive 
during  the last year for which data is available  there were several thousand companies operating in all sectors of the trucking business in the united states 
among those  the top companies offering primarily temperature controlled services collectively generated revenue of billion 
the next such companies collectively generated revenues of billion 
in  we ranked third in terms of revenue generated among all temperature controlled motor carriers 
we have nearly  active customers for our trucking business 
we generally collect cash for our services between and days after our service is provided 
trucking companies of our size face challenges to be successful 
costs for labor  maintenance and insurance rise every year 
fuel prices can increase or decrease quite rapidly 
due to the high level of competitiveness  it is difficult to pass these rising costs on to our customers 
over the past few years  many trucking companies have ceased operations  resulting in a reduced number of alternatives and increasing the awareness among customers that price increases for trucking services are likely 
late in  we began to more aggressively seek price increases from our customers 
these efforts  which have been somewhat successful  will continue into and beyond 
we also have a non freight business that deals in vehicle air conditioning components and compressors for use in stationary refrigeration equipment  such as grocery store coolers and freezers 
over the past few years  we have incurred substantial losses in this business 
in late  the president of our non freight subsidiary was replaced with a specialist in the management and turn around of troubled companies 
we have taken significant measures to reduce the cost of operating this business and have begun to focus on opportunities to restore our non freight operations to profitability 
if these efforts do not succeed during  we will more likely than not terminate or sell our non freight operations 
critical accounting estimates we have a number of critical accounting estimates 
these require a more significant amount of management judgement than the other accounting policies we employ 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue and expense recognition in our freight operations  which accounted for of our consolidated revenue  we recognize revenue and estimated direct operating expenses such as fuel and labor on the date we receive shipments from our customers 
in  the emerging issues tax force eitf of the financial accounting standards board promulgated issue  revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process eitf 
in  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides that eitf sets forth the revenue and expense recognition methods that may be used in our industry 
according to eitf  our manner of recognizing revenue and expenses for freight in process is acceptable 
the other methods generally defer the recognition of revenue and expenses to as late as the date on which delivery of the shipments is completed 
we have consistently utilized our manner of revenue and expense recognition since we began operations in because our income statements contain accruals for revenue and associated estimated direct expenses as of the beginning and the end of each reporting period  we believe that if we were to change our manner of recognizing revenue and associated estimated direct expenses to one of the other methods allowed by eitf  our results of operations would be substantially unaffected 
in such an event  each period s revenue and expenses would be adjusted to include in revenue amounts from freight in process at the beginning of the period and to exclude from revenue those amounts from freight in process at the end of the same period 
we believe that these amounts would essentially offset one another from period to period  resulting in minimal impact to our operating or net income 
personal and work related injury the trucking business involves risk of injury to our employees and the public 
prior to  we retained the first  and million of these risks  respectively  on a per occurrence basis 
due primarily to conditions in the insurance marketplace  in and  we retained the first million for work related injuries and the first million for public liability risk 
this arrangement will continue during since our company was founded in  events above the level of our pre retentions have been extremely rare 

table of contents because our public liability and work related injury retentions are higher than in previous years  the potential adverse impact a single occurrence can have on our results is more significant than before 
when an event involving potential liability occurs  our internal staff of risk management professionals estimates the range of most probable outcomes 
based on that estimate  we record a reserve in our financial statements during the period in which the event occurred 
as additional information becomes available  we increase or reduce the amount of this reserve 
we also maintain additional reserves for public liability and work related injury events that may have been incurred but not reported 
as of december   our reserves for personal injury  work related injury  cargo and other claims against us aggregated million 
if we were to change our estimates making up those reserves up or down by in the aggregate  the impact on net income would have been million  and earnings per share of common stock would have been impacted by 
estimate of uncollectible accounts we extend trade credit to our customers 
we also establish a reserve to represent our estimate of accounts that will not ultimately be collected 
once we conclude that a specific invoice is unlikely to be paid by the customer  we charge the invoice against the reserve 
we estimate the amount of our bad debt reserve based on the composite age of our receivables 
during  the amount of our bad debt reserve increased by million and the amount of receivables that were more than days old increased by million 
significant changes in our receivables aging could impact our profits and financial condition 
as of december   our reserve for uncollectible accounts was million 
if our estimate were to change by  net income would have been impacted by  or per share of common stock 
deferred taxes our deferred tax liability of  is stated net of offsetting deferred tax assets 
the assets consist of anticipated future tax deductions for an operating loss carry forward of million as well as future tax deductions  such as insurance and bad debt expenses which have been reflected on our statements of income but which are not yet tax deductible 
the net operating loss carry forward begins to expire in in total  our deferred tax assets are about million  which includes the net operating loss carry forward 
at current federal tax rates  we will need to generate nearly million in future taxable income in order to fully realize our deferred tax assets 
for and  the federal government has authorized bonus tax deductions for the depreciation of property and equipment put into service in those years 
we estimate the bonus depreciation reduced our federally taxable income for by more than million  and without the bonus depreciation  we would have incurred a currently payable federal income tax liability during although the bonus depreciation may similarly impact our taxable income for  we believe it probable that we will generate sufficient taxable income in and beyond to fully utilize the net operating loss carry forward and the remainder of our deferred tax assets 
if our expectation of such realizability diminishes  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance on our balance sheet 
that could diminish our net income 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees based on the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  if the exercise price of employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date  no compensation expense is recorded 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

had we used sfas no 
to account for our stock based compensation for  and  our net income for and  respectively  would have been  and  less and our net loss for would have been  more than our reported results 
the impact on our per share earnings or loss for  and would have been  
and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations freight revenue the rates we charge for our services include fuel adjustment charges 
in periods when the price we incur for diesel fuel is high  we raise our prices in an effort to recover this increase from our customers 
the opposite is true when fuel prices decline 
during the years ended december   and  fuel adjustment charges comprised  and  respectively  of our freight revenue  as follows in thousands full truckload revenue excluding fuel adjustments fuel adjustments ltl revenue excluding fuel adjustments fuel adjustments total freight revenue excluding fuel adjustments fuel adjustments the following discussion of our freight revenue excludes fluctuations due to fuel adjustment charges 
the following table sets forth information regarding revenue excluding fuel adjustment charges from our full truckload and ltl freight services for each of the three years ended december  in thousands except per mile amounts full truckload revenue shipments total miles per mile revenue ltl revenue shipments total miles per mile revenue full truckload revenue for the years ended december  and increased by and  respectively  as compared to the immediately preceding years 
although the number of full truckload shipments increased at rates in excess of the rate of full truckload revenue growth  the increases in shipment count were tempered by a shortened average length of haul 
this resulted in lower average revenue per full truckload shipment 
ltl revenue for the years ended december  and increased by and  respectively  as compared to the year ago periods 
for decades  most of the market for nationwide refrigerated ltl service has been shared between alterman transport lines atl and ourselves 
we competed primarily on price and breadth of service 
in recent years  atl s annual ltl revenue was about half as much as our ltl revenue 
during december of  atl announced that it planned to cease operations and liquidate  a process that began in january of as a result  we have experienced a significant increase in our volume of ltl shipments 
although we expect this increased activity to carry over into future periods  there can be no assurance that will occur 
the sharp increase in our ltl activities has caused us to re deploy some of our vehicles from primarily hauling full truckload freight to ltl 
that has resulted in a somewhat diminished rate of growth for our full truckload revenue 
reduced demand for ltl services  together with the increased presence of competitors capable of arranging such services  resulted in a decrease in the number of ltl shipments we transported in and most of as compared to while ltl operations offer the opportunity to earn higher revenue on a per mile and per hundredweight basis than do full truckload operations  the level of investment and fixed costs associated with ltl activities significantly exceed those of full truckload activities 
accordingly  as ltl revenue fluctuates  many costs remain fixed  leveraging the impact from such revenue fluctuations on our operating income 
during and most of  as ltl activity and revenue declined  many ltl related costs remained static 

table of contents we periodically assess the profitability of our ltl operations 
as a result  we closed ltl terminals during and we also periodically alter the frequency at which we service locations where freight volumes have declined and change the mix of our company operated vs 
independent contractor provided trucks in order to more closely match our operating costs to the level of our ltl revenue 
at december   our entire ltl fleet consisted of approximately tractors  as compared to about at the end of both of the prior two years 
when the level of our ltl activity increases during peak times of the year  we often re deploy full truckload trucks to handle the overload 
at the end of  our full truckload fleet numbered approximately  trucks  as compared to about  at the end of and  at the end of primarily due to the increased number of trucks  the number of full truckload shipments rose by during and in  in each case when compared to the immediate preceding year 
the number of trucks in our full truckload company operated fleet rose by during and by to approximately  during as of december   there were approximately  tractors in our full truckload company operated fleet 
continued emphasis will be placed on improving the efficiency and the utilization of this fleet through enhanced driver training and retention  by reducing the percentage of non revenue producing miles  by extending the average loaded miles per shipment and through expansion of dedicated fleet operations 
about of our full truckload company operated fleet is now engaged in dedicated fleet operations 
in such an arrangement  we provide service involving the assignment of trucks and drivers solely to handle transportation needs of a specific customer 
generally we  and the customer  expect dedicated fleet logistics services to lower the customer s transportation costs and improve the quality of the service 
we have continued to improve our capability to provide  and expanded our efforts to market  dedicated fleet services 
our full truckload fleets use satellite technology to enhance efficiency and customer service 
location updates of each tractor are provided by this network and we exchange dispatch  fuel and other information with the driver by way of satellite 
effective january  the federal agency that regulates motor carrier safety began to enforce hours of service hos rules  which limit the number of hours truck drivers may work in a shift and drive in a shift 
time in a shift spent by a driver in fueling  loading and waiting to load or unload freight count as non driving work hours 
the old hos rules were introduced in  and the new rules are intended by the government to more closely reflect the equipment and roads in use today  as compared to sixty five years ago 
the new rules generally expand from ten to eleven the number of hours that a person can drive an over the road truck in a shift  but reduce from fifteen to fourteen the number of hours such a person can work during the same shift 
also  under the old hos rules  time spent in the middle of a shift waiting to load or unload did not count as hours worked  but such time does count as hours worked under the new hos rules 
the new rules also extend from eight to ten the number of hours that drivers must rest between on duty shifts 
in order to compensate our drivers and offset our other expenses from diminished asset utilization  we are seeking compensation from our customers rate increases and detention fees 
such detention fees are designed to motivate our customers to expedite the loading and unloading of their freight  thereby maximizing the number of hours that our drivers can drive during a work shift 
freight operating expenses changes in the proportion of revenue from full truckload versus ltl shipments  as well as in the mix of company provided versus independent contractor provided equipment and in the mix of leased versus owned equipment  contribute to variations among operating and interest expenses 
the following table sets forth  as a percentage of freight revenue  certain major operating expenses for each of the three years ended december salaries  wages and related expenses purchased transportation supplies and expenses revenue equipment rent and depreciation claims and insurance other total freight operating expenses 
table of contents salaries and wages salaries  wages and related expenses  as a percent of freight revenue  were  and for  and  respectively 
the following table compares the and million increases in these expenses between and and between and  respectively percentage of increase in salaries  wages and related expenses attributable to vs 
vs 
driver salaries non driver salaries payroll taxes work related injuries health insurance and other driver salaries increased primarily as a result of the increase in size of our company operated fleets 
although the total number of company operated trucks only rose by to  at the end of when compared to the end of  the number of company operated ltl trucks rose by to during that period 
because individual ltl employee drivers earn a higher salary than their full truckload counterparts  the increased size of the company operated ltl fleet was the principal reason for s higher driver payroll expenses and related payroll taxes 
similarly  the expanded level of our ltl activities resulted in the need to employ more dispatchers  supervisors  and marketing and customer service personnel 
during december of  we opened two additional terminals to handle the increasing number of ltl shipments 
that coupled with annual payroll adjustments for our non driver employees were the principal contributors to s higher level of non driver salaries and related payroll taxes 
costs associated with work related injuries increased by during  as compared to and an additional in as compared to self insured work related injuries incurred by drivers are the primary contributors to this expense  and the number of our employee drivers increased by during and by during accordingly  the increases in our expense from work related injuries during the past two years has resulted in significant part from the escalating costs associated with such claims 
fees charged by healthcare providers is a factor in our work related injury expenses 
we share the cost of health insurance with our employees 
for the past several years  we have experienced double digit percentage health insurance cost increases 
during mid  we changed to a plan that increased both the amounts employees pay to participate and the amount of medical costs that must be borne by our employees 
that helped us reduce the rate at which our costs have increased 
during non recessionary economic periods  we typically have difficulty attracting qualified employee drivers for our full truckload operations 
such shortages increase costs of employee driver compensation  training and recruiting 
significant resources are continually devoted to recruiting and retaining qualified employee drivers and to improving their job satisfaction 
as the economy softened during and  previous shortages of qualified drivers diminished  but as the economy improved during we began to experience more difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified employee drivers 
some of our competitors have recently increased their employee driver pay scales 
we are monitoring this situation and will consider such an increase should the need arise 
the last such increase we implemented was during purchased transportation the following table summarizes our purchased transportation expense for each of the three years ended december   by type of shipment in millions amount of purchased transportation expense incurred for full truckload ltl intermodal and other the number of owner operator provided trucks in our ltl fleets has not changed appreciably over the past three years  but the amount of purchased transportation for ltl equipment increased by nearly a third during this is a result of the sharp increase in our ltl shipment count and revenue 

table of contents we run our ltl service on schedules  much like an airline 
when terminal departure times arrive  our ltl trucks depart  whether or not they are fully loaded 
the only other major nationwide provider of refrigerated ltl service ceased operations in early that event resulted in the sharp increase in ltl shipments  but much of that increase was handled by trucks from our fleets that were already providing the scheduled service 
because we already had excess capacity in our ltl operation  we were able to service much of the increased freight with equipment that was already present in our fleet 
in addition  much of the increased ltl volume during was handled by our fleet of company operated ltl trucks  which increased substantially during also  during  the amount of ltl freight transported by owner operator provided trucks which normally haul full truckload shipments increased significantly 
independent contractor equipment generated  and of our full truckload revenue during  and  respectively 
independent contractors provide a tractor that they own to transport freight on our behalf 
during each of the past three years  between and of our ltl revenue was generated by independent contractor equipment 
contractors pay for the cost of operating their tractors  including but not limited to the expense of fuel  labor  taxes and maintenance 
we pay independent contractors amounts generally determined by reference to the revenue associated with their activities 
at the beginning of  there were approximately such tractors in the full truckload fleet 
by the end of  there were approximately such tractors 
at december  and  there were about and  respectively 
as the number of these trucks fluctuates  so too does the amount of revenue generated by such units 
as a result of fluctuations in the quantity and revenue contribution of such equipment  and as a result of the impact of fuel adjustment charges  which are passed through to independent contractors involved in the transportation of shipments billed with such charges  the percent of freight revenue absorbed by purchased transportation rose from in to in and in in providing our full truckload service  we often engage railroads to transport shipments between major cities 
in such an arrangement called intermodal service  loaded trailers are transported to a rail facility and placed on flat cars for transport to their destination 
on arrival  one of our company operated or independent contractor provided tractors will pick up the trailer and deliver the freight to the consignee 
intermodal service is generally less costly than using one of our own trucks for such movements  but other factors also influence our decision to utilize intermodal services 
during  the number of intermodal full truckload shipments increased by  as many of our normally full truckload trucks were occupied in handling ltl freight 
these factors contributed to our increase of intermodal services in the transport of full truckload freight 
supplies and expenses the following table summarizes the major components of our cost for operating supplies and expenses during each of the three years ended december  percent of supplies and expenses incurred for fuel repairs and maintenance driver travel expenses freight handling tires other supplies and expenses rose by million in  decreased by million in and increased by million during  in each case when compared to the immediately preceding year 
most of s decrease and s increase was related to the price of diesel fuel for our company operated fleet of tractors and trailers 
during  our average price per gallon fell by from levels  but in the average price per gallon of diesel fuel we paid increased by about  as compared to fuel price volatility impacts our profits 
for example  in early  the average price we paid for diesel fuel increased by or more compared to our average price during we have in place a number of strategies designed to address this 
independent contractors are responsible for all costs associated with their equipment  including fuel 
therefore  the cost of such fuel is not a direct expense of the company 
for company operated equipment  we attempt to mitigate the impact of fluctuating fuel costs by purchasing fuel efficient tractors and aggressively managing our fuel purchasing 
the rates we charge for our services are usually adjustable by reference to fuel prices 
rising or falling fuel prices result in adjustment of our freight rates  further mitigating but not eliminating the impact of such volatility on our profits 
fuel price fluctuations result from many external market factors that we cannot influence or predict 
although we have never used derivatives to hedge our exposure to escalating fuel prices  we may decide to utilize them in the future 
also  each year several states increase fuel and mileage taxes 
recovery of future increases or realization of future decreases in fuel prices  will continue to depend upon competitive freight market conditions 

table of contents in late  we began to take delivery of new trucks equipped with federally mandated diesel engines designed to reduce the level of exhaust particulates 
the new engines were expected to be about less fuel efficient  more expensive to maintain and are significantly more expensive to acquire than the engines that were in trucks manufactured before 
most of the trucks currently in our fleet were manufactured before mid and will continue to operate with the older model engines 
they will be replaced with newer engine trucks over a three to four year period 
although it is too soon to tell what impact the newer engines will have on our maintenance expenses  we have seen some increased fuel consumption in our newer engine equipped trucks 
that has added to the increased level of our fuel expenses during we use computer software to optimize our routing and fuel purchasing 
the software enables us to select the most efficient route for a trip 
it also assists us in deciding on a real time basis how much fuel to buy at a particular fueling station 
the software has enabled us to reduce our fuel consumption since the non fuel components of supplies and expenses rose by million in  fell by about  in and increased by million during  in each case when compared to the immediately preceding year 
the improvement resulted from more effective management of our efforts to recruit qualified drivers 
a significant portion of s increase was the result of a problem we discovered with some of our trailer axles 
certain trailers delivered during and had a re designed hub assembly that was factory installed with an insufficient amount of lubricant 
a number of these axles and components failed  but most were replaced at our expense before failure could occur 
we are seeking to recover these expenses from the manufacturers involved  but the outcome remains uncertain at this time 
increased freight handling expenses accounted for about two thirds of the increase 
although freight handling expenses are present in both our ltl and full truckload activities  such expenses are mostly ltl related 
the increased level of these costs between and is a result of the sharp increase in the number of ltl shipments we handled 
rentals and depreciation the total of revenue equipment rent and depreciation expense was of freight revenue in  in and in these fluctuations were due in part to changes in the use of leasing to finance our fleet 
equipment rental includes a component of interest related expense that is classified as non operating expense when we incur debt to acquire equipment 
equipment rent and depreciation also are affected by the replacement of less expensive  older model company operated tractors and trailers with more expensive new equipment 
in  our tractor replacement cycle was extended 
for more than years through  our primary tractor manufacturer contracted to repurchase our new trucks at the end of years of service for an agreed price 
during  as the economy softened and demand for new and used trucking assets slackened  the manufacturer found itself with a surplus of used trucks which were difficult to re sell at prices near the amount the manufacturer had been paying us 
such sell back arrangements have been typical in the trucking industry for many years 
in we agreed to amend our sell back arrangement 
our tractors will be sold back to the manufacturer under more restrictive terms 
also  the trade back cycle for most of our trucks in service on december  and for trucks delivered to us by this manufacturer after january  was extended by up to months 
the lower pre agreed to prices for trucks delivered to us after january  resulted in slightly higher monthly cost over the lives of the trucks 
in order to help us with the increased cost of maintaining tractors beyond our former month replacement cycle  the manufacturer agreed to extend the warranties on specified major components of the tractors 
the more restrictive terms on the trade back will require that we more closely align our tractor purchases with resale to the manufacturer 
it is probable that our maintenance costs will increase as a result of our new arrangement 
we believe that we are not paying more for our new trucks than would be the case if we bought competitive equipment without such a trade back feature 
during through  several thousand motor carriers ceased or curtailed their level of operations  resulting in a surplus of two to three year old trucking assets available in the marketplace  at deeply discounted prices 
we have been able to benefit from this situation by acquiring some high quality previously owned tractors and trailers at attractive prices 
although the number of such used truck purchasing opportunities has diminished as the industry has improved  we will continue to seek out such opportunities where available 

table of contents for many years  we have based our trailer depreciation on a seven year replacement cycle 
based on the results of a study we completed in the third quarter of  beginning in the last three months of  we increased our replacement cycle for owned non refrigerated trailers from seven to ten years 
owned refrigerated  leased refrigerated and leased non refrigerated trailers will remain on a seven year replacement cycle 
the change in our service lives of our non refrigerated trailers reduced our depreciation expense by about  from what would have otherwise been reported 
the impact on our income is expected to diminish in and beyond  because we expect that gains we may realize on the ultimate sale of these trailers will be less than they otherwise would have been 
our diluted per share earnings for were not impacted by the change 
claims and insurance for and  our claims and insurance cost per mile driven diminished by and  respectively  in each year when compared to the immediately preceding year 
early in  the truckload carriers association  an industry association  announced that we had been awarded second place among dozens of companies of size comparable to us in their annual safety recognition award program 
claims and insurance expense was of freight revenue during and declined to in and to in this resulted from a variety of factors  including but not limited to fewer physical damage losses 
in december of  we renewed our liability insurance coverage 
previously  we had incurred significant but fairly predictable premiums and a comparatively low deductible for accident claims 
during and  insurance companies began to increase premiums by as much as to 
at the same time  our overall accident frequency measured as incidents per million miles improved  but accidents involving personal injury became more severe 
because of these factors  in  we selected a liability insurance product that featured a higher deductible and a higher premium 
during the first months of  the marketplace for such coverage continued to harden 
the attacks on america resulted in a more unpredictable and costly insurance market 
trucking and other transportation companies reported significant cost increases in their insurance premiums 
after a careful analysis of our claims experience and premium quotations from the limited number of carriers offering insurance to our industry in  we selected a liability insurance product with reduced coverage limits  a modestly lower premium and with a deductible of million per occurrence  as compared to million for the expiring policy 
during and again in  we renewed our liability insurance with the same deductible as in  but in we were able to significantly increase the coverage limit of our liability policy 
we have accrued for our estimated costs related to public liability  cargo and work related injury claims 
when an incident occurs we record a reserve for the incident s estimated outcome 
as additional information becomes available  adjustments are often made 
accrued claims liabilities include all such reserves and our estimate for incidents which have been incurred but not reported 
it is probable that the estimate we have accrued for at any point in time will change in the future 
because of the level of uncertainty regarding our claims reserves  we cannot reliably estimate a range of possible outcomes for our loss contingencies 
because the amount of our retained risk is more than before  we need to establish greater amounts of per claim insurance reserves and related expenses than we did before 
this could significantly increase the volatility of our earnings 
we will continue to monitor the insurance market 
when affordable policies with lower deductibles return to the market  we will evaluate all opportunities to lower our deductible 
claims and insurance expenses can vary significantly from year to year 
the amount of open claims is significant 
there can be no assurance that these claims will be settled without a material adverse effect on our financial position or our results of operations 
other and miscellaneous expense gains on the disposition of equipment were between and million in each of the three years ended december  the amount of such gains depends primarily upon conditions in the market for previously owned equipment and on the quantity of retired equipment sold 
we usually pre arrange the retirement sales value when we accept delivery of a new tractor 
before  the market for used trucking equipment was quite strong 
the pre arranged retirement value for tractors delivered in through were accordingly  high 
during and  the market value of previously owned trucking equipment fell dramatically 
the market value of these assets improved somewhat during and further in fluctuations in the market value of our leased equipment do not impact the pre arranged retirement value of tractors presently in our fleet  but softness in the market for used equipment could diminish future pre arranged retirement values 
that may require us to increase the amount of depreciation and rental expense we incur in and beyond 

table of contents we do not expect used equipment market prices to alter our current depreciation or rental expense related to trailers  but diminished market values could reduce the amount of gains on sale of trailers in future periods 
miscellaneous expenses were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
a primary component of these expenses is our loss from uncollectible accounts receivable  which was the primary reason for these increases 
higher legal and professional fees associated with matters other than the management of liability claims against us also contributed to the higher level of miscellaneous expense since  as did a write down of intangible assets during the professional fee increase was related to legal and auditing expenses for general corporate matters and our continuing efforts to comply with new corporate governance and financial reporting requirements 
the intangible assets we wrote down were related to trade names and other assets we previously acquired but have now effectively abandoned 
non freight losses as we head into  our non freight operations consist of a business that sells parts for passenger and commercial vehicle air conditioning systems and also re manufactures compressors for stationary refrigeration systems such as frozen food display cases and walk in coolers 
a smaller business that had break even results since we bought it in was sold for its approximate  book value back to its previous owner for cash during the fourth quarter of this business installs air conditioning systems on large passenger vehicles  such as school buses 
for  revenue from our non freight business improved by to million from million during our non freight operating expenses in increased by when compared with for the year ended december  non freight operating losses rose to million  as compared to losses of million during and million during we have been dissatisfied with the lack of our progress in turning our non freight operations into positive contributors to our profitability 
accordingly  in november we engaged a consulting firm to manage our non freight operations 
the principal of the consulting firm was appointed as the president of our non freight subsidiaries 
during the third and fourth quarters of  our non freight subsidiary recorded inventory write downs aggregating million 
the purpose of these write downs was to reflect our assets at the lower of our cost or market value  as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
further analysis of such market values was conducted after new management was put in place during the fourth quarter of the disappointing quantities of the inventory that we were able to sell during was a primary factor in our decision to dispose of a significant amount of the inventory and reduce our expectation as to the net realizable value of what remains 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in additional write downs of our non freight inventory 
we do not presently expect to record further write downs of our non freight inventories 
the turnaround specialist has been retained to lead our efforts to eliminate the potential for future losses from our remaining non freight operations  and to conduct a review of strategic alternatives 
at this time  we cannot predict what the results might be 
if our efforts to restore these operations to profitability during do not succeed  we will more likely than not terminate or sell our non freight operations 
preliminary results for the first two months of have been somewhat encouraging 
these operations conduct most of their business during the warmer months of the year 
we therefore will be better able to evaluate the results of our efforts as year end approaches 
at the end of  we sold the largest component of our non freight operations 
the business we sold is a dealership engaged in the sale and service of refrigeration equipment and of trailers used in freight transportation 
we sold the majority of the operating assets of the dealership 
the buyer also assumed all liabilities associated with the dealership 
the assets we sold had a book value of million 
the assumed liabilities totaled approximately million 
when the sale closed  we received as consideration million in cash  a note receivable from the buyer for million and a limited partnership interest in the buyer group to which we assigned a value of million 
our note receivable from the buyer is subordinated to senior debt  which the buyer borrowed to obtain the cash we received at closing 
the note must be repaid in equal installments beginning in december of in december of  the buyer paid us million in cash as a prepayment of the note 
interest payments are due monthly 
we account for our limited partnership interest according to the equity method 
non freight revenue of million in consisted of about million from the dealership we sold in december of and about million from the rest of our non freight business 

table of contents operating income the following table summarizes our operating results from our freight and non freight operations in thousands income loss from freight operations non freight operations interest and other the following table summarizes our interest and other expenses during each of the three years ended december  in thousands interest expense interest income life insurance and other income expense interest expense represents our cost for borrowed funds 
interest income represents our income from invested funds and notes receivable 
a major component of our interest and other non operating income or expense has to do with transactions involving and changes in the net cash surrender value of our life insurance investments 
during and  transactions involving our life insurance assets resulted in net investment expense of about and million  respectively  as compared to million in net investment income for we do not expect these investments to result in the magnitude of income or expense in the future as occurred in the three years ended december  pre tax and net income for  we earned pre tax income of million as compared to pre tax losses of million for and  for during and  we incurred income tax expense of  and  respectively 
during  our benefit from income taxes was million 
our pre tax results reflect transactions associated with life insurance and other matters that are not includable in federally taxable income 
for  this resulted in our having a pre tax loss for financial reporting purposes  but taxable income for purposes of determining our income tax expense 
therefore  for  our after tax loss was more than our pre tax loss 
in certain prior years  we recorded income tax deductions for interest paid on loans against insurance policies as allowed under united states federal tax laws 
due to the uncertainty of such deductions  we maintained a million reserve for the contingent expense that could have resulted from any related tax assessments 
during  the risk of a tax assessment had ended and the reserve for any related expense was no longer required 
we therefore reversed the amount of the reserve as a non recurring reduction of our income tax expense 
we have net operating loss carry forwards that will  if not taken against future taxable income  begin to expire in the year during and  we reported net income of and million  respectively as compared to a net loss of  for liquidity and capital resources debt and working capital cash from our freight revenue is typically collected between and days after the service has been provided 
we continually seek to accelerate our collection of accounts receivable to enhance our liquidity and reduce our debt 
our freight business is highly dependent on the use of fuel  labor  operating supplies and equipment provided by owner operators 
we are typically obligated to pay for these resources within seven to fifteen days after we use them  so our payment cycle is a significantly shorter interval than is our collection cycle 
this disparity between cash payments to our suppliers and cash receipts from our customers creates significant needs for borrowed funds to finance our working capital  especially during the busiest time of our fiscal year 
due primarily to the increase in our ltl revenue throughout  net accounts receivable at december  rose by million  or as compared to december   but our accounts payable and accrued salaries together increased by only million 
the million net effect of these changes on our working capital was a primary reason for s million increase in our long term debt  especially during the busiest time of our fiscal year 

table of contents during  we entered into a new million credit agreement with two banks 
the credit agreement expires on may  debt may be secured by our revenue equipment  trade accounts receivable and inventories 
as of december   we were using million of the credit facility for borrowed funds  and million as security for letters of credit  for a total utilization of million of the million available to us 
accordingly  our remaining availability was million at the end of the credit agreement contains several restrictive covenants  including the ratio of our annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rental ebitdar to the amount of our annual fixed charges may not be less than fixed charges generally include interest payments  rental expense  taxes paid and any portion of long term debt presently due but not paid 
the ratio of our funded debt to ebitdar may not exceed funded debt generally includes the amount borrowed under the credit agreement or similar arrangements  letters of credit secured by the credit agreement and the aggregate minimum amount of operating lease payments we are obligated to pay in the future 
the yearly sum of our income plus taxes and non recurring or extraordinary expense as defined in the credit agreement must be a positive amount 
our tangible net worth tnw must remain an amount greater than million plus of the positive amounts of our quarterly net income for each fiscal quarter which began since april  tnw is generally defined as our net shareholders equity  minus intangible and certain other assets plus of any cash we receive from the issuance of equity securities 
we may not enter into a merger or acquire another entity without the prior consent of our banks 
the annual amount of our net expenditures for property  plant and equipment may not be more than million after taking into account the amounts we receive from the sale of retired property  plant and equipment 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our restrictive covenants and we project that our compliance will remain intact during we expect to renegotiate the terms of and extend the maturity of our credit agreement during mid cash flows during  and cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in operating cash flows resulted primarily from increased accounts receivable and the increase was principally due to improvement in the operating results of our freight transportation segment 
expenditures for property and equipment totaled million in  million in and million during cash proceeds from the sale of retired equipment were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in addition  we financed  through operating leases  the addition of revenue equipment valued at approximately million in  million in and million during obligations and commitments we lease equipment and real estate 
as of december  our debt was million and letters of credit issued by us for insurance purposes and to equipment leasing companies were million in total 
also  as of december   we had contracts to purchase tractors and trailers totaling million during a summary of these obligations is as follows in millions 
table of contents payments due by year total after operating leases debt and letters of credit purchase obligations rentals are due under non cancelable operating leases 
during  we continued our long standing practice of leasing most of our new company operated tractors and refrigerated trailers from various unrelated leasing companies 
most of our tractor leases involve end of lease residual values 
we have partially guaranteed our tractor lessors that they will recover those residuals when the leases mature 
at december   the amount of our obligations to lessors for these residuals did not exceed the amount we expect to recover from the manufacturer 
because our lease payments and residual guarantees do not cover more than of the leased tractor s cost  the leases are accounted for as operating leases and rentals are recorded as rent expense over the term of the leases 
offsetting our lease residual guarantees  when our tractors were originally leased  the tractor manufacturer conditionally agreed to re purchase the tractors at the end of the term of the lease 
the price to be paid by the manufacturer is generally equal to the full amount of the lessor s residual 
when a leased tractor is removed from service  we pay the residual to the lessor and collect the funds from the manufacturer 
most of our million commitment to acquire equipment during relates to tractors 
we expect to lease most of these tractors when they are placed into service 
we also lease a significant portion of our company operated trailers 
because trailer leases generally do not involve guaranteed residuals  the lessor is fully at risk for the end of term value of the asset 
our lease commitments for and beyond include million for rentals of tractors owned by related parties 
because the terms of these leases with related parties are more flexible than those governing tractors we lease from unaffiliated lessors  we pay the related parties a premium over the rentals we pay to unaffiliated lessors 
we also rent  on a month to month basis  certain trailers from the same officers at rates that are generally less than market rate monthly trailer rentals 
depending upon the availability of qualified drivers and the level of customer demand for our services  we may add between and tractors to our company operated fleet during in addition  approximately of our oldest tractors  presently scheduled for retirement during  are expected to be replaced 
these expenditures will be financed with internally generated funds  borrowings under available credit agreements and leasing 
we expect these sources of capital to be sufficient to finance our operations 
off balance sheet transactions our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
like many other trucking companies  we often utilize non cancelable operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment acquisitions 
at december   we leased  tractors and  trailers under operating leases with varying termination dates ranging from january to december vehicles held under operating leases are not carried on our balance sheet  and lease payments for such vehicles are reflected in our income statements in the line item revenue equipment rent expense 
our rental expense related to operating leases was million in both and other we own a life insurance policy with a death benefit of more than million on the life of one of our founding shareholders 
we were founded in we paid annual premiums of million during each of the last eleven years  and it has not been determined what premiums may need to be paid in the future 
the policy s cash surrender value of million as of december  is included in other assets on our balance sheet 
in the event that a benefit becomes payable under the policy  we would record as income the difference between the benefit and the cash surrender value 
during  we received an offer from a potential purchaser of the policy  who offered to pay us about million dollars more than the policy s cash surrender value 
after careful consideration of the offer  we decided not to accept it 
we will continue to evaluate such alternatives should they arise in the future

as of december   the trust held about  shares of our stock 
to the extent that trust assets are invested in our stock  our future compensation expense and pre tax income will reflect changes in the market value of our stock 
we own life insurance policies that have cash surrender value 
the investment returns earned by the insurance company serve to pay insurance costs and alter cash surrender value  which is the key determinant of the amount that we could receive pursuant to the policies as of the date of our financial statements 
accordingly  changes in the market value of and returns from those investments could impact the value of our life insurance policies 
changes in those values directly impact the level of our pre tax and net income
