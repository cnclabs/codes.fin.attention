table of contents power  process  environmental and infrastructure industries 
we intend to execute this strategy by aggressively pursuing the following opportunities pursue growth opportunities for our environmental business environmental liability solutions traditionally  owners of contaminated property have been liable for the clean up of the properties and other damages under environmental and tort law 
recently  innovative contracting practices and environmental insurance products have allowed property owners to outsource environmental management and transfer certain liabilities to contractors and insurers 
these clients can reduce administrative expense and time through such outsourcing  and can obtain cost certainty through guaranteed fixed price gfp contracts 
growing trends exist for these kinds of contracts in both our commercial and federal markets 
during fiscal  we were awarded several indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts by the us department of defense dod that were primarily fixed price remediation with insurance fpri type contracts 
we have been awarded three projects totaling approximately million  and we continue to see new projects from these fpri contracts 
in addition  we have approximately million in backlog related to two idiq projects as of august  we also had four other contracts where fpri scopes were included in the contract award 
we are seeing more of the dod agencies moving in this direction for project delivery  and this may represent a significant opportunity for us and we believe we can minimize our exposure for loss through appropriate contract negotiation and insurance coverage 
we have created the shaw insured environmental liability distribution or shield sm program  a proprietary structured transaction tool that insures and distributes environmental liabilities for parties desiring to substantially reduce contingent environmental liabilities 
we believe our experience in managing environmental liabilities and environmental related insurance products will enhance margins and improve our win rates in our core environmental contracting business for both the federal and commercial sectors 
department of energy doe the opportunity in the doe market remains large with a budget increasing from approximately billion in fiscal to approximately billion in fiscal however  we have experienced changes in the doe acquisition strategies to address environmental cleanup of the nuclear weapons complex and changes in their approach for addressing future energy needs 
at the same time the existing prime doe contractors have changed their subcontracting strategies and their view of us as a serious competitor 
we are seeing fewer opportunities and those we do see often have higher business risk and more restrictive terms and conditions 
in general  project revenues from our historical sources  the doe prime contractors  have declined over the last two years 
we anticipate this trend to continue into the future 
revenue in this market increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we made significant changes in fiscal to our strategic approach for capturing an increased doe prime contract market share over the next three to five years 
our general approach to bidding future work to the doe prime contractors is to selectively target those sites that offer us a more favorable bidding environment 
for the doe environmental work  we have experienced a push to significantly increase small business subcontracting direct to doe  a focus on incentive based site closure and accelerated clean up  and the carving out of the cleanup scope at sites across the complex 
our approach to this doe environmental market is to participate in the small business initiatives with our sba approved a joint venture company created with portage environmental  and to bid on other full and open site closure projects as a prime contractor or significant member of a business team 
the business risk on these doe cost plus incentive fee contracts remains low with the biggest risk to us resulting from investment of relatively large bid and proposal efforts  typically costing more than million for a major procurement 
in fiscal  we focused on five major doe procurements  three of which were large contract value small business set asides  one major closure contract  and one doe national laboratory management contract 
the potential value of these five contracts to us is billion over the next five years  but competition is significant 
we will continue to pursue projects within the doe environmental management segment  as well as build off of our nuclear engineering  construction and maintenance capabilities to support the evolving nuclear energy and non proliferation missions of the doe 
unexploded ordnance and explosives  or uxo the dod s fiscal requirements for conventional ordnance and explosives clean up on closed ranges will exceed current government funding  which we estimate to be million annually 
several congressional advocates continue to push for increased 
table of contents funding for uxo removal projects along with developing an enhanced military munitions response program 
we have encountered opportunities through our existing contracts for projects involving uxo as well as indications that there will be new contracts for uxo in the near future 
we intend to pursue opportunities related to the uxo removal projects 
in addition  we had revenue of million and million from these removal projects  respectively 
during fiscal  we were awarded million in uxo type idiq contracts 
we expect this growth trend to continue as the dod addresses operational and non operational ranges under the military munitions response program 
coastal and natural resource restoration we have performed wetland related work in the everglades  chesapeake bay area  and other areas throughout the united states  and we maintain the expertise and resources to continue to benefit from this expanding segment 
new opportunities are present in both the federal and commercial markets for these types of projects 
for example  the coastal wetlands planning protection and restoration act provides federal funds to conserve  restore and create coastal wetlands and barrier islands 
we believe our e i segment is well positioned to capitalize on upcoming wetlands and coastal restoration work in louisiana and other locations throughout the united states 
pursue growth opportunities for our infrastructure business privatization for the past couple of years  the department of defense dod has moved to privatization of military housing and utility systems consisting of more than  family housing units owned by the dod  of which approximately need to be renovated or replaced 
since fiscal  we have been awarded two contracts by the dod to privatize military family housing for approximately  military family housing units with our joint venture partner  cei investment corp 
cei 
the total estimated development cost for these two contracts is approximately million 
we have also been notified that we have been awarded five additional contracts to privatize military family housing  however  these contracts had not yet closed as of august  these contracts have estimated development costs of approximately billion for the privatization of approximately  military family housing units 
we believe that several factors  including i our federal government business platform  ii prior dod facilities management and job order contracting and other governmental contracting experience  and iii expertise in construction at military installations  contributed to these contracts being awarded to us 
homeland security federal  state and local homeland security needs continue to provide initial and value added opportunities for our e i segment to capitalize on growing experience in disaster related preparedness  incident response  mitigation design and installation and chemical and biological weapons demilitarization

plant restarts are currently taking place in the us and canada while new plant construction is ongoing in certain foreign countries and should occur in the us in the future 
this market is estimated at million per year 
during fiscal  we were awarded contracts totaling more than million 
our subsidiary  stone webster is well known for its strengths in the design of new nuclear facilities and the related technical services 
flue gas desulphurization fgd environmental regulations and the rising price of natural gas have fueled the need to retrofit existing coal fired power plants 
during fiscal  we were awarded engineering contracts on projects totaling more than million 
we believe we are well positioned and qualified to perform the epc on these and other fgd projects 
the fgd retrofit market is roughly a to billion market that will continue to grow through  assuming the epa will pass clean air regulation 
we will continue to seek new opportunities in this area and believe our unique and recent experience in engineering and managing these projects will make us an early industry leader in this market 
coal the sharp rise in oil prices has prompted regulated power companies in the united states to focus on coal fired plants 
while the number of new plants in the future is an uncertainty  the general consensus is that some awards of coal plants will be made in fiscal our stone webster subsidiaries have the experience and expertise related to these coal plants which should position us for a share of this market 
gas fired generating capacity expansion of new gas generation capacity will be limited in the united states market  but the international market  including canada  is expected to become increasingly active 
some growth in the united states is expected to be driven by distribution rather than capacity as evidenced by two generating plants awarded to us during fiscal totaling more than million in contract value which are currently under construction 
select opportunities to potentially complete construction on existing and partially completed combined cycle plants throughout the united states exist in the market 
additionally  general proposals are in preparation for international projects in fiscal our integrated capabilities and recent experience bodes well for success in what will be a competitive market

we are a diverse  worldwide business group able to provide our clients with reliability services  turnarounds outages  small project capital construction services  tank design construction maintenance  insulation  painting  scaffolding  and water and wastewater operation and maintenance o m 
our plant and reliability engineering  as well as our maintenance expertise  combine to assist our clients in the improvement of power production and compliance with federal environmental requirements 
nuclear  fgd  coal and gas fired generation opportunities in the market will provide the best power growth opportunities for our maintenance services in fiscal year nuclear plant maintenance and modifications we are currently providing nuclear maintenance services in of the operating nuclear plants in the united states and decommissioning services at two plants 
potential opportunities include expansion to other us plants and the expansion of our services within the existing plants 
this market is estimated at million per year 
during fiscal  we were awarded 
table of contents contracts totaling more than million 
our subsidiary  stone webster has performed nuclear plant maintenance modification services for over years and has the largest market share in the united states 
fabrication manufacturing piping nuclear maintenance  fgd projects  new coal plants and retrofits  new gas plants  and general plant maintenance all require pipe fabrication which our group can provide 
a typical new power plant will result in multiple subcontracts which all include pipe fabrication 
the fabrication and manufacturing group generally participates in some way on each new plant being built in the u 
s 
market and many being built internationally 
the participation is not limited to shaw business units 
we expect the most growth opportunities in the power market for piping to occur domestically in the coal market  both new coal plants and retrofits 
pursue growth opportunities for the process market shaw provides a variety of services to process industries and we are focusing on efforts in both domestic and international opportunities 
opportunities for our services in the processes industries market include engineering  procurement and construction epc  maintenance  and fabrication manufacturing opportunities 
engineering  procurement construction proprietary technologies within the process industries 
we offer world class proprietary technologies to the refining and petrochemical industries 
our fiscal acquisition of badger technologies demonstrates our commitment to expand our technology portfolio and maintain a leadership position in process technologies 
the acquisition of badger complements our core competency in conversion technologies steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking by enabling us to offer several key olefin derivative technologies 
in particular  we are now able to license world leading technologies to produce ethyl benzene and cumene through badger licensing llc  a joint venture of stone webster and exxonmobil chemical 
we are also able to offer badger styrene monomer technology in cooperation with atofina 
by providing world class proprietary technologies  we are able to capitalize on the combined strengths of shaw and our partners to offer our clients an optimum business solution 
we expect to continue to expand our technology portfolio through key alliance partners and research and development efforts 
clean fuels we were awarded approximately million of clean fuel emissions work in fiscal and approximately million in early fiscal we currently have five active clean fuels projects 
we believe this market will continue to expand for us into fiscal as we have demonstrated the ability to win and execute work in this area 
ethylene the demand for ethylene is growing at a rate of to per year times gdp growth 
approximately of ethylene is produced from petroleum derived naphtha but this is changing due to the availability of low cost ethane feedstock in the middle east region 
this feedstock cost advantage has seriously impacted the economic viability of gas feed steam crackers in north america where feedstock price is controlled by natural gas pricing 
new facilities will mainly be gas feed crackers based on ethane extracted from nature gas 
the expansion in ethylene demand is being driven by the increased demand for polyethylene  polyesters  polystyrene and pvc  mainly from china 
we anticipate this increase to continue into fiscal we are currently bidding on ten major ethylene projects in the middle east and china with additional projects in the planning stage 
with our estimated of the all ready existing market share and only four ethylene technology licensor competitors  our stone webster subsidiaries are well positioned to seize these opportunities 
petrochemical refinery the refining industry is searching for new value added projects that can be produced from petroleum  and are investigating integration into petrochemical facilities 
we have an exclusive agreement with ripp sinopec to license a key technology that encourages the refiner s entry into the petrochemical arena 
this technology is a high olefin yield  fluid catalytic cracker derived process called deep catalytic cracking dcc 
this technology is of increasing interest because of its ability to produce propylene  a base chemical that is in short supply and whose demand is growing faster than that of ethylene 
the petrochemical industry is concerned about the future supply of propylene 
this is due to the predominant increase in ethane crackers which produce ethylene and minimal amounts of propylene which 
table of contents leads to the increased interest in dcc 
we have just licensed a large dcc unit to a confidential client and are in discussions with several other potential clients 
we believe growth opportunities in the process market for petrochemical refineries exist in retrofit projects domestically and new construction and expansion projects internationally 
maintenance process maintenance shaw maintenance began as primarily a process focused business and has diversified into all phases of the industrial market 
we strive to be safety driven with proactive programs and world class results 
shaw maintenance holds diverse capabilities to service our client s needs 
we perform design  repair  renovation  and preventative services to customer facilities worldwide 
shaw maintenance is positioned to assist the process industry by providing capabilities in conjunction with our epc services 
petrochemical  ethylene and clean fuels markets will provide the best process growth opportunities for our maintenance services in fiscal year fabrication manufacturing piping shaw fabrication and manufacturing has completed a substantial portion of the pipe fabrication for the clean fuels initiatives taking place in the us market 
alliances with major refinery owners as well as alliances with many of the epc companies involved in clean fuels projects have resulted in extensive work experience and backlog for our group 
shaw s inventory levels  fabrication expertise and capacity  and innovative material supply programs have led to the bulk of these bookings 
the material market is the most challenging it has been in recent history due to the explosive expansion of the asian market 
not only has the fabrication portion of our business benefited  but our manufacturing arm has seen tremendous benefits from this market 
in addition to clean fuels  new plants utilizing proprietary technologies provide tremendous fabrication opportunities 
we expect our growth opportunities for the process market in piping to occur internationally as ethylene and petrochemical refinery opportunities occur 
maintain a diversified revenue base 
we intend to continue to maintain our diversity in markets served  services offered  contracting arrangements and customer base 
this diversity has helped us to minimize our dependence on any particular market segment or individual customer  minimize the impact of short term market volatility and has enabled us to more accurately anticipate future revenues 
our presence across numerous markets allows us to focus our resources on those areas experiencing growth 
in addition  our presence allows us to allocate our resources efficiently within and across our segments 
with the it group acquisition in fiscal  we further diversified our business mix which provided a recurring revenue base 
many of our environmental and infrastructure businesses  along with our existing ecm maintenance services  tend to provide recurring revenues due to established customer contracts 
however  a significant portion of our revenue is generated from services provided to various us government agencies under separate contracts 
for the years ended august   and  revenues from these us government agencies were  million  million and million  respectively 
maintain focus on cost reimbursable and negotiated fixed price contract structures 
our strategy is to perform most of our engineering  procurement and construction projects pursuant to cost reimbursable contracts in which our contractual loss exposure is limited to our gross profit 
these contracts often contain incentive sharing penalty provisions for performance  cost control  and delivery of products and services 
we intend to continue our contracting practices to minimize our risk of contractual losses while providing incentives for us and our customers to work cooperatively 
as of august   approximately of our contracts included in our backlog are cost reimbursable contracts  are fixed price contracts and are unit price contracts 
in the current domestic power market and our expanded environmental and infrastructure services to various us government agencies  our customers are increasingly requesting fixed price contracts 
we prefer to selectively pursue such fixed price contracts whenever possible on a negotiated basis in situations where we believe we can control our cost and minimize our risks 
for example  in september  we signed and announced an epc contract to build a combined cycle power plant in queens  new york  which is a million fixed price contract 
generally  fixed priced contracts are priced with a higher margin than cost reimbursable contracts in order to compensate for cost overrun risk 
continue to form strategic alliances 
we intend to continue to capitalize upon and enter into strategic partnerships and alliances with our customers 
our alliance and partnership agreements enhance our ability to obtain 
table of contents contracts for individual projects by eliminating or reducing formal bid preparation 
we continue to pursue these strategic partnerships and alliances in an attempt to increase our market share within our existing markets and assist us in entering into new markets 
we will also continue to look to expand our operations where we see the potential for attractive and profitable business opportunities and can leverage the local knowledge of an alliance or joint venture partner 
for example  shaw e i has a partnership with cei related to seven military housing privatization projects 
cei s experience in property management along with our engineering and construction management experience has allowed us to obtain a portion of this market share 
additionally  within our facilities management activities  we continue to pursue strategic alliances like our partnership with computer sciences corporation to provide facilities management services to nasa s stennis space center 
capitalize on opportunities for cross selling 
we have several complementary areas of expertise we will leverage to deliver increased value to our customers 
our engineering  design and construction expertise allows us to provide retrofitting and construction services to our facilities maintenance customers such as the tennessee valley authority  or tva 
in addition  we expect the capabilities of our e i segment to allow us to offer specialized environmental remediation  facilities management and maintenance services to our clients in the power and process industries 
as a result  our combined business now enables us to offer complete service offerings  from design through construction to ongoing maintenance and management  across a variety of industries 
pursue selective acquisitions 
we intend to continue to pursue selective acquisitions of businesses or assets that will expand  complement or further diversify our current portfolio of products and services 
upon execution of our effective and thorough due diligence procedures led by our senior executives who became involved early in the acquisition process  we believe we have efficiently enhanced our existing services through our successful strategic acquisitions 
for example  effective december   we acquired all of the common stock of energy delivery services  inc shaw eds from duke energy global markets  inc which provides a full line of vertical services to utility companies seeking to upgrade  install and maintain their power grids and is vertically integrated in our ecm segment 
from time to time  we may also consider dispositions of non strategic assets 
utilize technology and intellectual property 
we intend to continue to employ our technology and intellectual property to reduce costs and to better serve our customers 
our technologies include induction pipe bending technology 
we believe our induction pipe bending technology is one of the most advanced  sophisticated  and efficient technologies available 
induction bending utilizes simultaneous super heating and compression of pipe to produce tight radius bends to a customer s specifications 
when compared to the traditional cut and weld method  our induction bending technology provides a lower cost and more uniform product  generally considered stronger and less prone to structural fatigue 
proprietary ethylene and downstream petrochemical technologies 
we believe we have a leading position in technologies associated with the process design of plants that produce ethylene 
we estimate we have supplied process technology for approximately of the world s ethylene capacity constructed since technology partnerships 
we have been awarded of the last residual feed fluid catalytic cracking projects and have combined the best elements of fluid catalytic cracking technology from different developers into a single source that is among the best in the industry 
our partners include total  axens  spraying systems  bp and ripp 
we also offer the only commercially demonstrated high olefin production catalytic cracking technology through our exclusive licensing agreement with ripp sinopec 
proprietary customer focused computer software 
we have developed proprietary computer software to aid in project and process management 
this software includes shaw man and other software programs which enhance a customer s ability to plan  schedule and track projects and reduce installation costs and cycle times 
shawtrac which is a web based  proprietary earned value application that enables us to

our services also include providing risk assessment and engineering and logistical support  as well as playing a leading role in investigating  developing and testing innovative decontamination techniques to help minimize and eliminate such contamination 
nuclear services a significant portion of future dod and doe environmental expenditures will be directed to cleaning up hundreds of domestic and international military bases and to restoring former nuclear weapons facilities 
the dod has stated there is a need to ensure that the hazardous wastes present at these sites  often located near population centers  do not pose a threat to the surrounding population 
further  in connection with the closure of many military bases  there are economic incentives and benefits resulting from environmental restoration that enable these sites to be developed commercially by the private sector 
the doe has long recognized the need to stabilize and safely store nuclear weapons materials and to clean up areas contaminated with hazardous and radioactive waste 
we continue to provide engineering and project leadership support to other doe nuclear programs such as mixed oxide fuel and yucca mountain 
environmental liability solutions the dod has stated its intent to increase the use of performance based contracts  including guaranteed fixed price with environmental insurance vehicles 
during fiscal  we were awarded several idiq contracts by the dod that were primarily fpri type contracts 
we have been awarded three projects totaling approximately million and we continue to see new projects from these fpri contracts 
in addition  we have approximately million in backlog related to two idiq projects as of august  we have also created the shaw insured environmental liability distribution or shield program  a proprietary structured transaction tool that insures and distributes environmental liabilities for parties desiring to substantially reduce contingent environmental liabilities

the total estimated development costs for these two contracts is approximately million 
additionally  we have been notified that we have been awarded five additional contracts to privatize military family housing  however  these contracts had not yet closed as of august  these contracts have estimated development costs of approximately billion for the privatization of approximately  military family housing units 
we believe several factors  including i our federal government business platform  ii prior dod facilities management and job order contracting and other governmental contracting experience  and iii expertise in construction at military installations contributed to these contracts being awarded to us 
engineering  construction maintenance segment the ecm segment provides a range of project related services  including design  engineering  construction  procurement  maintenance  technology and consulting services  primarily to the power generation and process industries 
industry overview power generation industry we provide a full range of engineering  procurement and construction services to power projects on a global basis 
during fiscal  our backlog increased significantly as a result of demand for new power plants  primarily 
table of contents combined cycle and combustion turbine technology fueled by natural gas or both oil and gas 
this new capacity demand was primarily created by orders from independent power producers and merchant power plants to develop additional generation capacity 
typically  new plants from independent and merchant power producers compete directly with existing utilities in deregulated sectors 
deregulation also created opportunities for us from existing utilities that needed to upgrade or develop new power plants to remain competitive 
although demand for new power plants decreased significantly in fiscal and fiscal  we expect that in the coming years many existing plants will need to be re powered or substantially upgraded by replacing all or most of the existing equipment with more efficient systems 
during fiscal  we were awarded two contracts for new construction gas fired power generation projects for a combined contract price of approximately million 
we also provide system wide maintenance and modification services to existing power plants 
these projects can include upgrading emission control systems and redesigning facilities to allow for the use of alternative fuels 
we concentrate on more complicated  non commodity type projects where our technology  historical know how and project management skills can add value to the project 
we believe we have a leading position in the decommissioning and decontamination business for nuclear power plants 
this business consists of shutting down and safely removing a facility from service while reducing the residual radioactivity to a level that permits release of the property for unrestricted use and termination of the nuclear power plant license 
process industry our process work includes work for customers primarily in the chemical  petrochemical and refining industries 
demand in processing industries has declined in recent years as a result of decreased spending by chemical  petrochemical and refining companies and  more recently  due to an overall downturn in the worldwide economy 
however  we are encouraged by an increase in inquiry activity in the petrochemical and refining industries  especially in the overseas markets 
key drivers include an increased demand for ethylene and downstream petrochemical products as well as waste to energy opportunities 
we believe there will be increased capital expenditures by the major oil and petrochemical companies in calendar internationally  china continues to significantly expand its petrochemical capabilities 
critical to this expansion is additional ethylene capacity which is one of our core competencies 
we also expect new petrochemical opportunities in the oil producing regions due to the higher than expected crude oil prices and the availability of lower priced natural gas in the middle east 
this is particularly true in the kingdom of saudi arabia where the oil refining industry is beginning to expand into petrochemicals 
we expect that actions by the major oil and petrochemical companies to integrate refining and petrochemical facilities in order to improve margins will provide opportunities for us 
in the petrochemical field  we have particular expertise in the construction of ethylene plants which convert gas and or liquid hydrocarbon feed stocks into ethylene  the source of many higher value chemical products  including packaging  pipes  polyester  antifreeze  electronics  tires and tubes 
the demand for our services in the refining industry has been driven by refiners needs to process a broader spectrum of crude and to produce a greater number of products 
in addition  current refining activity is being driven by demand for clean fuels and clean air legislation 
while the refining process is largely a commodity activity  the configuration of each refinery depends primarily on the grade of crude feedstock available  desired mix of end products and considerations of capital and operating costs 
we also undertake related work in the gas processing field  including propane dehydrogenation facilities  gas treatment facilities  liquefied natural gas plants and cryogenic processes 
services offered engineering and design we provide a broad range of engineering  design and design related services to our customers 
our engineering capabilities include civil  structural  mechanical  and electrical 
for each project  we identify the project requirements and then integrate and coordinate the various design elements 
other critical tasks in the design process may include value analysis and the assessment of construction and maintenance requirements 
construction  procurement and maintenance 
table of contents we provide construction and construction management services 
we often manage the procurement of materials  subcontractors and craft labor 
we believe we have significant expertise in effectively and efficiently managing these activities  vendors and labor 
depending on the project  we may function as the primary contractor or as a subcontractor to another firm or as a construction manager  engaged by the customer to oversee another contractor s compliance with design specifications and contracting terms 
under operation and maintenance contracts  we perform repair  renovation  predictive and preventative services to customers in their facilities worldwide 
consulting we provide technical and economic analysis and recommendations to owners  investors  developers  operators and governments  primarily in the global power generation industry 
our services include competitive market valuations  asset valuations  assessment of stranded costs  plant technical descriptions and energy demand modeling 
we have particular expertise in the electronic simulation and analysis of power transmission and distribution systems 
technology our world class proprietary olefin and refinery technologies  coupled with the badger alliances  allow us to offer clients an integrated refinery and petrochemicals solution 
the combined stone webster badger team  in conjunction with key alliance partners  offers leading technology in many sectors of the refining and petrochemical industry 
fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment the fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment provides integrated piping systems and services for new construction  site expansion and retrofit projects for industrial plants and manufactures 
we believe we are the largest supplier of fabricated piping systems for power generation facilities in the united states and a leading supplier worldwide 
in process facilities  piping systems are the critical path to convert raw or feedstock materials to products 
we fabricate fully integrated piping systems and provide a full range of engineering  procurement and construction services for process customers around the world 
piping system integration accounts for a significant portion of the total man hours associated with constructing a power generation or a materials processing facility 
we provide fabrication of complex piping systems from raw materials including carbon steel  stainless steel and other alloys  such as nickel  titanium and aluminum 
we fabricate pipe by cutting it to length  welding fittings on the pipe and bending the pipe  each to precise customer specifications 
we currently operate pipe fabrication facilities in louisiana  south carolina  utah  oklahoma where operations have been substantially reduced as a result of decreased demand  the united kingdom  venezuela our pipe fabrication facility was closed due to political unrest during  and two joint ventures bahrain and china 
our fabrication facilities are capable of fabricating pipe ranging in diameter from inch to inches  with overall wall thicknesses from inch to inches 
we can fabricate pipe assemblies up to feet in length and weighing up to tons 
we believe our induction pipe bending technology is one of the most advanced  sophisticated  and efficient technologies available  and we utilize this technology and related equipment to bend pipe and other carbon steel and alloy items for industrial  commercial and architectural applications 
pipe bending can provide significant savings in labor  time and material costs  as well as product strengthening 
in addition  we have commenced a robotics program which we believe will result in productivity and quality levels not previously attained in this industry 
as of august   the robotics program is currently being tested in production 
we operate a manufacturing facility in shreveport  louisiana  which sells its products to our ecm segment s operations and to third parties 
manufacturing our own pipe fittings enables shaw to realize greater efficiencies in the purchase of raw materials  reduces overall lead times and lowers total installed costs 
we also operate several distribution centers in the us  which distribute our products and products manufactured by third parties 
demand for the segment s products is typically dependent upon capital projects in the power generation and process industries 

table of contents segment financial data and export sale information see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for detailed financial information regarding each business segment and export sales information 
revenues by industry and geographic region our revenues by industry in our three most recent fiscal years approximated the following amounts year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions in millions environmental and infrastructure power generation process industries other industries process industries include chemical and petrochemical processing and crude oil refining sales 
other industries includes the oil and gas exploration and production industry as well as various fabrication distribution customers 
the major industries in which we operate are cyclical 
because our customers typically participate in a broad portfolio of industries  our experience has been that downturns in one industry sector may be mitigated  in part  by opportunities in another sector 
our revenues by geographic region in our three most recent fiscal years approximated the following amounts year ended august  geographic region in millions in millions in millions united states asia pacific rim middle east europe canada south america and mexico other 
table of contents backlog the following table breaks out backlog in the following industry sectors  geographic regions and business segments for the periods indicated 
at august  in millions in millions in millions industry sector environmental infrastructure power generation process industries other industries geographic region domestic international business segments e i ecm fabrication  manufacturing and distribution we estimate that approximately of our backlog at august  will be completed in fiscal our backlog is largely a reflection of the broader economic trends being experienced by our customers and is important to us in anticipating our operational needs 
backlog is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles and our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog 
we cannot assure you that revenues projected in our backlog will be realized  or if realized  will result in profits 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
e i segment our e i segment s backlog includes the value of awarded contracts and the estimated value of unfunded work of our consolidated subsidiaries and our proportionately consolidated joint venture entities 
the unfunded backlog generally represents various government federal  state and local project awards for which the project funding has been at least partially authorized or awarded by the relevant government authorities eg  authorization or an award has been provided for only the initial year or two of a multi year project 
because of appropriation limitations in the governmental budget processes  firm funding is usually made for only one year at a time  and  in some cases  for periods less than one year  with the remainder of the years under the contract expressed as a series of one year options 
amounts included in backlog are based on the contract s total awarded value and our estimates regarding the amount of the award that will ultimately result in the recognition of revenue 
these estimates are based on our experience with similar awards and similar customers and average approximately of the total unfunded awards 
estimates are reviewed periodically and appropriate adjustments are made to the amounts included in backlog and in unexercised contract options 
our backlog does not include any awards funded or unfunded for work expected to be performed more than five years after the date of our financial statements 
the amount of future actual awards may be more or less than our estimates 
ecm segment we define our backlog in the ecm segment to include projects for which we have received a commitment from our customers of our consolidated subsidiaries and proportionately consolidated joint venture entities 
this commitment typically takes the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order  or a specific indication of the amount of time or material we need to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
certain backlog engagements are for particular products or projects for which we estimate anticipated revenue  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
our backlog for maintenance work is derived from maintenance contracts and our customers historic maintenance requirements 

table of contents fabrication  manufacturing distribution we define our backlog in this segment to include projects for which we have received a commitment from our customers 
this commitment typically takes the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order  or a specific indication of the amount of time or material we need to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
many of the contracts in backlog provide for cancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects 
these cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out of pocket costs  revenue associated with work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed 
types of contracts our work is performed under fixed price contracts  cost reimbursable contracts  and fixed price and cost reimbursable contracts modified by incentive and penalty provisions 
each of our contracts may contain components of more than one of the contract types discussed below 
during the term of a project  the contract or components of the contract may be renegotiated to a different contract type 
we focus our engineering  procurement and construction activities on cost reimbursable  as defined below  and negotiated fixed price work 
we believe these types of contracts reduce our exposure to unanticipated and unrecoverable cost overruns 
fixed price contracts are generally obtained by direct negotiation rather than by competitive bid 
we have entered into fixed price or unit price contracts on a significant number of our domestic piping contracts and substantially all of our international piping projects 
at august   approximately of our backlog was comprised of cost reimbursable contracts  were fixed price contracts and were unit price contracts 
our fixed price contracts include the following firm fixed price contract a contract in which the price is not subject to any adjustment by reason of our cost experience or our performance under the contract 
as a result  we benefit from costs savings while generally being unable to recover any cost overruns on these contracts 
however  these contract prices may be adjusted for changes in scope of work  new or changing laws and regulations and other events negotiated 
these fixed price contracts usually require that we use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time  otherwise  we could be assessed damages which in some cases are limited to agreed upon liquidated damages 
maximum price contract a contract which provides at the outset for an initial target cost  an initial target profit  and a price ceiling 
the price is subject to adjustment by reason of our cost experience  but the adjustment would generally not exceed the price ceiling established in the contract 
in addition  these contracts usually include provisions whereby we share cost savings with our clients 
as a result  we partially benefit from cost savings while we generally are unable to recover any cost overruns in excess of the ceiling price 
unit price contract a contract under which we are paid a specified amount for every unit of work performed 
a unit price contract is essentially a firm fixed price contract with the only variable being units of work performed 
variations in unit price contracts include the same type of variations as firm fixed price contracts 
we are normally awarded these contracts on the basis of a total price that is the sum of the product of the specified units and unit prices 
our cost reimbursable contracts include the following cost plus contract a contract under which we are reimbursed for allowable or otherwise defined costs incurred plus a fee or mark up 
these contracts usually require that we use our best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time  otherwise  we could be held liable for damages which in some cases are limited to agreed upon liquidated damages 
the contracts may also include incentives for various performance criteria including areas as quality  timeliness  ingenuity  safety and cost effectiveness 
in addition  our costs are generally subject to review by our customers and such reviews could result in costs being disputed as not reimbursable under the terms of the contract 
target price contract a contract under which we are reimbursed for costs plus a fee consisting of two parts i a fixed amount which does not vary with performance and ii an award amount based on the 
table of contents performance and cost effectiveness of the project 
as a result  we are generally able to recover any cost overruns on these contracts  however  we can be assessed liquidated or actual damages for late delivery or the failure to meet certain performance criteria 
target price contracts also generally provide for sharing of costs in excess of or below the target 
in some contracts  we may agree to share cost overruns in excess of our fee which could result in a loss on the project 
us government contracts are typically awarded through competitive bidding or negotiations pursuant to federal acquisition regulations and may involve several bidders or offerors 
government contracts also typically have annual funding limitations and are limited by public sector budgeting constraints 
government contracts may be terminated at the discretion of the government agency with payment of compensation only for work performed and commitments made at the time of termination 
in the event of termination  we generally receive some allowance for profit on the work performed 
many of these contracts are multi year indefinite delivery order agreements 
these programs provide estimates of a maximum amount the agency expects to spend 
our program management and technical staffs work closely with the client to define the scope and amount of work required 
although these contracts do not initially provide us with any specific amount of work  as projects are defined  the work may be awarded to us without further competitive bidding 
although we generally serve as the prime contractor on our federal government contracts  or as part of a joint venture which is the prime contractor  we also serve as a subcontractor to other prime contractors 
with respect to bidding on large  complex environmental contracts  we have entered into and may continue to enter into joint venture or teaming arrangements with competitors 
also  us government contracts generally are subject to oversight audits by government representatives  to profit and cost controls and limitations  and to provisions permitting modification or termination  in whole or in part  without prior notice  at the government s convenience 
government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socio economic and other requirements 
failure to comply with such regulations and requirements could lead to suspension or debarment  for cause  from future government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes  including those related to employment practices  the protection of the environment  the accuracy of records and the recording of costs 
our continuing service agreements with customers expedite individual project contract negotiations through means other than the formal bidding process 
these agreements typically contain a standardized set of purchasing terms and pre negotiated pricing provisions and often provide for periodic price adjustments 
service agreements allow our customers to achieve greater cost efficiencies and reduced cycle times in the design and fabrication of complex piping systems for power  chemical and refinery projects 
in addition  while these agreements do not typically contain committed volumes  we believe that these agreements provide us with a steady source of new projects and help minimize the impact of short term pricing volatility 
customers and marketing our customers are principally major multi national industrial corporations  regulated utilities  independent and merchant power providers  governmental agencies and equipment manufacturers 
for the year ended august   we had revenues from seven customers of approximately million  which represented approximately of our ecm segment s revenues and of our total revenues 
we also had total revenues from us government agencies or entities owned by the us government of approximately  million of our total revenues that included e i segment revenues totaling approximately million of e i segment revenues 
additionally  as of august   approximately of our total backlog  and approximately of the e i segment s backlog is with u 
s government agencies or entities owned by the us government 
contracts with seven separate commercial customers of the ecm segment represent approximately of total backlog and of ecm backlog at august  
table of contents for the year ended august   we had revenues from entities owned or controlled by pg e national energy group  inc of approximately million  which represented approximately of our ecm segment s revenues and of our total revenues 
also  we had total revenues from us government agencies or entities owned by the us government of approximately million of our total revenues that included e i segment revenues totaling approximately million of e i segment revenues 
we conduct our marketing efforts principally with an in house sales force 
in addition  we engage independent contractors as agents to market to certain customers and territories 
we pay our sales force a base salary plus  when applicable  an annual bonus 
we pay our independent contractors on a commission basis which may also include a monthly retainer 
raw materials and suppliers for our engineering  procurement and construction services  we often rely on third party equipment manufacturers and subcontractors to complete our projects 
we are not substantially dependent on any individual third party to support these operations  however  we are subject to possible cost escalations based on inflation and other market price fluctuations 
our principal raw materials for our pipe fabrication operations are carbon steel  stainless steel and other alloy piping  which we obtain from a number of domestic and foreign primary steel producers 
the market for most raw materials is extremely competitive  and our relationships with suppliers are strong 
certain types of raw materials  however  are available from only one or a few specialized suppliers 
our inability to obtain materials from these suppliers could jeopardize our ability to timely complete a project or realize a profit 
we purchase directly from manufacturers  or manufacture  a majority of our pipe fittings 
these arrangements generally lower our pipe fabrication costs because we are often able to negotiate advantageous purchase prices as a result of the volumes of our purchases 
if a manufacturer is unable to deliver the materials according to the negotiated terms  we may be required to purchase the materials from another source at a higher price 
we keep items in stock at each of our facilities and transport items between our facilities as required 
we obtain more specialized materials from suppliers when required for a project 
industry certifications in order to perform fabrication and repairs of coded piping systems  our domestic construction operations and fabrication facilities  as well as our subsidiaries in derby  uk and maracaibo  venezuela  maintain the required american society of mechanical engineers asme certification u pp stamps 
the majority of our fabrication facilities  as well as our subsidiaries  in derby  uk and maracaibo  venezuela have also obtained the required asme certification s stamp and the national board certification r stamp 
our domestic subsidiary engineering and construction operations in stoughton  massachusetts also maintain the required asme certification s stamp and the national board repair certification r stamp in addition to the asme certifications a  pp  u stamps and the national board registration certification nb stamp for s  a  pp  and u stamped items

stoughton  massachusetts also maintains the national board nuclear repair certification nr stamp and national board registration certification nb stamp for n n stamped nuclear components 
the laurens  south carolina facility also maintains a nuclear piping asme certification npt stamp and is authorized to fabricate piping for nuclear power plants and to serve as a material organization to manufacture and supply ferrous and nonferrous material 
this facility is also registered by the international organization of standards iso 
substantially all of our north american engineering operations  as well as our uk operations  are also 
table of contents registered by the international organization of standards iso 
patents  trademarks and licenses and other intellectual property we have several items that we believe constitute valuable intellectual property 
we consider our computerized project control system  shaw man  to be a proprietary asset 
we believe that our stone webster subsidiary has a leading position in technology associated with the design and construction of plants that produce ethylene  which we protect and develop with license restrictions and a research and development program 
our power technologies inc pti subsidiary is the owner of a recently issued patent for a line rating monitor  sold as the thermalrate system 
the thermalrate system allows transmission and distribution lines to carry more power while maintaining high reliability and safety 
for lines that thermally limit power flow  the thermalrate system is a cost effective solution which can avoid physical modifications of the lines 
through the acquisition of the badger technologies  we have obtained several technology partnerships 
in the key area of zeolite catalysis  the association with exxonmobil chemical has resulted in the successful development of what we believe to be the world s leading technologies to produce ethyl benzene and cumene  which are available for license through badger licensing llc  our joint venture with exxonmobil chemical 
complementing this relationship in alkylation is the licensing of the fina badger styrene monomer technology  a relationship that has spanned years 
in the area of gas to liquids  we are the exclusive provider of front end basic engineering for sasol s fischer tropsch technologies 
through our acquisition of the assets of the it group  we have acquired certain patents that are useful in environmental remediation and related technologies 
the technologies include the biofast in situ remediation method  a vacuum extraction method for treating contaminated formations  and a method for soil treatment which uses ozone 
the it group acquisition also included the acquisition of proprietary software programs that are used in the management and control of hazardous wastes and the management and oversight of remediation projects 
in fiscal  we acquired envirogen  inc which had certain patents and trademarks 
envirogen s patented technologies include processes for the control of biomass in fluidized bed reactors which processes enhance overall system degradative performance and operating costs  biodegradation of mtbe and other compounds utilizing specialized bacteria and degradative techniques  and designs for membrane biological reactors reducing operating costs and downtime associated with membrane cleaning for water treatment 
competition the markets served by both our ecm and e i segments are highly competitive and for the most part require substantial resources and highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
a large number of regional  national and international companies are competing in the markets we serve  and certain of these competitors have greater financial and other resources 
further  we are a recent entrant into certain areas of these businesses  and certain competitors possess substantially greater experience  market knowledge and customer relationships 
in pursuing piping  engineering and fabrication projects  we experience significant competition in both international and domestic markets 
in the united states  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators  while internationally  our principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of our competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than us 
employees at august   we employed approximately  employees  and approximately of these employees were represented by labor unions pursuant to collective bargaining agreements 
we also employ union labor from time to time on a project specific basis 
we believe current relationships with our employees including those represented by unions are satisfactory 
we are not aware of any circumstances that are likely to result in a work stoppage at any of our facilities 
at august   approximately of our employees work in our wholly owned subsidiaries in canada and in the united kingdom 

table of contents environmental laws and regulations we are subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning emissions into the air  discharges into waterways  generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and health and safety 
the environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of such laws and regulations on us in the future 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
to date  our costs with respect to environmental compliance have not been material  and we have not incurred any material environmental liability 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not incur material environmental costs or liabilities in the future

item legal proceedings neg covert harquahala early in fiscal  we entered into two target price contracts with a customer  pg e national energy group  inc neg  and its project entities  to provide epc services for two gas fired combined cycle power plants in covert  michigan and harquahala valley  arizona 
in october  the parent company of neg  pg e corp 
pg e announced that neg had notified its lenders that it did not intend to make further equity contributions required under the credit facility to fund the covert and harquahala projects 
we believed this notice raised doubt about whether we would continue to be paid for the work we performed under these target price contracts 
in may  after extensive negotiations with neg s project entities  neg  and their lenders  we reached a definitive settlement agreement for settlement of claims existing as of that date related to the covert and harquahala projects 
the settlement provided for fixed price epc contracts which increased the original target price for both projects by a total of million  termination of the target priced components of the original agreements which provided for recovery of costs in excess of the fixed price contracts  dismissal of pending legal proceedings  our release of claims based on existing change orders and the incurrence of additional costs  and the extension of the schedule for completion of the projects 
the revised schedule provided for us to complete the harquahala project in september and the covert project in december neg paid us million in may as a result of this settlement agreement and required us to post a letter of credit in its favor for the same amount which was assigned by them to its lenders 
during fiscal  we recognized a loss of million which includes a million loss recorded in the second quarter of on these two projects  million of which was reversal of profit recognized prior to fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional loss on these two projects of million million of which was reversal of profit recognized prior to fiscal 
approximately million represents actual and estimated increased costs to complete the covert project primarily due to the failure of installed equipment  required rework and vendor and subcontractor delays 
the million loss was net of additional expected claims of approximately million 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a reduction in the gross profit on the harquahala project resulting from a million reduction in our estimated claims recovery and an increase of million in estimated cost of completion related primarily to the duration of our involvement in start up and warranty related activities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we notified the owner of substantial completion on two of the three power island units on covert and communicated that the remaining unit would achieve substantial completion in january 
table of contents we also communicated that the total facility would achieve substantial completion in february we notified the owner of substantial completion on the harquahala facility on december  while we previously demonstrated substantial completion on all six units at the two plants  the owners did not accept our various unit and facility completion dates and continued to assess liquidated damages 
the owners accepted substantial completion of the covert units in january and the harquahala units in march the owners have not accepted facility completion on either project  in part because they believe we must post letters of credit on two projects totaling million as security for warranty work in order to achieve facility completion 
we firmly disagree with this position  and until all outstanding disputes are resolved  we do not intend to post additional letters of credit 
in the meantime  we intend to comply with our warranty obligations 
as of august   the owners have withheld million from milestone payments due us as an offset to liquidated damages they have claimed 
in addition  in august  the owners drew million under an outstanding letter of credit for liquidated damages they have claimed due 
as of august   the owners have indicated that they may claim as much as million in liquidated damages 
the ultimate assessment could be higher as the owners are claiming that they can assess daily liquidated damages until facility completion is accepted  per day at covert and  per day at harquahala up to a maximum of approximately million for both projects 
on march   we filed liens against both projects and have initiated binding arbitration regarding our claims 
arbitration with the owners is not expected to occur until the summer of calendar year at the earliest 
on february   we were notified by the lenders of the harquahala project of their intention to draw million under the existing million letter of credit for assessed liquidated damages 
we sought an injunction in the supreme court of the state of new york to preclude the lenders from drawing under the letter of credit until arbitration with the owners on the underlying claims is resolved 
a temporary restraining order was granted prohibiting the lenders from drawing under the million letter of credit but was lifted in august at which time the lenders drew million under the outstanding letter of credit 
as of august   a million letter of credit remains outstanding for these projects 
based on our evaluation and advice of legal counsel  we believe we have defenses to the owners claims of liquidated damages 
we intend to vigorously contest the assessment 
additionally  we believe a substantial portion of the delays were caused by our vendors  subcontractors and equipment manufacturers from whom we may collect delay and related damages  and we are pursuing these actions 
for these reasons  our revenue and cost estimates reflect our expectation that we will not incur liquidated damages in excess of amounts we believe would be recoverable from others 
however  there can be no absolute assurance that delay damages will not have to be paid 
if we are required to pay the owners delay damages that we cannot recover from subcontractors  vendors  or equipment manufacturers  that amount will be recorded as a loss 
unrelated to the claims for delay damages discussed above  we have recorded approximately million in claims receivable from the owners  vendors  subcontractors  equipment manufacturers  and insurance 
based on our evaluation of the contractual terms  our claims documentation  and the advice of legal counsel  we believe we have a strong basis for these claims including claims against vendors based on their delivery of incomplete and or defective equipment and claims against various subcontractors for their delays in providing services in excess of the recorded amounts  but we have only recorded a claim receivable for the portion that we estimate will ultimately be collected 
recovery of the claims is dependent upon our negotiations  arbitration and litigation with the owners and their lenders  several subcontractors  vendors and equipment manufacturers 
due to the uncertainties surrounding litigation or arbitration of this nature  we cannot provide absolute assurance to you as to the outcome of these claims or their collectibility 
if we collect amounts different than the amounts that we have recorded as claims receivable of million  that difference will be recognized as income or loss 
timing of collection is uncertain at this time  but is not expected in the next twelve months unless a settlement occurs or the disputes are resolved through the dispute resolution process pursuant to the contract 
the following table summarizes contract amounts due from the owners and claims recorded on these projects  excluding claims related to liquidated damages as of august  in millions

the above amounts are recorded in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts including claims on the consolidated balance sheet at august  in march  we drew the entire amount available under a letter of credit posted by the turbine manufacturer on the covert project for million 
the turbine manufacturer disputes the draw under the letter of credit and arbitration is currently scheduled for march we believe we will prevail in this matter and believe the draw under the letter of credit is in accordance with the terms of the letter of credit 
the turbine manufacturer has also filed a demand for arbitration against us for approximately million in alleged unpaid technical assistance services which has been considered in our overall claims position with the turbine manufacturer 
although neg  the parent of the project entities  filed for chapter bankruptcy in july  the project entities that own these two projects are not included in the bankruptcy proceedings  and we do not believe neg s current financial position will negatively impact future payments to us related to these projects 
based on our evaluation and the advice of legal counsel  we believe it is probable we will recover at least the recorded amount of claims in the arbitration process 
we believe we have a strong basis for claims and backcharges in excess of the recorded amounts  however  recovery of the claims and other amounts is dependent upon negotiations with the applicable parties  which are ongoing  and the results of arbitration 
we cannot provide absolute assurance to you as to the timing or outcome of these negotiations or results of arbitration 
in addition  we hold liens against the projects in connection with our claims under the contract 
we cannot provide assurances to you of the value of such liens or our ability to execute on such liens in a timely manner 
aes wolf hollow project on march   aes frontier  lp and aes wolf hollow  lp collectively aes entered into a series of contracts collectively the epc contract with us to complete the engineering  design  procurement  and construction of a gas fired  combined cycle power plant in texas for an aggregate contract amount of million 
aes represented and warranted at the time of contracting with us that the project was complete and that engineering was complete  and we relied upon this stage of completion in contracting with aes 
at the time we entered into the epc contract  the project s provisional acceptance was scheduled for october   however  acceptance of this project was delayed 
we believe the delay from october  was primarily due to i the significant overstatement of the percentage completion by aes and parsons the engineers on the project at the time we entered into the contract  ii a fire that occurred in june of at the project site  and iii failure of a turbine during start up testing in may we believe the project reached provisional acceptance on july   although aes did not agree to provisional acceptance until august  the contract terms include liquidated damages in the event of late completion of  per day from october  through june 
table of contents  and  per day thereafter until provisional acceptance occurs  for which aes has billed us million in aggregate 
we were unable to resolve our claims with aes through the dispute resolution process called for in the contract with respect to a force majeure claim we made resulting from the fire and other change orders 
on november   we filed suit against aes in the district court of hood county  texas for breach of contract 
on may   we added parsons as a defendant and expanded the complaint to include claims related to misrepresentation 
in june  the aes corporation was also added as a defendant 
in addition  we initiated an arbitration action in september against the heavy equipment supplier to recover million in costs and liquidated damages incurred as a result of defects in their equipment 
discovery is underway in that proceeding  and a hearing is set to begin on january  discovery is currently underway in the aes litigation  and the case is scheduled for a jury trial in march unless we reach a settlement prior to the trial date  we would not expect recovery of disputed amounts due from aes before as of august   there have been no significant changes with regard to this project and related disputes when compared to august  during fiscal  we have continued to incur additional project costs related to punch list and warranty items which have been considered in our total estimate of claims against the owners  subcontractors and vendors due 
in excess of the original million contract price  we have recorded claims receivable from aes of million for additional costs incurred due to the fire  misrepresentation of the percentage of completion  disputed change orders and other claims 
in addition  we have claims of approximately million that we expect to recover from insurance proceeds related to the fire and backcharges from subcontractors and vendors 
of the million  we have collected million through a draw on a letter of credit posted by parsons 
parsons disputes our claims and has filed a counterclaim alleging payments due of million and the return of the million letter of credit draw 
of the original million contract price  aes has not paid million of billed milestones and million of retention 
in addition  million of milestones remain unbilled related to final completion and acceptance  which we expect to occur in early fiscal under the terms of the epc contract  aes  at its option  may pay up to million of the contract price in subordinated notes or cash 
the subordinated notes  million of which we consider issued as of august  for payment of billed milestones  bear interest at prime plus and mature in october if any amounts under the notes are unpaid eight months following final acceptance of the project  the unpaid notes  plus a cash payment of the amounts  if any  paid on the notes through the conversion date  is convertible  at our option  into a equity interest in the project 
further  at the initiation of the project  we secured our obligations under the contract by providing letters of credit totaling million 
in august and september  aes drew the full amount of the letters of credit in two draws of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded an additional receivable of million from aes for reimbursement of these draws which remained outstanding as of august  we recorded revenue of million and a loss of million from this contract for the year ended august  for the year ended august   no gross margin has been recorded on this contract 
the following table summarizes contract amounts due from aes and claims recorded on the project in millions 
table of contents amounts due from aes amounts remaining to be paid under the original contract terms billed milestones receivable subordinated notes receivable from aes retention receivable milestones unbilled at august  to be billed upon completion of final testing and final acceptance total contractual amounts due from aes reimbursement of letter of credit draws claims for additional costs incurred less amount of liquidated damages that have been included in costs total receivables from aes recorded as of august  claims receivable from subcontractors and others less amount collected by drawing letter of credit posted by parsons less amounts collected by drawing letters of credit posted by the turbine manufacturer total receivables recorded as of august  of the total milestones unbilled at august   million could be paid by aes in subordinated notes 
amounts collected under this letter of credit draw are for both liquidated damages and for other claims against the turbine manufacturer 
the above amounts are recorded in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts including claims on the consolidated balance sheet at august  if we collect amounts different than the amounts that we have recorded as receivables from aes of million or if we collect amounts different than the amounts receivable from subcontractors and others of million  the difference would be recognized as income or loss 
aes has assessed and billed us approximately million in liquidated damages due to the late completion of the project 
while we dispute or expect to recover the liquidated damages because late delivery was primarily due to the fire  misrepresentation of the percentage of completion and other delays caused by aes  subcontractors and vendors  we recognized a reduction of revenue of approximately million of liquidated damages 
of the remaining million of liquidated damages  we have excluded million from our cost estimates and we have recorded recoveries of approximately million from subcontractors and vendors  including the turbine manufacturer 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we drew down million from a letter of credit posted by the turbine manufacturer 
the turbine manufacturer disputes the letter of credit draw and has initiated arbitration through a counterclaim for the return of the million letter of credit draw and has asserted additional claims of million for equipment  parts and services allegedly provided 
the following table summarizes how we have accounted for the liquidated damages that aes has assessed on the project in millions amount of liquidated damages that have been included in costs amounts related to liquidated damages that have been excluded from our recorded costs liquidated damages relief from aes liquidated damages to be reimbursed by subcontractors and vendors total liquidated damages assessed by aes 
table of contents if we are required to pay liquidated damages to aes of more than the million and are unable to recover that excess amount from our subcontractors or vendors  then that difference would be recognized as a loss 
based on our evaluation and the advice of legal counsel  we believe it is probable we will recover at least the recorded amount of claims and that we will not pay aes any liquidated damages in excess of the amounts recorded 
we believe we have a strong basis for claims and backcharges in excess of the recorded amounts 
however  recovery of the claims and other amounts is dependent upon negotiations with the applicable parties  which are ongoing  and the results of litigation 
we cannot provide absolute assurance to you as to the timing or outcome of these negotiations or results of litigation 
we hold a mortgage on the project assets  second to the lenders  to secure aes obligations under the subordinated notes 
we also filed a lien against the project in connection with our claims under the contract 
we cannot provide absolute assurance to you of the value of such mortgage or lien or our ability to execute on either in a timely manner 
fple marcus hook our epc project with fpl energy fple for a combined cycle cogeneration plant and auxiliary boiler facility in marcus hook  pennsylvania  has been delayed for various reasons 
each party commenced legal proceedings against the other for various claims 
shortly thereafter  the parties withdrew their lawsuits 
the parties are continuing attempts to resolve these issues 
additionally  two of our subcontractors on the project have filed claims against us alleging total damages of approximately million related to claims for extra costs incurred 
we have asserted a counterclaim of approximately million for costs associated with us obtaining another subcontractor to perform the work after one initial subcontractor failed to complete the project 
mediation with these subcontractors has not been successful to date 
we believe any amounts that we incur related to this project  including legal costs to pursue these issues with subcontractors  are recoverable from fple under the terms of the epc contract 
however  fple has disputed whether these costs are fully reimbursable 
we cannot provide absolute assurance as to the timing or outcome of the mediation or results of the litigation  or disputes with fple  or with the subcontractors 
sec inquiry on june   we were notified by the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec that the staff is conducting an informal inquiry relating to us 
the sec has not advised us as to either the reason for the inquiry or its scope 
the staff s notice states that it should not be construed as an indication of any improper or unlawful conduct by us 
we are cooperating fully with the staff s informal inquiry  however  if the inquiry elevates to a formal investigation  the resolution could have a material adverse effect on us 
securities litigation we and certain of our current officers have been named as defendants in purported shareholder class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws 
these types of class action lawsuits are not uncommon when there has been a notification of even an informal inquiry by the sec 
the first filed lawsuit is styled earl thompson v 
the shaw group inc et al and was filed on june  in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana  case no 
the complaint filed in the thompson action alleges claims under sections b and rule b promulgated thereunder and a of the securities exchange act of on behalf of a class of purchasers of our common stock during the period from october  to june  the complaint alleges  among other things  that i certain of our press releases and sec filings contained material misstatements and omissions  ii that the manner in which we accounted for certain acquisitions was improper and iii that we improperly recorded revenue on certain projects  and as a result  our financial statements were materially misstated at all relevant times 
the complaint does not specify the amount of damages sought 
since the filing of the thompson lawsuit  ten additional purported shareholder class action lawsuits have been filed and other actions may also be commenced 
each of the additional lawsuits includes the same defendants  and essentially alleges the same statutory violations based on the same or similar alleged misstatements and omissions 
ten of these actions have been consolidated under the thompson caption in the eastern district of louisiana 
in addition  two shareholder derivative actions  styled as jonathan nelson v 
jm bernhard  jr  et al 
and larry f 
reusche v 
tim barfield  jr  et al  have been filed based on essentially the same allegations as the purported class actions 
the derivative actions  which the plaintiffs purport to be bringing on behalf of the company  name certain of our directors and current and former officers as defendants  and name the company as a nominal defendant 
the derivative suits collectively make claims of breach of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  gross mismanagement  waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment based on allegations that the named defendants committed  condoned or failed to identify and disclose the alleged misconduct alleged in the purported class actions  and that certain defendants sold company stock while in possession of knowledge of the alleged misconduct 
the complaints do not specify the amount of damages sought 
both the purported shareholder class action lawsuits and the derivative lawsuits are in the early stages of litigation 
we believe our financial statements were prepared in accordance with gaap and that none of our press releases or public filings contained misrepresentations or omissions 
accordingly  we intend to defend the company and our directors and officers vigorously against each of these actions 
although it is not possible at this early stage to predict the likely outcome of these actions  an adverse result in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents other we have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects and other matters 
these are typically actions that arise in the normal course of business  including employment related claims  contractual disputes and claims for personal injury or property damage that occur in connection with our business 
such contractual disputes normally involve claims against us relating to the performance of equipment  design or other engineering services and project construction services 
although the outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted and no assurances can be provided  we believe that  based upon information currently available  the likelihood of an adverse determination in the now pending legal proceedings is remote  and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations either individually or in the aggregate 
however  we cannot guarantee such a result

the following analysis contains forward looking statements about our future revenues  operating results and expectations 
see forward looking statements and associated risks for a discussion of the risks  assumptions and uncertainties affecting these statements as well as risk factors 
critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments and estimates  or involve uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
engineering  procurement and construction contract and environmental and infrastructure revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates including claims a substantial portion of our revenue from both the ecm and e i segments is derived from engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
the contracts may be performed as stand alone engineering  procurement or construction contracts or as combined contracts ie one contract that covers engineering  procurement and construction or a combination thereof 
we use accounting principles set forth in american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and other applicable accounting standards to account for our contracts 
we recognize revenue for these contracts on the percentage of completion method  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
revenues from reimbursable or cost reimbursable contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned 
performance incentives are included in our estimates of revenues using the percentage of completion method when their realization is reasonably assured 
cancellation fees are recognized when received 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which the losses are identified 
the cumulative effect of changes to estimated contract profit and loss  including those arising from contract penalty provisions such as liquidated damages  final contract settlements  warranty claims and reviews of our costs performed by customers  are recognized in the period in which the revisions are identified 
to the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits  we would report such a change by recognizing a charge against current earnings  which might be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
the costs attributable to change orders and claims being negotiated or disputed with customers  vendors or subcontractors or subject to litigation are included in our estimates of revenue when it is probable they will result in additional contract revenue and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
profit from such change orders and claims is recorded in the period such amounts are settled or approved 
it is possible there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and gross margins for contracts currently in process  particularly in the later stages of the contracts 
these adjustments are common in the construction industry and inherent in the nature of our contracts 
these adjustments could  depending on the magnitude of the adjustments and or the number of contracts being completed  materially  positively or negatively  affect our operating results in an annual or quarterly reporting period 
these adjustments are  in our opinion  most likely to occur as a result of  or be affected by  the following factors in the application of the percentage of completion accounting method discussed above for our contracts 
a 
revenues and gross margins from cost reimbursable  long term contracts can be significantly affected by contract incentives penalties that may not be known or finalized until the later stages of the contracts 
substantially all of our revenues from cost reimbursable contracts are based on costs incurred plus the fee earned 
applying our revenue recognition practices to these types of contracts usually results in revenues being recognized as work is performed and costs are incurred and generally results in a reasonably consistent gross margin during most of the contract term 

table of contents our cost reimbursable contracts are sometimes structured as target price contracts 
target price contracts contain an incentive penalty arrangement which results in our fee being adjusted  within certain limits  for cost underruns overruns to an established target price  representing our estimated cost and fee for the project 
in addition  certain target price contracts require that we share in cost overruns in excess of our fee which would result in a loss on the contract should such a level of cost overruns occur 
cost reimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of all of our costs  but generally limit our fee to a fixed percentage of costs or to a certain specified amount and often specify costs that are not reimbursable 
usually  target price contracts are priced with higher fees than cost reimbursable contracts because of the uncertainties relating to an adjustable fee arrangement or for the sharing of potential cost overruns in excess of the fee 
additionally  both the target cost and cost reimbursable contracts frequently have other incentive and penalty provisions for such matters as schedule  testing and performance results 
generally  the penalty provisions for our cost reimbursable contracts are capped to limit our monetary exposure to a portion of the contract gross margin 
although we believe it is unlikely that we could incur losses or lose all of our gross margin on our cost reimbursable contracts  it is possible for penalties to reduce or eliminate previously recorded profits 
the incentive penalty provisions are usually finalized as contract change orders either subsequent to negotiation with  or verification by  our customers 
therefore  while cost reimbursable  target price and other cost reimbursable contracts generally limit our risks on the related projects  we can and do incur losses on these contracts 
in most situations  the amount and impact of incentives penalties are not  or cannot be  finalized until the completion stages of the contract  at which time we will record the adjustment amounts on a cumulative  catch up basis 
b 
the accuracy of gross margins from fixed price contracts is dependent on the accuracy of cost estimates and other factors 
we have a number of fixed price contracts  most of which were entered into on a negotiated basis 
we also have fixed price contracts awarded based on competitive bids 
the accuracy of the gross margins we report for fixed price contracts is dependent upon the judgments we make with respect to our contract performance  our cost estimates  and our ability to recover additional contract costs through change orders  claims or backcharges to the customer  subcontractors and vendors 
many of these contracts also have incentive penalty provisions 
increases in cost estimates  unless recoverable from claims  will result in a reduction in margin equivalent to the cost increase 
c 
revenues and gross margin on contracts can be significantly affected by change orders and claims that may not be ultimately negotiated until the later stages of a contract or subsequent to the date a contract is completed 
during the course of our work on a contract  disputes with other parties involved in the contract can and often do occur 
these disputes are generally the result of one party incurring costs or damages caused by another party during execution of the project 
we may incur additional costs or be damaged and we may cause additional costs or damage other parties 
the other parties include our customer on the contract  subcontractors and vendors we have contracted with to execute portions of the project and others 
we may claim damages against others and others may claim damages against us 
collectively  we refer to disputes related to collection of these damages as claims 
claims include amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from our customers for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price  or other causes of unanticipated additional costs 
these claims against customers are included in our revenue estimates as additional contract revenue to the extent that contract costs have been incurred when the recovery of such amounts is probable 
backcharges and claims against and from our customers  vendors  subcontractors and others are included in our cost estimates as a reduction or increase in total estimated costs when recovery or payment of the amounts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
when estimating the amount of total gross margin or loss on a contract  we include claims related to our customers as adjustments to revenue and claims related to vendors  subcontractors and others as adjustments to cost of revenues when the collection is deemed probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
including claims in this calculation increases the gross margin or reduces the loss that would otherwise be recorded 
table of contents without consideration of the claims 
our claims against others are recorded to the extent of costs incurred and include no profit 
in most cases  the claims included in determining contract gross margin are less than the actual claim that will be or has been presented 
claims are included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on the balance sheet 
claims at august  and relate primarily to three major contracts  all of which are complete or substantially complete 
we are actively engaged in claims negotiation with the other parties or have commenced legal proceedings 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our significant claims 
other revenue recognition and profit and loss estimates the revenue recognition policies related to our fabrication contracts  consulting services  and manufacturing operations are described in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements 
because of the nature of the contracts and related work  estimates and judgments are usually not as significant in the determination of revenue and profit and loss for these services as they are for the engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses that could result from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments 
we record to expense additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s assessment of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  and the balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts for the specific customer reduces the recognized receivable to the net amount we believe will be ultimately collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  further additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts  which would reduce our earnings  may be required 
these increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts could be significant  depending upon i the size of certain of our epc contracts and ii the potential for us to perform a substantial amount of unreimbursed work on significant projects prior to customers notifying us of their intent not to pay the amounts due see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets liabilities are established for the difference between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we also consider the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment of such realization 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
as of august   we had gross deferred tax assets of million including million related to net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
as of august   we had a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
acquisitions fair value accounting and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of their identifiable net assets 
our goodwill balance as of august  was approximately million  most of which related to the stone webster acquisition in fiscal and the it group acquisition in fiscal see notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we completed our annual impairment test during the third quarter of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
we test goodwill for 
table of contents impairment at our operating segment level 
in evaluating whether an impairment of goodwill exists  we calculate the estimated fair value of each of our three segments based on projected discounted cash flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests 
we then compare the resulting fair values by segment to the respective net book values  including goodwill 
if the net book value of a segment exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value which is a reasonable estimate of the value of goodwill for the purpose of measuring an impairment loss of the segment s goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of a segment s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss at that time 
in evaluating whether there was an impairment of goodwill  we also take into consideration changes in our business mix and changes in our projected discounted cash flows  in addition to our stock price and market value of interest bearing obligations 
we do not believe any events have occurred since our annual impairment test that would cause an impairment of goodwill 
however  our businesses are cyclical and subject to competitive pressures 
therefore  it is possible that the goodwill values of our businesses could be adversely impacted in the future by these or other factors and that a significant impairment adjustment  which would reduce earnings and affect various debt covenants  could be required in such circumstances 
our next required annual impairment test will be conducted in the third quarter of fiscal unless indicators of impairment occur prior to that time 
our estimates of the fair values of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities we acquire in acquisitions are determined by reference to various internal and external data and judgments  including the use of third party experts 
these estimates can and do differ from the basis or value generally representing the acquired entity s actual or amortized cost previously recorded by the acquired entity for its assets and liabilities 
accordingly  our post acquisition financial statements are materially impacted by and dependent on the accuracy of management s fair value estimates and adjustments 
our experience has been that the most significant of these estimates are the values assigned to construction contracts  production backlog  customer relationships  licenses and technology 
these estimates can also have a positive or negative material effect on future reported operating results 
further  our future operating results may also be positively or negatively materially impacted if the final values for the assets acquired or liabilities assumed in our acquisitions are materially different from the fair value estimates which we recorded for the acquisition 
long lived assets we periodically assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets  including licenses  patents  technology and related processes  based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations 
should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the other intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss 
litigation  commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims  lawsuits  environmental matters and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based on professional knowledge and experience of our management and legal counsel 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  amounts are recorded as charges to earnings when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension plans are regularly evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries who are relied upon as experts 
in the event that we determine that changes are warranted in the assumptions used  such as the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on investments  or future salary costs  our future pension benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
as of august   we had a minimum pension liability recorded of million 
this liability will likely require us to increase our future cash contributions to the plans 
general we segregate our business activities into three operating segments environmental and infrastructure e i 
table of contents segment  engineering  construction maintenance ecm segment  and fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment 
environmental infrastructure the e i segment provides services which include the identification of contaminants in soil  air and water and the subsequent design and execution of remedial solutions 
this segment also provides project and facilities management and other related services to non environmental construction  watershed restoration and outsourcing privatization markets 
engineering  construction maintenance the ecm segment provides a range of project related services  including design  engineering  construction  procurement  maintenance  technology and consulting services  primarily to the power generation and process industries 
fabrication  manufacturing and distribution the fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment provides integrated piping systems and services for new construction  site expansion and retrofit projects for industrial plants 
on august   we sold our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses for approximately million 
these businesses designed  engineered and fabricated pipe hangers  mechanical scrubbers  and specialty stainless  alloy and carbon steel pipe fittings 
the results of operations for the hanger engineering and pipe support businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the statements of operations for the years ended august   and comments regarding future operations historically  we have used acquisitions to pursue market opportunities and to augment or increase existing capabilities and plan to continue to do so 
however  all comments concerning our expectations for future revenue and operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions 
results of operations a substantial portion of our revenue and profit  particularly for our ecm and e i segments  is derived from epc projects 
some of these projects may span several years from start to finish 
we recognize revenue and margin for these contracts on the percentage of completion method which requires estimates of the total revenue and total costs at completion  as well as the progress towards completion 
these estimates are dependent upon judgments including material costs and quantities  labor productivity  subcontractor performance and other factors 
in addition  disputes on our projects can and sometimes do occur with our customers  subcontractors and equipment vendors that require significant judgment as to the ultimate resolution and may take an extended period of time to resolve 
the percentage of completion method requires that adjustments to estimated revenues and costs  including estimated claim recoveries  be recognized on a cumulative basis  when the adjustments are identified 
when adjustments are identified  the impact of the change in estimate would be recognized as a change in the margin on the contract in that period 
this can result in a material impact on our results for a single reporting period 
therefore  our discussion of results includes descriptions of significant changes in major projects and their impact on our results 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  summary revenues  gross profit and gross profit percentages in millions  except for percentages 
table of contents year ended august  revenues e i ecm fabrication  manufacturing and distribution total revenue gross profit e i ecm fabrication  manufacturing and distribution total gross profit gross profit percentage e i ecm fabrication  manufacturing and distribution total gross profit percentage our revenues by industry sector were as follows in millions  except for percentages year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions in millions environmental and infrastructure power generation process industries other industries the following tables present our revenues by geographic region in millions  except for percentages year ended august  geographic region in millions in millions in millions united states asia pacific rim middle east europe canada south america and mexico other backlog by segment is as follows in millions  except for percentages year ended august  in millions in millions in millions e i ecm fabrication  manufacturing and distribution backlog by industry sector is as follows in millions  except for percentages 
table of contents year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions in millions environmental and infrastructure power generation process industries other industries executive summary during fiscal  we experienced increasing activity in our ecm and e i segments as reflected in our backlog  with new power generation projects in new york and utah  increasing activity in the process maintenance and process technology sectors  and new awards in the middle east 
however  fiscal revenue was negatively impacted by a reduction in the number of domestic new construction power projects offset by higher revenue from the transmission and distribution sector through our eds acquisition in december  and e i service contracts supporting us government projects in iraq 
the major factors contributing to the decrease in our ecm segment gross profit percentages for fiscal as compared to fiscal were charges related to the covert and harquahala projects  and decrease in overall activity of domestic new construction power plants 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses which are included in our fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment should no longer be part of our core business plan  and therefore began actively marketing these businesses 
placing these businesses as available for sale resulted in an impairment charge and restatement to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations 
the primary assets of these operations were sold on august  our backlog increased significantly in fiscal with new project awards including two epc contracts in new york and utah  desulphurization contracts for two customers  new contracts related to clean fuels emissions projects as well as increased awards on us government contracts in the middle east 
backlog is largely a reflection of the broader positive economic trends being experienced by our customers and is important in anticipating operational needs 
backlog is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles  and our methodology in determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog 
we cannot provide any assurance that revenues projected in our backlog will be realized  or if realized  will result in profits 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog for further discussion of our methodology in determining backlog 
we have continued to use cash in support of our operations  capital expenditures and acquisitions  specifically  our acquisition of energy delivery services  inc in december and capital contributions to our military housing privatization joint venture entities 
our financing activities have been a source of cash for us with two equity issuances in october and may which allowed us to pay down our lyons debt 
the following presents a comparison of our operating results and certain other information for fiscal as compared with fiscal for our three business segments 
fiscal compared to fiscal e i segment 
table of contents revenues e i segment the increase in revenues of million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to project services supporting the us government customers in iraq of million  public works and logistic support services for the us army of million  and offset by a decrease in domestic federal remediation work of approximately million 
during fiscal  we have incurred bid and proposal  business development  start up expenses  and other contract support costs of million associated with pursuing new opportunities for international projects in the middle east for our federal customers and others 
to date  we have won federal contract awards for unfunded projects in iraq of approximately billion 
as of august   we have approximately million in unfunded backlog based on task orders received and our estimate of backlog utilization based on the current political and infrastructure developments in iraq 
gross profit and gross profit percentage e i segment the increase in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to a reduction in the estimated cost to complete a major fixed price contract impacting gross profit by million in  a favorable contract settlement on a completed project of million in  favorable completion activities on a major time and materials project and revisions to cost estimates based on revised scope activities yielded an additional million gross profit in  a reduction in a warranty liability of approximately million in  and an increase of million for a one time reduction in an employee benefits accrual relating to a change in an employee benefits policy in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal and fiscal reflect an increase decrease in cost of revenues of million and million  respectively  for amortization of contract asset liability adjustments related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition  and million and million for fiscal and  respectively  for the recognition of accrued loss reserves related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition 
backlog e i segment backlog for the e i segment was billion as of august  compared to billion as of august  the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to increased awards for services to us government customers in iraq of approximately million  the award of a world wide contract with backlog of approximately million along with steady backlog derived from our commercial customers domestically 
these increases were offset by scheduled work and completed projects during fiscal we believe e i segment revenues will remain consistent in fiscal  but increase over the next several years as a result of a combination of factors  including market opportunities in various environmental clean up  homeland security and both domestic and international infrastructure markets  including the middle east 

table of contents we anticipate fiscal revenues to be generally consistent with fiscal  however  we expect our gross profit to decrease in fiscal due to a change in the mix of work  with the completion of some of our large projects in fiscal with the expectation of new work based on a more competitive environment in this industry sector 
ecm segment the following table presents ecm revenues from customers in the following industry sectors year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions power generation process industries other industries revenues ecm segment the decrease of million or in segment revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal is due to several contributing factors including the completion and winding down of several domestic new construction power plants that commenced prior to fiscal  specifically the completion of gas fired power generation projects and related power engineering and construction activity in fiscal  with minimal activity for new construction gas fired power generation projects during fiscal and early fiscal due to a weakened power market  the decrease was offset by an increase in revenues from engineering and procurement activities on the combined cycle power plants in queens  new york and mona  utah and services to other customers related to the process industries  nuclear restart project and engineering services related to our proprietary technologies  an increase from maintenance services related to multi location service contracts signed with several customers during fiscal  and an increase in revenues of million for fiscal generated by our eds operations acquired in the second quarter of fiscal gross profit and gross profit percentages ecm segment the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to a million charge related to the covert and harquahala projects the neg projects in fiscal and a reduction in our estimated claims recovery and an increase in estimated cost at completion related to the harquahala project for costs related primarily to the duration of our involvement in start up and on warranty related activities compared to a million charge related to the neg projects in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the neg projects  a negative impact of million related to a reduction of our incentive fee on a target price contract to build a combined cycle cogeneration facility near philadelphia  pennsylvania  a reduction in our estimated claims recovery in the fourth quarter of fiscal of approximately million on a uk construction project that was substantially complete in  pass through equipment and other costs primarily on the power plant project in queens  new york  and a decrease in activity in our uk construction operations 

table of contents our margins for fiscal were positively impacted by approximately million in gross profit recognition on certain projects that were substantially complete prior to fiscal due to favorable resolution of remaining estimated costs and exposures on such projects 
the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal as compared to fiscal was partially offset by an increase in gross profit due to the increase in activity as we ramp up progress on two combined cycle power plants in queens  new york and mona  utah  an increase in margin related to sales of our proprietary technology from our badger joint venture which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal  an increase in activity on the tva nuclear restart project beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  and the positive impact on gross profit from the acquisition of eds which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal and reflect an increase decrease in cost of revenues of million and million for amortization of contract liability adjustments related to contracts acquired in the fiscal stone webster acquisition 
as major projects are completed and their project costs finalized  the ecm segment s margins have been  and we expect will continue to be  positively or negatively impacted by contract completion negotiations with customers  subcontractors and vendors on such projects as well as the outcome of litigation and settlement discussions 
backlog ecm segment segment backlog at august  was approximately billion  compared with approximately billion at august   and was comprised of the following august  august  industry sector in millions in millions power generation nuclear power fossil fuel epc other total power generation process industries other industries total ecm ecm segment s backlog has increased million or from august  primarily due to growth in our fossil fuel epc backlog 
our fossil fuel epc backlog includes the uncompleted portions of a million fixed priced epc contract and a million target priced epc contract to build gas fired combined cycle power plants 
additionally  backlog has increased due to a new customer contract for cleaner air emissions on four power plants as well as the expansion of epc services to an existing customer related to cleaner air emissions 
backlog has also been increased for the expansion of nuclear and process maintenance services to both new and existing customers 
given recent new project awards in fiscal for domestic gas fired power plants as well as an increase in demand for services in the power and process industries  we expect revenues to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal with improved gross profit percentages in fiscal fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment revenues fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment 
table of contents the decrease in revenue of million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to reduced domestic demand  primarily from power generation customers  without material offsetting increases in other industry sectors 
the process industry chemical  petro chemical and refinery comprises the majority of our fiscal revenues 
revenue in fiscal also includes million in revenue from shaw nass middle east  wll and our china joint venture which were consolidated effective may  in accordance with fin r 
the china joint venture was subsequently deconsolidated effective august  gross profit and gross profit percentage fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment the reduced demand for the segment s products and the increase in overall market competitiveness has had a negative impact on pricing which has impacted gross profit and gross profit percentage for fiscal  however  we continue to experience an increase in activity into early fiscal this lower gross profit and gross profit percentage in fiscal was slightly offset by ceasing production at certain smaller facilities  consolidating operations  and implementing other cost savings programs for this segment 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we began marketing for sale our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses 
in connection with this asset disposal plan  we recognized a million net of tax of million impairment charge for fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of fabrication  manufacturing and distribution have been restated to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations 
on august   we sold these businesses for million in cash 
backlog fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment backlog for this segment has increased from million at august  to million at august  the increase in backlog reflects new contracts to process industry customers and the addition of million in backlog from shaw nass middle east  wll  a non wholly owned entity that was consolidated effective may  in accordance with fin r 
the increase in backlog was partially offset by work performed under existing contracts during fiscal based on our market outlook  we expect revenues and gross profit levels to slightly increase for the first two quarters of fiscal with further improvement in revenues and gross profit for the remainder of fiscal given the recent increased demand 
unconsolidated entities during fiscal  we recognized earnings of million net of tax of million as compared to a loss of million net of a tax benefit of million for fiscal from operations of unconsolidated entities  including joint ventures  which are accounted for using the equity method 
included in the earnings of fiscal is million related to the operations of space gateway  llc  an unconsolidated joint venture acquired in the it group acquisition 
in august  we sold our interest for cash proceeds of million and realized a gain on the sale of million 
the loss in fiscal includes a loss related to the winding down of operations for entergyshaw see note to our consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income  other income expense  income taxes  and other comprehensive income general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal compared with approximately million in fiscal our general and administrative expenses for fiscal included amortization expense of million related to the acceleration of amortization of certain software assets in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of a successful implementation of software systems see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the million of accelerated depreciation includes million of amortization that would have been recorded on these assets in fiscal had we not accelerated the amortization resulting in a net increase of general and administrative expenses of million for fiscal over fiscal the remaining increase is due primarily to the inclusion of the results of badger technologies  which we acquired in april  for a full year in  the inclusion of the operating results of shaw eds which we acquired in 
table of contents december and the impact of the consolidation of several variable interest entities as required by fin r which were previously reported on an unconsolidated basis 
for fiscal  general and administrative expenses were of revenues as compared to for fiscal without the additional amortization of million  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were relatively consistent with fiscal interest expense was approximately million for fiscal  compared to approximately million for fiscal the increase over prior year is primarily due to the issuance on march  of approximately million  senior notes  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to lyons repurchases with a total amortized value of approximately million in late fiscal and throughout fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our interest costs also include the amortization of loan fees associated with the senior notes  the lyons and the credit facility  as well as unused line of credit and letter of credit fees  and therefore  our interest expense is higher than would be expected based on our borrowing levels and the stated interest rates 
interest income for fiscal decreased to approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  as a result of lower levels of invested funds due to use of working capital  acquisitions and cash paid for the repurchase of a portion of the lyons 
the lyons repurchases in fiscal resulted in a loss of approximately million which included expenses and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognized a gain of million on lyon repurchases in fiscal we also recorded foreign currency transaction losses of million in fiscal  as compared to a gain of million in fiscal these foreign currency transaction losses are primarily due to us dollar denominated cash accounts held by our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency strengthened compared to the us dollar in fiscal and fiscal although these foreign currency transaction gains losses are reflected in the statements of operations  substantially all of these gains losses did not directly impact our cash position on a consolidated basis 
our effective tax rate was for both fiscal and our tax rate is significantly impacted by the mix of foreign including foreign export revenues versus domestic work 
we did not pay any federal income taxes in fiscal primarily because of a projected taxable loss for fiscal and the availability of operating losses resulting from the it group and stone webster acquisitions 
in fiscal and  we recorded a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  against certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance reflects our judgment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we believe that the remaining deferred tax assets at august  amounting to million  are realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income and the timing of future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
uncertainties that affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets include the risk of not having future taxable income 
these factors have been considered in determining the valuation allowances 
as of august   we have classified million of deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances  related to net operating loss carryforwards  research and development credits and foreign tax credits as non current as we do not anticipate realization of these amounts in the next twelve months 
the long term deferred tax assets have been offset by long term deferred tax liabilities resulting in a million net long term deferred tax asset as of august  the loss from discontinued operations of million net of tax of million  in fiscal includes a million net of a tax benefit of million impairment charge related to an asset disposal plan of our hanger engineering and pipe support businesses within our fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment which are classified as discontinued operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on august   the assets of these discontinued operations were sold for million in net cash proceeds 
fiscal compared to fiscal general 
table of contents our revenues by industry sector were as follows year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions environmental and infrastructure power generation process industries other industries the increase in total revenue from to was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from our e i segment  partially reduced by the extended weakness in the domestic power market  which has had a pervasive negative impact on our ecm and fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment revenues 
revenue from the power generation sector was approximately million less in fiscal than in fiscal  as revenue from several large gas fired power generation projects  which commenced in fiscal and early fiscal  declined upon completion of those projects 
the decrease in power industry revenue was offset by a million increase in environmental and infrastructure revenue from fiscal to fiscal  due primarily to the acquisition of the it group in may see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  and a million increase in process revenue  due primarily to a  tons per year ethylene plant project in china 
the following tables present our revenues by geographic region year ended august  geographic region in millions in millions united states asia pacific rim canada europe south america and mexico middle east other revenues for projects in the united states increased million for the year ended august  due primarily to growth in environmental and infrastructure revenues  partially offset by the previously mentioned decline in power generation revenues 
revenues from international projects increased to million for the year ended august  from million for the year ended august  the revenue increase in the asia pacific rim region was primarily due to the result of the work performed on the ethylene plant in china 
the increase in revenue in canada was due primarily to an environmental consulting unit acquired through the it group acquisition 
backlog by industry sector is as follows at august  industry sector in millions in millions environmental and infrastructure power generation process industries other industries the decrease in backlog of million from august  is attributable to reduction in demand for gas fired power generation services  which resulted in a decrease in new orders for our services 
since august   the decline in power generation awards has been partially offset by increases in awards for environmental and infrastructure services  services to the process industry  and nuclear maintenance services 
approximately of 
table of contents the backlog relates to domestic projects and approximately of the backlog relates to work projected at the time to be completed during the twelve months following august  power generation backlog at august  does not include our million fixed price epc contract signed and announced in september to build a combined cycle power plant in queens  new york 
we included this project in our backlog when financing for the project was completed in backlog is largely a reflection of the broader economic trends being experienced by our customers and is important in anticipating operational needs 
backlog is not a measure defined in generally accepted accounting principles  and our methodology in determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodology used by other companies in determining their backlog 
we cannot provide any assurance that revenues projected in our backlog will be realized  or if realized  will result in profits 
the following presents a comparison of our operating results and certain other information for the year ended august  as compared with the year ended august  for our three business segments 
we have conformed our prior year segment financial information to be consistent with our current year presentation of our reorganized segments 
e i segment the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to our acquisition of the it group assets and operations in may  as twelve months of revenues are included in fiscal as compared to four months in fiscal see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to our acquisition of the it group assets and operations in may gross profit was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the amortization of asset liability adjustments to the fair value of contracts acquired in the it group acquisition 
in addition  gross profit was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the usage of accrued loss reserves related to contracts acquired in the it group acquisition see note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the reduction in the gross profit percentage in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributable to lower margin contracts associated with the businesses acquired in the it group acquisition 
the difference in the gross profit percentages between our pre it group environmental and infrastructure operations primarily infrastructure and hazardous material clean up and disposal and those acquired in the it group acquisition environmental clean up  landfills and facilities management is primarily attributable to differences in customers  competition and mix of services 
backlog for the e i segment increased to approximately billion as of august  from approximately billion as of august  
table of contents ecm segment the following tables present ecm revenues from customers in the following industry sectors year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions power generation process industries other industries the decrease in total segment revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to the downturn in the domestic power market  specifically the decline in gas fired power generation projects and power engineering and consulting activity which reduced new orders for our ecm services  partially offset by an increase in revenue from process projects and nuclear maintenance and restart projects 
process industry revenues increased primarily due to work on the ethylene plant project in china that is scheduled to continue into fiscal gross profit for the ecm segment for fiscal decreased from fiscal  due primarily to the reduction of estimated margins on certain contracts for the construction of new gas fired power plants  offset by increases in margin on nuclear maintenance and restart projects and the ethylene plant project in china 
the ethylene plant in china contributed significantly more to gross margin in the fourth quarter of than in each of the first three quarters due to a reduction in the estimated cost at completion 
the impact of the reduction in the estimated cost positively impacted gross profit in the fourth quarter of by million 
gross margin for the third and fourth quarters of also was positively impacted by increasing activity on the tva nuclear restart project and recognition of components of project incentives earned based on our performance to date on this project 
further  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million in revenue that we earned as a fee for providing a letter of credit to an independent power producer ipp to secure the ipp s power purchase agreement 
as epc projects that began in fiscal and early fiscal are completed and their project costs finalized  the ecm segment s margins have been  and we expect will continue to be  positively or negatively impacted by contract completion negotiations with customers and vendors on such projects 
we recognized million in margin in as a result of the favorable resolution of various contingencies  contract claims and backcharges related to projects that were substantially complete at august  during fiscal  we also recognized million in margin as a result of the favorable resolution of estimated project obligations which were recorded when we acquired stone webster in fiscal gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by the covert and harquahala projects the neg projects  on which we recorded revenues of million during and a million charge million of which resulted from reversal of gross profit recorded prior to fiscal related to the neg projects that negatively impacted the ecm segment s gross profit by for fiscal this charge was a result of increased estimated costs to complete these projects combined with an agreement with the owners of these projects and their lenders that increased the contract prices by a total of million and converted the contracts from target price to fixed price see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of claims related to major ecm projects  including additional discussion of the covert and harquahala projects 
of the million loss recorded during on the neg projects  million was recorded in the fourth quarter reflecting a million increase in estimated cost at completion of the projects  offset by an increase in expected recovery of claims from neg and backcharges and liquidated damages expected from vendors and subcontractors totaling million 
gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by the aes wolf hollow project  on which we recorded revenues of million during with a reversal of previously recorded profit of million 
on this project  we recorded claims receivable from our customer  aes  of million and claims  backcharges and other cost recovery receivables from subcontractors  vendors and others of million see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the wolf hollow project in we reversed previously recorded profit of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from the settlement with our customer of disputed change orders and other items on our target price epc contract to build a combined cycle cogeneration facility near philadelphia  pennsylvania 
the settlement agreement eliminates our exposure to 
table of contents schedule risk and related liquidated damages  maintains our guaranteed minimum fee and provides for incentives that allow us to earn profit in excess of the minimum fee 
in october  we entered into a settlement agreement with a customer for which we executed three separate projects prior to fiscal under the settlement agreement  we received million representing the return of amounts our customer had drawn on our letter of credit and payment for costs incurred which were previously in dispute 
we will record no gain or loss on the settlement because the settlement proceeds are equal to the net assets recorded 
gross profit for the year ended august  was increased cost of revenues decreased by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal for the amortization of contract liability adjustments related to contracts acquired in the stone webster acquisition in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended august   less ecm segment revenues were derived from large equipment purchases 
such revenues were approximately million for the year ended august   compared to approximately million for the year ended august  segment backlog at august  was approximately billion  compared with approximately billion at august   and was comprised of the following year ended august  industry sector in millions in millions power generation nuclear power fossil fuel epc other total power generation process industries other industries total ecm the ecm segment s backlog declined from august  because the amount of work performed on power generation contracts was not fully replaced with new orders due to the downturn in demand for power generation services 
our fossil fuel epc backlog does not include our million fixed price epc contract signed and announced in september to build a combined cycle power plant in queens  new york 
fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment the decreases in revenues and gross profit percentages in fiscal versus fiscal were attributable to reduced domestic demand  primarily from power generation customers  without offsetting increases in other industry sectors 
the reduced demand for the segment s products has had a negative impact on pricing and gross profit 
backlog for this segment has decreased from million at august  to million at august  this decrease includes a reduction of backlog from one customer in the power industry 
as a result of the current market situation  we have decided to significantly reduce or cease production at certain smaller facilities  consolidate certain operations  and implement certain other cost savings programs for this segment 
further  we have suspended operations at our facility in venezuela due to the political situation in that 
table of contents country 
unconsolidated subsidiaries during fiscal  we recognized a loss of million net of taxes of million from operations of unconsolidated subsidiaries  including joint ventures  which are accounted for using the equity method 
these losses were primarily attributable to three joint ventures including our entergy shaw  shaw nass and shaw ypc piping nanjing co 
ltd joint venture 
the entergy shaw joint venture has no active projects as of august  as of august   we have a negative investment balance of million  and we expect to continue to fund the joint venture until it is dissolved as all projects were completed as of august  the loss in the shaw nass joint venture was due to weaker sales of fabricated pipe in the middle east in fiscal as compared to while the loss in the china joint venture reflects costs incurred in the early stages of the joint venture until its facility is running at full capacity which is scheduled for early calendar year in fiscal  we realized income of approximately million net of taxes of million from the entergy shaw joint venture and losses of million net of taxes of million from shaw nass net of taxes due to the operations of these unconsolidated subsidiaries and joint ventures 
general and administrative expenses  interest expense and income  other income expense  income taxes  and other comprehensive income general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in fiscal  compared with approximately million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal a substantial portion of the approximate million increase in general and administrative costs are attributable to the operations of the e i segment comprised largely of the it group operations which we acquired during the third quarter of fiscal 
we also incurred increased depreciation and facilities costs in fiscal resulting from capital projects and the move into our new corporate facility in baton rouge  louisiana completed in the latter part of fiscal general and administrative costs for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year were reduced by million resulting from the favorable resolution of estimated obligations recorded in the acquisition of stone webster in fiscal interest expense was approximately million in fiscal  compared to approximately million in fiscal the increase over prior year is primarily due to the issuance on march  of approximately million principal amount of year  senior notes  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense related to the lyons repurchase with an amortized value of approximately million in march see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our interest costs also include the amortization of loan fees associated with the senior notes  the lyons and the credit facility  as well as unused line of credit and letter of credit fees  and therefore  our interest expense is higher than would be expected based on our borrowing levels and the stated interest rates 
a significant portion of our interest expense accretion of zero coupon discount interest and amortization of loan fees represents non cash charges 
interest income in fiscal decreased to approximately million from million in fiscal as a result of lower levels of invested funds due to use of working capital  cash paid for the repurchase of a portion of the lyons  and the purchase of treasury stock 
for fiscal  other income expense included a charge of approximately million for the write off of i investments in securities available for sale of orion of approximately million  ii accounts and claims receivable due from orion of approximately million  and iii other accounts receivable of approximately million 
also included in other income expense for fiscal were gains of approximately million and million  net of expenses and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs  related to the march and august  respectively  repurchases of portions of the lyons see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our tax rate is significantly impacted by the mix of foreign including foreign export revenues versus domestic work 
the decrease in the tax rate in fiscal versus fiscal is due primarily to the decrease in income before taxes  and the related increase in the ratio of favorable permanent differences to income before taxes 
additionally  the increased foreign income in 
table of contents fiscal had a lower overall rate of tax than domestic income 
we did not pay any federal income taxes in fiscal primarily because of a taxable loss for the fiscal year and the utilization of operating losses resulting from the it group and stone webster acquisitions 
in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the venezuelan net operating losses and in fiscal  we established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for the australian net operating losses 
the valuation allowance reflects our judgment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we believe that the remaining deferred tax assets at august   amounting to million  are realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income 
uncertainties that affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets include the risk of not having future taxable income 
this factor has been considered in determining the valuation allowance 
during fiscal  the accumulated benefit obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets for two of our united kingdom uk defined benefit retirement plans and our canadian defined benefit retirement plan  and a liability of million  net of tax was recorded see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the increase in the minimum liability is recorded through a direct charge to stockholders equity and is reflected  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet as of august  this liability will likely require us to increase our future cash contributions to the plan 
liquidity and capital resources credit facilities as of august   we had a million credit facility that provides for both revolving credit loans and letters of credit within the million limit 
we primarily use this credit facility for the issuance of letters of credit which relate to our projects and are issued in the normal course of business 
from time to time  we also use the credit facility for working capital needs and to fund fixed asset purchases and acquisitions 
on august   we did not have outstanding borrowings under the credit facility but had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million 
effective august   we received approval from our bank lenders for a fourth amendment to our credit facility fourth amendment to amend various financial covenants and certain other terms in our credit facility 
in particular  the fourth amendment i maintained the maximum leverage ratio at x  ii expanded the definition of ebitda  as defined by the credit facility  to exclude charges related to certain potential divestiture and restructuring charges in fiscal  iii provided for the ability to offset proceeds from the sale of assets against capital expenditures in calculating the fixed charge coverage ratio and maximum capital expenditure covenant and iv clarified the treatment of restricted cash in calculating the minimum working capital covenant 
the credit facility provides for a first lien on certain property  including equipment and real estate as collateral 
we also have the ability to obtain unsecured performance letters of credit outside of the credit facility of up to million 
the fourth amendment did not otherwise change the interest rates or the total capacity to borrow or obtain letters of credit under the credit facility 
the credit facility  as amended  contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio of x through may  and x thereafter  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x  a minimum net worth as defined by the credit facility  a defined minimum earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
ebitda  as defined in the credit facility  is adjusted for certain non cash items and for the pro forma impact of acquisitions and dispositions of operations adjusted ebitda 
the minimum adjusted ebitda covenant requires a trailing twelve months ebitda of million for the three fiscal quarters ended august  and million thereafter on a rolling twelve month basis  and 
table of contents a minimum working capital ratio requirement  as defined by the credit facility  of to the credit facility also imposes restrictions on annual capital expenditures to of annual ebitda  as defined  among other restrictions 
as of august   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the credit facility as amended 
however  we would not have been in compliance with the maximum capital expenditure covenant without the amendment 
we would not have complied with this capital expenditure covenant due to higher than expected capital expenditures associated with consolidated variable interest entities and a lower than expected trailing twelve months ebitda in fiscal which is used to determine the threshold for allowable capital expenditures 
as of august   we were in compliance with the other credit facility covenants prior to the amendment 
the leverage ratio limits the amount of cash that can be borrowed 
as of august   after applying the terms of the fourth amendment  the maximum amount that could be borrowed under the leverage ratio is approximately million  subject to the overall availability under the credit facility which was million as of august   after consideration for outstanding letters of credit 
we are required  with certain exceptions  to prepay loans outstanding under the credit facility with i the proceeds of new indebtedness  ii net cash proceeds from equity sales to third parties if not used for acquisitions or other general corporate purposes within days after receipt  and iii insurance proceeds or condemnation awards in excess of million that are not used to purchase a similar asset or for a like business purpose within days of the receipt thereof 
as of august   we do not have outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
further  we are required to obtain the consent of the lenders to prepay or amend the terms of the senior notes due as of august  and  our foreign subsidiaries had short term revolving lines of credit permitting borrowings totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
these subsidiaries had outstanding borrowings under these lines of approximately million and million  respectively  at a weighted average interest rate of approximately at august  and august  these subsidiaries also had outstanding letters of credit under these lines of million and million  at august  and  respectively  leaving million of availability under these lines at august  as of august   one of our consolidated joint ventures had a committed short term revolving line of credit of million with borrowings of million at a weighted average interest rate of and we guarantee the debt 
liquidity our liquidity position is improved by cash generated from operations  customer advances on contracts in progress and access to capital financial markets 
as customer advances are reduced through project execution  our cash position will be reduced if not replaced by advances on new projects 
cash is used to fund operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  contributions to joint ventures and debt service 
as of august   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million of availability under our million credit facility and a shelf registration statement with a remaining million available for the issuance of any combination of equity or debt securities 
management believes that cash generated from operations  the sale of certain non core or under performing assets  available borrowings under our credit facility and  if necessary  available sales of equity or debt under our shelf registration will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months 
cash flow for fiscal versus fiscal net cash used in operations was approximately million for fiscal as compared with million for fiscal for fiscal  cash was adjusted for non cash items including i depreciation and amortization of million  ii interest accretion and loan fee amortization of million  iii a loss on the repurchase of the lyons of million  iv losses on foreign currency transactions of million  v loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes of million and vi stock based compensation of million 
these increases in cash 
table of contents were offset by i a net loss of million  ii amortization of purchase accounting contract reserves of million  iii a deferred tax benefit of million and iv minority interest of million 
normally  billings and cash receipts on construction contracts exceed costs incurred early in the lives of the contracts and the contracts require net cash outflow in the later stages of completion 
as we are completing a number of large epc contracts and did not enter into any significant new epc contracts in fiscal  normal contract execution has required a net use of cash 
further  we have been involved in various customer disputes  most significantly nrg  neg and aes projects 
the neg projects resulted in net cash outflow of approximately million for fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the aes dispute involved unpaid billings  claims  letter of credit draws by aes  and other factors  which resulted in a cash outflow of million in fiscal which was offset by a million draw on a letter of credit held by us 
an offset to these uses in cash is the settlement of the nrg dispute related to the pike project in october  in which we received million in cash during the first quarter of fiscal this use of cash was also partially offset in fiscal by the impact of cash advances related to significant epc contracts entered into in fiscal including the astoria project which contributed net positive cash of million 
in fiscal  we expect we will begin new epc projects which will provide cash as down payments on such projects 
however  the timing of these new projects is uncertain and a single or group of large projects could have a significant impact on sources and uses of cash 
we also expect to have a project nearing completion that will generate approximately million in cash outflow  the majority of which will occur in fiscal because of these projects  changes in working capital could be highly variable from one period to the next  although over an extended period of time  significant increases and decreases would tend to offset one another 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for fiscal  as compared with net cash provided by of million for fiscal during fiscal  we used cash for acquisitions of million and purchased million of property and equipment which is comparable to million for acquisitions and million of property and equipment for fiscal we also received cash proceeds of million for the sale of property and equipment  assets held for sale and the sale of an investment in an unconsolidated entity 
in addition  maturities of marketable securities were million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal attributable to less cash on hand to invest since we utilized the cash to support operating activities during fiscal for fiscal  investing activities also included the deposit and withdrawal of million into escrow cash for the repurchase of lyons debt see note to our consolidated financial statements and cash received and deposited in project related restricted and escrowed cash of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million for fiscal  compared to million for the same period in fiscal the net cash used by financing activities for fiscal reflects i approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in october with the majority of the proceeds used to purchase million in outstanding lyons in the first quarter of fiscal at a cost of million  ii approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in april  iii proceeds from issuance of debt of million  iv deferred credit costs of million and v stock option exercises generating million 
the net proceeds of the april equity offering along with the remaining net proceeds from our october equity offering and available cash on hand were used to repurchase approximately million of our outstanding lyons under a tender offer on may  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we provide financial guarantees to certain of our joint ventures which are reported under the equity method and are not consolidated on our balance sheet see note to our consolidated financial statement 
at august   we had committed to guarantee million of bank debt or letters of credit with approximately million outstanding as of august  we also provide performance bonds with respect to our unconsolidated joint ventures 
these performance bonds outstanding totaled million as of august  we would generally be required to perform under these guarantees in the event of default by the joint venture s 
no amounts were recorded related to these guarantees as of august  on a limited basis  performance assurances are extended to customers  primarily in our power and process divisions within our ecm segment  which guarantee certain performance measurements upon completion of a project 
if 
table of contents performance assurances are extended to customers  our maximum potential exposure would be the remaining cost of the work to be performed by or on behalf of third parties under engineering and construction contracts with potential recovery from third party vendors and subcontractors for work performed in the ordinary course of contract execution 
as a result  the total costs of the project could exceed our original cost estimates and we could experience reduced gross profit or a loss for that project 
in some cases  where we fail to meet certain performance standards  we may be subject to contractual liquidated damages and or the actual damages 
in january  our subsidiary  stone webster  inc  was awarded a subcontract to perform engineering services for a company the related company for whom an executive officer and a significant owner is the brother to our chief executive officer for total consideration of approximately million 
in connection with the services agreement  we entered into a guaranty agreement with the related company under which we agreed  under certain circumstances  to guarantee the payment of certain sums which may be owed by the related company to its client under a performance based services and equipment contract 
that guaranty  by its terms  may be assigned by the related company to its client 
we also entered into an indemnification and fee agreement between us and the related company pursuant to which  among other things  the related company must pay us an annual fee in consideration for our entering into the guaranty agreement 
the amount of the annual fee varies  but totals approximately million over the year term 
although we believe the probability we will have to make any payments under the guaranty agreement is remote  we have recorded the guarantee at its fair value which we believe is million at august  we have the right  but not the obligation  to take over all of the related company s rights and obligations under its contract with the customer  if a demand by the customer under the contract with the related company ever occurs and remains unsatisfied 
although we believe that we will not be required to make any payments under the guaranty agreement  we believe that the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted we could be required to make would be approximately million over the year term of the contract 
commercial commitments our lenders issue letters of credit on our behalf to customers or sureties in connection with our contract performance and in limited circumstances certain other obligations to third parties 
we are required to reimburse the issuers of these letters of credit for any payments which they make pursuant to these letters of credit 
at august   we had both letter of credit commitments and bonding obligations  which were generally issued to secure performance and financial obligations on certain of our construction contracts  which expire as follows in millions amounts of commitment expiration by period less than commercial commitments total year years years after years letters of credit domestic and foreign surety bonds total commercial commitments note commercial commitments above exclude any letters of credit or surety bonding obligations associated with outstanding bids or proposals or other work not awarded prior to august  at august   we had both letter of credit commitments and bonding obligations as follows in millions amounts of commitment expiration by period less than commercial commitments total year years years after years letters of credit domestic and foreign surety bonds total commercial commitments 
table of contents note commercial commitments above exclude any letters of credit or surety bonding obligations associated with outstanding bids or proposals or other work not awarded prior to august  the million increase in letters of credit reflects a new letter of credit for approximately million for a new epc project and additional letters of credit for an existing project that we issued in exchange for the release of escrowed cash of approximately million 
surety bonds of million at august  remained consistent with the million at august  fees related to these commercial commitments were million and million  and were recorded in the accompanying statements of operations for fiscal and  respectively 
these fees have significantly increased due to a higher letter of credit outstanding balance under our credit facility as well as higher surety fees due to the overall current insurance market and the decrease in our bond rating in fiscal during fiscal  we made three payments totaling million to reimburse issuers of our letters of credit which had a negative impact on our working capital and cash position 
in the fourth quarter fiscal  million was subsequently returned by the customer as a result of negotiations to continue the project and our agreement to post a million letter of credit 
during fiscal  customers who had been issued letters of credit in connection with certain contracts received payments under outstanding letters of credit of million which we reimbursed our lenders 
there were no such payments in fiscal of the amount of outstanding letters of credit at august   million are issued to customers in connection with contracts 
of this amount  million customers held million or of outstanding letters of credit related to five contracts 
the largest single amount of outstanding letters of credit issued to a single customer on a single project is million 
aggregate contractual obligations as of august  we had the following contractual obligations in millions payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations as of august   we had the following contractual obligations in millions payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the reduction in long term debt reflects the repurchase of lyons with a book value totaling million at various dates of repurchase during fiscal capital lease obligations have increased due to our eds acquisition on december  while operating leases have increased slightly due to our eds acquisition and general operating needs during fiscal see note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of long term debt and leases

recent accounting pronouncements fin consolidation of variable interest entities and fin implementation issues fin r in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting series interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities which was revised in december to address certain fin implementation issues fin r 
this interpretation requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  limited liability company llc  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either has insufficient financial support  has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities  or has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 
the interpretation also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that we are not required to consolidate but in which we have a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and is effective for existing variable interest entities for the period ending may  effective  may  we implemented fin r 
as of august   the total assets and liabilities before intercompany eliminations of those vies for which we are the primary beneficiary were approximately million and million  respectively 
the total assets and liabilities of those vies that we are not the primary beneficiary were approximately million and million  respectively  as of august  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our vies 
fasb exposure draft share based payment  an amendment of fasb statement no 
and apb no 
on march   the fasb published an exposure draft  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statement no 
and apb no 
the proposed change in accounting would replace the existing requirements under fas no 
and apb no 
under the proposal  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options and employee stock purchase plans  would be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of income 
this proposed statement would eliminate the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method of apb no 
and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method  with a binomial or lattice model preferred to the black scholes valuation model 
the comment period for the exposure draft ended june  we are currently analyzing what impact  if any  the adoption of the exposure draft  if issued as a final standard  will have on our financial position and results of operations in fiscal effects of inflation we expect to continue to focus our operations on cost reimbursable and negotiated fixed price contracts 
to the extent that a significant portion of our revenues are earned under cost reimbursable type contracts  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations should be reduced 
however  if we expand our business into markets and geographical areas where fixed price work is more prevalent  inflation may begin to have a larger impact on our results of operations 
to the extent permitted by competition  we expect to continue to emphasize contracts that are either cost reimbursable or negotiated fixed price 
for contracts where we accept with fixed price terms  we monitor closely the actual costs on the project as they compare to the budget estimates 
on these projects  we also attempt to secure fixed price commitments from key subcontractors and vendors 
however  due to the competitive nature of our industry  combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel  equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts  there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our result of operations in the future 
risk factors 
table of contents investing in our common stock will provide an investor with an equity ownership interest 
shareholders will be subject to risks inherent in our business 
the performance of our shares will reflect the performance of our business relative to  among other things  general economic and industry conditions  market conditions and competition 
the value of the investment may increase or decrease and could result in a loss 
an investor should carefully consider the following factors as well as other information contained in this form k  including the discussion of our critical accounting polices  before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
this form k also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including the risk factors described below and the other factors described elsewhere in this form k 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns in the industries to which we market our products and services 
the demand for our products and services depends on conditions in the environmental and infrastructure industries and the power generation industry which accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our backlog as of august   and  to a lesser extent  on conditions in the petrochemical  chemical and refining industries 
these industries historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the domestic and international economies 
for example  since fiscal  there has been a slowdown in construction activity and new construction awards for power generation projects  primarily as a result of less activity by certain independent power producers who had encountered financing and liquidity problems 
these factors contributed to the cancellation or suspension of a number of projects by our customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in a reduction of our backlog at that time  with depressed activity during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  resulting in a decrease in our revenues  backlog and awards of new business 
our results of operations have varied and may continue to vary depending on the demand for future projects from these industries 
the dollar amount of our backlog  as stated at any given time  is not necessarily indicative of our future earnings 
as of august   our backlog was approximately billion 
there can be no assurance that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or  if realized  will result in profits 
further  project terminations  suspensions or adjustments in scope may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog 
for example  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  three domestic power projects previously reflected in our backlog were suspended or cancelled  resulting in a reduction of our backlog of approximately million 
reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer or for other reasons adversely affect  potentially to a material extent  the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts projected in backlog 
in the event of project cancellation  we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog 
in addition  projects may remain in our backlog for extended periods of time 
if we were to experience significant cancellations or delays of projects in our backlog  our financial condition could be significantly adversely affected 
we define backlog as a working backlog which includes projects for which we have received a commitment from our customers 
this commitment may be in the form of a written contract for a specific project  a purchase order or an indication of the amount of time or material we need to make available for a customer s anticipated project 
in certain instances  the engagement is for a particular product or project for which we estimate anticipated revenue  often based on engineering and design specifications that have not been finalized and may be revised over time 
also  we estimate based on our prior experience the amount of future work we will receive for multi year government contracts for which funding is approved on an annual or periodic basis during the term of the contract 
in the e i segment  many of these contracts are multi year indefinite delivery order  or ido  agreements with the federal government 
these contracts do not initially provide for a specific amount of work  and we derive the contract backlog of ido agreements from our historical experience with similar awards and customers  and such backlog averages approximately of the total unfunded awards 

table of contents estimates are reviewed periodically and appropriate adjustments are made to the amounts included in backlog and in unexercised contract options 
our backlog does not include any awards funded or unfunded for work expected to be performed more than five years after the date of our financial statements 
the amount of future actual awards may be more or less than our estimates 
our backlog for maintenance work is derived from maintenance contracts  some of which do not specify actual dollar amounts of maintenance work  in which case our backlog is based on an estimate of work to be performed in light of such customers historic maintenance requirements 
accordingly  the amount of future actual awards may be more or less than our estimates 
we also include in backlog commitments from certain individual customers that have committed to more than one significant epc project and other customers who have committed to multi year orders for environmental  piping or maintenance services 
there can be no assurance that the customers will complete all of these projects or that the projects will be performed in the currently anticipated time frame 
our significant engineering  procurement and construction projects may encounter difficulties that may result in additional costs to us  reductions in revenues or the payment of actual and or liquidated damages 
our epc projects generally involve complex design and engineering  significant procurement of equipment and supplies  and extensive construction management 
many of our epc projects involve design  engineering  procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods  often in excess of two years 
we may encounter difficulties in the design or engineering  equipment and supply delivery  schedule changes  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule 
in addition  we generally rely on third party equipment manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of epc contracts 
in come cases  the equipment we purchase for a project or that is provided to us by the customer does not perform as expected  and these performance failures may result in delays in completion of the project or additional costs to us or the customer to complete the project and  in some cases  may require us to obtain alternate equipment at additional cost 
any delay by subcontractors to complete their portion of the project  or any failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project  and other factors beyond our control may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs  or both 
these delays and additional costs may be substantial  and we may be required to compensate the project customer for these delays 
while we may recover these additional costs from the responsible vendor  subcontractor or other third party  we may not be able to recover all of these costs in all circumstances 
for example  we recorded a million pre tax loss million  net of tax for the first quarter of fiscal relating to two epc projects for gas fired combined cycle power plants in michigan and arizona 
the charges were the result of project completion delays 
in addition  we have been assessed liquidated damages by the owners due to such delays 
we believe that such project completion delays were primarily attributable to our vendors  subcontractors and equipment manufacturers from whom we may recover certain costs 
however  there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional costs we incurred as a result of such project completion delays 
recovery of these amounts is dependent upon our negotiations  arbitration and litigation with the owners  subcontractors  vendors and equipment manufacturers 
we are also currently involved in litigation with a customer and a third party subcontractor relating to the engineering  design  procurement and construction of a gas fired  combined cycle power plant in texas 
in this litigation we are seeking payment from the customer for additional costs incurred by us as a result of a fire at the construction site and certain misrepresentations and we are seeking payment from a third party equipment vendor for additional costs and liquidated damages potentially payable by us as a result of the failure of a turbine during start up testing 
to the extent we do not receive these amounts  we will recognize a charge to earnings 
for further information regarding current legal disputes in which we are currently involved  see item legal proceedings in our annual report on form k for the year ended august  in addition  certain contracts may require that our customers provide us with design or engineering information or with equipment or materials to be used on the project 
in some cases  the customer may provide us with deficient design or engineering information or equipment or may provide the information or equipment to us later than required by the project schedule 
the customer may also determine  after commencement of the project  to change various elements of the project 
our epc project contracts generally require the customer to compensate us for additional work or expenses incurred due to customer requested change orders or failure of the customer to provide us with specified design or engineering information or equipment 
under these circumstances  we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us 
we are subject to the risk that we are unable to obtain  through negotiation  arbitration  litigation or otherwise  adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to customer requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely provide required items 
a failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record an adjustment to amounts of revenue and gross profit that were 
table of contents recognized in prior periods 
any such adjustments  if substantial  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as is more fully discussed in critical accounting policies and related estimates that have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  a substantial portion of our revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion  or poc  method of accounting 
this accounting method is standard for engineering  procurement and construction  or epc  contracts 
the poc accounting practices that we use result in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined  and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
further  a substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from the contracts  and adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded when known or finalized  which is generally during the latter stages of the contract 
in addition  we record claims when we believe recovery or payment is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
actual collection or payment of claims could differ from estimated amounts 
although a significant portion of our contracts are cost reimbursable and our financial loss exposure on cost reimbursable contracts is generally limited  it is possible that the loss provisions or adjustments to the contract profit and loss resulting from future changes in our estimates or contract penalty provisions could be significant and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings or result in losses 
in certain circumstances it is possible that such adjustments could be material to our operating results 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions that we use to prepare our financial statements 
to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make estimates and assumptions  as of the date of the financial statements  which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
areas requiring significant estimates by our management include contract costs and profits and application of percentage of completion accounting and revenue recognition of contract claims  recoverability of inventory and application of lower of cost or market accounting  provisions for uncollectible receivables and customer claims and recoveries of costs from subcontractors  vendors and others  provisions for income taxes and related valuation allowances  recoverability of goodwill  recoverability of other intangibles and related estimated lives  valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations  valuation of defined benefit pension plans  and accruals for estimated liabilities  including litigation and insurance reserves 
our actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents non compliance with covenants in our credit facility  without waiver or amendment from the lenders of the credit facility  could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
our credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a leverage ratio which becomes more restrictive over time  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a defined minimum net worth  a minimum working capital ratio  a limit on capital expenditures  and defined minimum earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
in addition  the defined terms used in calculating the financial covenants  in accordance with the credit facility  often require us to follow generally accepted accounting principles which requires the use of judgments and estimates  and may change from time to time based on new accounting pronouncements 
we may not be able to satisfy these ratios  especially if our operating results fall below management s expectations as a result of  but not limited to  the impact of other risk factors that may have a negative impact on our future earnings 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our credit facility 
a future breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amendments 
in the event of any default under our credit facility not otherwise amended  the lenders thereunder will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us and could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be due and payable  or require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings and cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit at that time 
the acceleration of outstanding loans under our credit facility in excess of million constitutes an event of default with respect to the senior notes 
if we are unable to repay borrowings with respect to our credit facility when due  the lenders thereunder could proceed against their collateral  which consists of substantially all of our assets  including property  equipment and real estate 
if the indebtedness under our credit facility or the senior notes were to be accelerated  we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 
as of august   we did not have outstanding borrowings under the credit facility but had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million and indebtedness under our senior notes of million 
in addition  although our senior notes contain no cross default provisions  we have entered into indemnity agreements with our sureties that do contain cross default provisions 
accordingly  in the event of a default under our credit facility  we would need to obtain a waiver or amendment to these provisions 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in obtaining any such amendment or waiver 
restrictive covenants in our credit facility and the indenture relating to the senior notes may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies 
our credit facility and the indenture relating to the senior notes contain certain restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness or contingent obligations or issue preferred stock  pay dividends or make distributions to our shareholders  repurchase or redeem our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments  create liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us  make capital expenditures  
table of contents enter into transactions with our stockholders and affiliates  sell assets  and acquire the assets of  or merge or consolidate with  other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facility requires us to achieve certain financial ratios  including a leverage ratio which becomes more restrictive over time and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we may not be able to satisfy these ratios  especially if our operating results fall below management s expectations 
in addition  in order to remain in compliance with the covenants in our credit facility  we may be limited in our flexibility to take actions resulting in non cash charges  including as a result of our settling claims 
these covenants may impair our ability to engage in favorable business activities and our ability to finance future operations or capital needs 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our credit facility 
see risk factor  non compliance with covenants in our credit facility without  waiver or amendment from the lenders of the credit facility  could adversely affect our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill our obligations under our senior notes and our credit facility 
as of august  we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  approximately million of which was secured indebtedness  including obligations under capital leases 
in addition  as of august   letters of credit  domestic and foreign  issued for our account in an aggregate amount of million were outstanding 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences  including the following it will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  including our outstanding senior notes due  or senior notes  reducing the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  it will limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements and other purposes  it will limit our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business  it may place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  it may make us more vulnerable to a further downturn in the economy of our business  and it may restrict us from making additional acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities 
to the extent that new debt is added to our currently anticipated debt levels  the substantial leverage risks described above would increase 
we are currently the subject of an informal inquiry by the sec 
on june  we were notified by the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec that the staff is conducting an informal inquiry relating to the company 
the sec has not advised us as to either the reason for the inquiry or its scope 
if the inquiry elevates to a formal investigation  the resolution could have a material adverse effect on us and result in increased review and scrutiny of us by regulatory authorities  civil or injunctive proceedings  and 
table of contents possible payment of fines and penalties 
we cannot provide any guarantees as to the outcome of this informal inquiry 
we have been named in various purported class action shareholder lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits 
the company  our directors and certain of our current and former officers have been named as defendants in various purported class action shareholder lawsuits and shareholder derivative lawsuits 
a discussion of these lawsuits appears in item legal proceedings in our annual report on form k for the year ended august  although it is not possible at this early stage to predict the likely outcome of these actions  an adverse result in any of these lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are and will continue to be involved in litigation 
we have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects and other matters 
these are typically actions that arise in the normal course of business  including employment related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occurs in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites 
our contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the performance of equipment  design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by our subsidiaries 
to date  we have been able to obtain liability insurance for the operation of our business 
however  if we sustain damages that materially exceed our insurance coverage or that are not insured  there could be a material adverse effect on our liquidity  which could impair our operations 
downgrades by rating agencies in the fourth quarter of  moody s investors service or moody s lowered its rating of our guaranteed senior unsecured notes or senior notes to ba from ba and the rating on our credit facility to ba from ba along with downgrading the company s outlook to negative from stable 
moody s indicated that these ratings were lowered primarily due to weaker than expected earnings and cash flow along with persistent charges related to certain contracts during fiscal and see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of charges related to the neg projects 
in the event our debt ratings are lowered by moody s investors service or standard and poor s in the future  we may not comply with our bonding facilities which could impact our ability to obtain bonding for new projects in the future and we may be required to increase or provide cash collateral to obtain surety bonds in order to obtain bonding for new projects in the future  which would reduce our available cash or availability under our credit facility 
we anticipate that any such new or modified bonding facilities would not be on terms as attractive as those we have currently and that we would also be subject to increased costs of capital and interest rates 
the nature of our contracts could adversely affect us 
although approximately of our backlog as of august  was from cost reimbursable contracts  the remaining was from fixed price or unit price contracts 
a significant number of our domestic piping contracts and substantially all of our international piping contracts are fixed price or unit price 
in addition  a number of the contracts we assumed in the stone webster and it group acquisitions were fixed price contracts  and we will continue to enter into these types of contracts in the future 
under fixed price or unit price contracts  we agree to perform the contract for a fixed price and  as a result  benefit from costs savings and earnings from approved change orders  but we are generally unable to recover any cost overruns to the approved contract price 
under certain incentive contracts  we share with the customer any savings up to a negotiated or target ceiling 
when costs exceed the negotiated ceiling price  we may be required to reduce our fee or to absorb some or all of the cost overruns 
contract prices are established based in part on cost estimates that are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding future economic conditions 
if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change  cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of our operations 
our profit for these projects could decrease or we could experience losses if we are unable to secure fixed pricing commitments from our suppliers at the time the contracts are entered into or if we experience cost increases for material or labor during 
table of contents the performance of the contracts 
we enter into contractual agreements with customers for some of our engineering  procurement and construction services to be performed based on agreed upon reimbursable costs and labor rates 
some of these contracts provide for the customer s review of the accounting and cost control systems to verify the completeness and accuracy of the reimbursable costs invoiced 
these reviews could result in reductions in reimbursable costs and labor rates previously billed to the customer 
many of our contracts require us to satisfy specified design  engineering  procurement or construction milestones in order to receive payment for the work completed or equipment or supplies procured prior to achievement of the applicable milestone 
as a result  under these types of arrangements  we may incur significant costs or perform significant amounts of services prior to receipt of payment 
if the customer determines not to proceed with the completion of the project or if the customer defaults on its payment obligations  we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended to purchase equipment or supplies 
in addition  many of our customers for large epc projects are project specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the epc project 
it may be difficult for us to collect amounts owed to us by these customers against the customer s more credit worthy parent company 
if we are unable to collect amounts owed to us for these matters  we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 
we are subject to the risks associated with being a government contractor 
we are a major provider of services to governmental agencies and therefore are exposed to risks associated with government contracting  including reductions in government spending  cancelled or delayed appropriations specific to our projects  heightened competition and modified or terminated contracts 
for example  most of our government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process 
some government contracts are awarded to multiple competitors  which increases overall competition and pricing pressure and may require us to make sustained post award efforts to realize revenues under these government contracts 
legislatures typically appropriate funds for a given program on a year by year basis  even though contract performance may take more than one year and are not always guaranteed 
as a result  at the beginning of a project  the related contract may be only partially funded  and additional funding is normally committed only as appropriations are made in each subsequent year 
these appropriations  and the timing of payment of appropriated amounts  may be influenced by  among other things  the state of the economy  competing political priorities  curtailments in the use of government contracting firms  budget constraints  the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures 
if legislative appropriations are not made in subsequent years of a multiple year contract  we will not realize all of our potential revenues and profits from that contract 
a reduction in spending by federal government agencies could also limit our ability to obtain additional contracts  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  government customers typically can terminate or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience  and some of these government contracts are subject to renewal or extension annually 
if a government customer terminates a contract or fails to renew or extend a contract  our backlog may be reduced or we may incur a loss  either of which could impair our financial condition and operating results 
for the year ended august   of revenue was generated from us governmental agencies 
a termination due to our unsatisfactory performance could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in cases where we are a subcontractor  the prime contract under which we are a subcontractor could be terminated  regardless of the quality of our services as a subcontractor or our relationship with the relevant government agency 
our government customers can also reduce the value of existing contracts  issue modifications to a contract and control and potentially prohibit the export of our services and associated materials 
as a result of our government contracting business  we have been  are and will be in the future  the subject of audits and or cost reviews by the defense contract audit agency  which we refer to as dcaa  or by other contracting agencies 
additionally  we have been and may in the future be the subject of investigations by governmental agencies such as the office of inspector general of the environmental protection agency 
during the course of an audit  the dcaa may disallow costs if it determines that we improperly accounted for such costs in a manner inconsistent with cost accounting standards or regulatory and contractual requirements 
under the type of cost 
table of contents reimbursable government contracts that we typically perform  only those costs that are reasonable  allocable and allowable are recoverable under the federal acquisition regulation and cost accounting standards 
in addition  our failure to comply with the terms of one or more of our government contracts  other government agreements  or government regulations and statutes could result in our being suspended or barred from future government contract projects for a significant period of time and possible civil or criminal fines and penalties of applicable regulations and statutes and the risk of public scrutiny of our performance at high profile sites 
this could materially adversely affect our business 
our failure to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts could adversely affect us 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee facility completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any such schedule or performance requirements could result in additional costs  and the amount of such additional costs could exceed projected profit margins 
performance problems for existing and future contracts could cause actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated by us and could cause us to suffer damage to our reputation within our industry and our client base 
our dependence on subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could adversely affect us 
we rely on third party equipment manufacturers as well as third party subcontractors to complete our projects 
to the extent that we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  our ability to complete a project in a timely fashion or at a profit may be impaired 
if the amount we are required to pay for these goods and services exceeds the amount we have estimated in bidding for fixed price work  we could experience losses in the performance of these contracts 
in addition  if a subcontractor or a manufacturer is unable to deliver its services  equipment or materials according to the negotiated terms for any reason  including the deterioration of its financial condition  we may be required to purchase the services  equipment or materials from another source at a higher price 
this may reduce the profit to be realized or result in a loss on a project for which the services  equipment or materials were needed 
possible cost escalation associated with our fixed price contracts which could impact our profitability 
we estimate total contract costs in pricing our fixed price contracts incorporating assumptions to address inflation and fluctuations in market price for materials 
however  we can not predict these variable components with certainty as they related to our pricing of fixed price contracts 
as a result  we may incur total costs that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs 
these increased costs could contribute to a lower than expected return or losses on our projects 
our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 
a substantial portion of our revenues is directly or indirectly derived from large scale domestic and international projects 
it is generally very difficult to predict whether and when we will receive such awards as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors  such as market conditions  financing arrangements  governmental approvals and environmental matters 
because a significant portion of our revenues is generated from large projects  our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards 
in addition  many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and  as a result  we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 
in certain circumstances  customers may require us to provide credit enhancements  including bonds or letters of credit 
in line with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance and surety bonds to customers 
these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract 
if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond  we cannot pursue that project 
we have a bonding facility but  as is typically the case  the issuance of bonds under that facility is at the surety s sole discretion 
moreover  due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally  bonding may be more 
table of contents difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost 
there can be no assurance that bonds will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms 
our inability to obtain adequate bonding and  as a result  to bid on new work could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and business prospects 
the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs 
in some cases  we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than called for under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards 
if an expected contract award is delayed or not received  we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  our significant customers vary between years  and the loss of any one or more of our key customers could have a material adverse impact on us 
in addition  timing of the revenues  earnings and cash flows from our projects can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including unavoidable delays from weather conditions  unavailability of material and equipment from vendors  changes in the scope of services requested by clients or labor disruptions 
our environmental and infrastructure operations may subject us to potential contractual and operational costs and liabilities 
many of our e i segment customers attempt to shift financial and operating risks to the contractor  particularly on projects involving large scale cleanups and or projects where there may be a risk that the contamination could be more extensive or difficult to resolve than previously anticipated 
in this competitive market  customers increasingly try to pressure contractors to accept greater risks of performance  liability for damage or injury to third parties or property and liability for fines and penalties 
prior to our acquisition of the it group  it was involved in claims and litigation involving disputes over such issues 
therefore  it is possible that we could also become involved in similar claims and litigation in the future as a result of our acquisition of the assets of it group and our participation in environmental and infrastructure contracts 
environmental management contractors also potentially face liabilities to third parties for property damage or personal injury stemming from exposure to or a release of toxic substances resulting from a project performed for customers 
these liabilities could arise long after completion of a project 
although the risks we face in our anthrax and other biological agent work are similar to those faced in our toxic chemical emergency response business  the risks posed by attempting to detect and remediate these biological agents may include risks to our employees  subcontractors and those who may be affected should detection and remediation prove less effective than anticipated 
because anthrax and similar contamination is so recent  there may be unknown risks involved  and in certain circumstances there may be no body of knowledge or standard protocols for dealing with these risks 
the risks we face also include the potential ineffectiveness of developing technologies to detect and remediate the contamination  claims for infringement of these technologies  difficulties in working with the smaller  specialized firms that may own these technologies and have detection and remediation capabilities  our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and subcontractors in light of these risks  the high profile nature of the work and the potential unavailability of insurance and indemnification for the risks associated with biological agents and terrorism 
over the past several years  the epa and other federal agencies have constricted significantly the circumstances under which they will indemnify their contractors against liabilities incurred in connection with cercla  and similar projects 
we are exposed to certain risks associated with our integrated environmental solutions businesses 
certain subsidiaries within our environmental infrastructure division are engaged in two similar programs that may involve assumption of a client s environmental remediation obligations and potential claim obligations 
one program involves our subsidiary  the landbank group  inc  or landbank  which was acquired in the it group acquisition 
under this program  landbank purchases and then remediates and or takes other steps to improve environmentally impaired properties 
the second program is operated by our subsidiary shaw environmental liability solutions  llc  which will contractually assume responsibility for environmental matters at a particular site or sites and provide indemnifications for defined cleanup costs and post closing third party claims in return for compensation by the client 
these subsidiaries may operate and or purchase and redevelop environmentally 
table of contents impaired property 
as the owner or operator of such properties  we may be required to clean up all contamination at these sites even if we did not place the contamination there 
we attempt to reduce our exposure to unplanned risks through the performance of environmental due diligence  the use of liability protection provisions of federal laws like the brownfields revitalization act and similar state laws and the purchase of environmental and cost cap insurance coverage or other risk management products 
however  we cannot assure you that our risk management strategies and these products and laws will adequately protect us in all circumstances or that no material adverse impact will occur 
our ability to be profitable in this type of business also depends on our ability to accurately estimate cleanup costs 
while we engage in comprehensive engineering and cost analyses  if we were to materially underestimate the required cost of cleanup at a particular project  such underestimation could significantly adversely affect us 
further  the continued growth of this type of business is dependent upon the availability of environmental and cost cap insurance or other risk management products 
we cannot assure you that such products will continue to be available to us in the future 
moreover  environmental laws and regulations governing the cleanup of contaminated sites are constantly changing 
we cannot predict the effect of future changes to these laws and regulations on our landbank and environmental liability solutions businesses 
in addition  prior to the it group acquisition  we had not previously conducted this type of business and we have had no material transactions in this business 
additionally  when we purchase real estate in this business  we are subject to many of the same risks as real estate developers  including the timely receipt of building and zoning permits  construction delays  the ability of markets to absorb new development projects  market fluctuations and the ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing on satisfactory terms  among others 
the limitation or the expiration of the price anderson act s indemnification authority could adversely affect our business 
the price anderson act  or paa  comprehensively regulates the manufacture  use and storage of radioactive materials  while promoting the nuclear power industry by offering broad indemnification to nuclear power plant operators and doe contractors 
because we provide services for the doe relating to its nuclear weapons facilities and the nuclear power industry in the on going maintenance and modification  as well as decontamination and decommissioning  of its nuclear power plants  we are entitled to the indemnification protections under the paa 
although the paa s indemnification provisions are broad  it does not apply to all liabilities that we might incur while performing services as a radioactive materials cleanup contractor for the doe and the nuclear power industry 
in addition  the paa s ability to indemnify us with respect to any new facilities expired on august   but was reauthorized and extended through december  because nuclear power remains controversial  there can be no assurance that the paa s indemnification authority will be reauthorized and extended when that authority expires again at the end of calendar year if the paa s indemnification authority is not extended  our business could be adversely affected by either a refusal of operations of new facilities to retain us or our inability to obtain commercially adequate insurance and indemnification 
environmental factors and changes in laws and regulations could increase our costs and liabilities and affect the demand for our services 
in addition to the environmental risks described above relating to the businesses acquired from it group and our environmental remediation business  our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations  including those concerning emissions into the air  discharges into waterways  generation  storage  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  and health and safety 
our projects often involve highly regulated materials  including hazardous and nuclear materials and wastes 
environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for regulated materials and require 
table of contents us to obtain a permit and comply with various other requirements 
the improper characterization  handling  or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure to comply with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations or associated environmental permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil  and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to perform 
in addition  under cercla and comparable state laws  we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated materials 
cercla and these comparable state laws typically impose liability without regard to whether a company knew of or caused the release  and liability for the entire cost of clean up can be imposed upon any responsible party 
the principal federal environmental legislation affecting our environmental infrastructure subsidiaries and clients include the national environmental policy act of  or nepa  the resource conservation and recovery act of  or rcra  the clean air act  the federal water pollution control act  and cercla  together with the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of  or sara 
our foreign operations are also subject to similar governmental controls and restrictions relating to environmental protection 
we could also incur environmental liability at sites where we have been hired by potentially responsible parties  or prps  to remediate contamination of the site 
such prps have sought to expand the reach of cercla  rcra and similar state statutes to make the remediation contractor responsible for cleanup costs 
these companies claim that environmental contractors are owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities or that the contractors arranged for treatment  transportation or disposal of hazardous substances 
if we are held responsible under cercla or rcra for damages caused while performing services or otherwise  we may be forced to incur such cleanup costs by ourselves  notwithstanding the potential availability of contribution or indemnification from other parties 
the environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject are constantly changing  and it is impossible to predict the effect of any future changes to these laws and regulations on us 
we do not yet know the full extent  if any  of environmental liabilities associated with many of our recently acquired properties undergoing or scheduled to undergo site restoration  including any liabilities associated with the assets we acquired from stone webster and it group 
we cannot assure you that our operations will continue to comply with future laws and regulations will not significantly adversely affect us 
the level of enforcement of these laws and regulations also affects the demand for many of our services 
proposed changes in regulations and the perception that enforcement of current environmental laws has been reduced has decreased the demand for some services  as clients have anticipated and adjusted to the potential changes 
future changes could result in increased or decreased demand for some of our services 
the ultimate impact of the proposed changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the economy and clients views on the cost effectiveness of remedies available under the changed regulations 
if proposed or enacted changes materially reduce demand for our environmental services  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
development and construction risks and other risks associated with our military housing privatization contracts could impact our profitability and a loss of our investment 
development and construction activities conducted through various joint ventures with one strategic partner expose us to risks including we may be unable to obtain  or may be subject to delays in obtaining necessary permitting  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs  we may incur construction costs related to new construction or renovations that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs 
these increased costs could contribute to a lower than expected return and we may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increased in construction costs annually  we may be unable to complete construction of a property on schedule and meet financial goals for development factors  and 
table of contents we may incur construction costs that are higher or have project delays if we are not successful in our ability to form strategic alliances with key material suppliers and vendors 
other risks directly associated with our dependence on the us military include we may be unable to obtain the necessary levels of occupancy and rents  which could result in lower than expected returns and in some cases losses 
rents are determined by congress annually through appropriations for basic allowance for housing bah for all of the branches of the us military 
we cannot assure you that the appropriations each year will occur on a timely basis  or that the amount of bah appropriations will be sufficient to keep up with escalations in the cost of living expenses 
congress may change the law and the dod can revise its procedures at any time 
we cannot assure you that such changes will not be made and  if changes are made  such changes may have a material adverse effect on the level of our operating revenues generated by our privatization projects  we cannot assure you that the military bases where we have military housing projects will remain active or that their functions and or staffing levels will not be materially reduced such that we will be unable to lease military housing units to members of the us military 
the dod has  from time to time  closed military bases and realigned and or reduced the functions and staffing levels at certain bases under the base realignment and closure brac initiative 
these military housing projects are supported by military residents based on current military needs and geographic deployment of the residents  and we may not be able to close on our five remaining military housing privatization projects as we have only been selected to receive the right to enter into exclusive negotiations and the award is subject to final approval from the us military branch and congress 
until final approval is obtained  which generally can last between six months to one year  we will incur costs associated with the development plan and design that may be significant 
we cannot assure you that we will receive final approval and failure to recover these development costs may result in losses 
ultimately  these risks could have an adverse effect on our profitability and expose us to possible losses as well as the loss of our investment in these military housing privatizations 
as of august   our investment in these housing privatizations was million 
our working capital requirements may increase as a result of our entry into the military housing privatization market 
during fiscal  we were awarded seven contracts to privatize military family housing with our joint venture partner  cei  under the dod s military housing privatization initiative 
as of august   two of these contracts were closed with the other five scheduled to close in fiscal these privatization contracts require initial capital contributions in the early stages of the project and ultimately permanent financing from a third party lender 
as of august   we are obligated to make capital contributions of approximately million related to these privatization contracts  however  the timing of these capital contributions are dependent upon the progress of each underlying project 
in addition  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed property may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  we may be unable to meet our profitability goals for that property 
if our partners fail to perform their contractual obligations on a project  we could be exposed to loss of reputation and additional financial performance obligations that could result in reduced profits or losses 
we often enter into various joint ventures as part of our environmental and engineering  procurement and construction businesses so that we can jointly bid and perform on a particular project 
the success of these and other joint ventures depends  in large part  on the satisfactory performance of the contractual obligations of our joint venture partners 
if our partners do not meet their obligations  the joint venture may be unable to adequately perform and deliver its contracted services 
under these circumstances  we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services 
these 
table of contents additional obligations could result in reduced profits or  in some cases  significant losses for us with respect to the joint venture  which could also affect our reputation in the industries we serve 
our dependence on one or a few customers could adversely affect us 
due to the size of many engineering and construction projects  one or a few clients have in the past and may in the future contribute a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years 
for example  in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were generated from ten major customers 
similarly  our backlog frequently reflects multiple projects for individual clients  therefore  one major customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a point in time 
an example of this is the tva  with which we have two contracts representing an aggregate of of our backlog at august  including our backlog from tva  a government owned entity  backlog from the us government or us government owned entities accounted for of backlog at august  because these significant customers generally contract with us for specific projects  we may lose these customers from year to year as their projects with us are completed 
if we do not replace them with other customers or other projects  our business could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  we have long standing relationships with many significant customers  including customers with which we have alliance agreements that have preferred pricing arrangements 
however  our contracts with these customers are on a project by project basis  and they may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their purchases at any time 
the loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
if we experience delays and or defaults in customer payments  we could be unable to recover all expenditures 
because of the nature of our contracts  at times we commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on client projects as they are incurred 
delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment 
if a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources  it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations 
our projects expose us to potential professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims 
we engineer  construct and perform services in large industrial facilities in which accidents or system failures can be disastrous 
any catastrophic occurrences in excess of insurance limits at locations engineered or constructed by us or where our products are installed or services performed could result in significant professional liability  product liability  warranty and other claims against us 
in addition  under some of our contracts  we must use new metals or processes for producing or fabricating pipe for our customers 
the failure of any of these metals or processes could result in warranty claims against us for significant replacement or reworking costs 
further  the engineering and construction projects we perform expose us to additional risks including cost overruns  equipment failures  personal injuries  property damage  shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor disputes  weather problems and unforeseen engineering  architectural  environmental and geological problems 
in addition  once our construction is complete  we may face claims with respect to the performance of these facilities 
we face substantial competition in each of our business segments 
in our e i segment  we compete with a diverse array of small and large organizations  including national and regional environmental management firms  national  regional and local architectural  engineering and construction firms  environmental management divisions or subsidiaries of international engineering  construction and systems companies  and waste generators that have developed in house capabilities 
increased competition in this business  combined with changes in client procurement procedures  has resulted in changes in the industry  including among other things  lower contract margins  more fixed price or unit price contracts and contract terms that may increasingly require us to indemnify our clients against damages or injuries to third parties and property and environmental fines and penalties 
we believe  therefore  these market conditions may require us to accept more 
table of contents contractual and performance risk than we have historically for the environmental and infrastructure segment to be competitive 
the entry of large systems contractors and international engineering and construction firms into the environmental services industry has increased competition for major federal government contracts and programs  which have been a primary source of revenue in recent years for our environmental infrastructure business 
there can be no assurance that our e i segment will be able to compete successfully given the intense competition and trends in its industry 
in our ecm segment  we face competition from numerous regional  national and international competitors  many of which have greater financial and other resources than we do 
our competitors include well established  well financed concerns  both privately and publicly held  including many major power equipment manufacturers and engineering and construction companies  some engineering companies  internal engineering departments at utilities and certain of our customers 
the markets that we serve require substantial resources and particularly highly skilled and experienced technical personnel 
in our fabrication  manufacturing and distribution segment  we face substantial competition on a domestic and international level 
in the united states  there are a number of smaller pipe fabricators 
internationally  our principal competitors are divisions of large industrial firms 
some of our competitors  primarily in the international sector  have greater financial and other resources than we do 
political and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us 
approximately of our fiscal revenues and of our revenues for fiscal were attributable to projects in international markets  some of which are subject to political unrest and uncertainty 
we have operations in the middle east  russia  china  europe and australia 
the services we provide to our customers in iraq and other middle east countries have created several challenges  including identifying and retaining the appropriate subcontractors  the recruiting of qualified personnel and the ability to retain them  the safety of our employees and subcontractors and the increased working capital demands 
it is possible that our employees may suffer injury or death  repatriation problems or other unforeseen costs and risks in the course of their international projects  which could negatively impact our operations 
in addition to these specific challenges we face in the middle east  international contracts  operations and expansion expose us to risks inherent in doing business outside the united states  including uncertain economic conditions in the foreign countries in which we make capital investments  operate and sell products and services  the lack of well developed legal systems in some countries in which we operate and sell products and services  which could make it difficult for us to enforce our contractual rights  security and safety of employees  expropriation of property  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency  political risks  including risks of loss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  currency fluctuations  logistical and communications challenges  
table of contents potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  changes in labor conditions  exposure to liability under the foreign corrupt practices act  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
work stoppages and other labor problems could adversely affect us 
some of our employees in the united states and abroad are represented by labor unions 
we experienced a strike  without material impact on pipe production  by union members in february relating to the termination of collective bargaining agreements covering our pipe facilities in walker and prairieville  louisiana 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at any of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
from time to time we have also experienced attempts to unionize our non union shops 
while these efforts have achieved limited success to date  we cannot give any assurance that we will not experience additional union activity in the future 
adverse events could negatively affect our liquidity position 
our operations could require us to utilize large sums of working capital  sometimes on short notice and sometimes without the ability to recover the expenditures 
circumstances or events which could create large cash outflows include losses resulting from fixed price contracts  environmental liabilities  litigation risks  unexpected costs or losses resulting from acquisitions  contract initiation or completion delays  political conditions  customer payment problems  foreign exchange risks  professional and product liability claims  among others 
we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity or the credit capacity to meet all of our cash needs if we encounter significant working capital requirements as a result of these or other factors 
insufficient liquidity could have important consequences to us 
for example  we could have less operating flexibility due to restrictions which could be imposed by our creditors  including restrictions on incurring additional debt  creating liens on our properties and paying dividends  have less success in obtaining new work if our sureties or our lenders were to limit our ability to provide new performance bonds or letters of credit for our projects  be required to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to the repayment of debt and the interest associated with that debt  fail to comply with the terms of our credit facility  incur increased lending fees  costs and interest rates  and experience difficulty in financing future acquisitions and or continuing operations 
all or any of these matters could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors with more liquidity and could have a negative impact upon our financial condition and results of operations 
foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects or to obtain projects 
we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in us dollars  however  from time to time we enter into contracts denominated in a foreign currency 
this practice subjects us to foreign exchange risks  particularly to the extent contract revenues are denominated in a currency different than the contract costs 
we attempt to minimize our exposure from foreign exchange risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies  matching the contract revenue currency with the contract costs currency or entering into hedge contracts when there 
table of contents are different currencies for contract revenues and costs 
however  these actions will not always eliminate all foreign exchange risks 
foreign exchange controls may also adversely affect us 
for instance  foreign exchange controls were instituted in venezuela on february  these controls may limit our ability to repatriate profits from our venezuelan subsidiaries or otherwise convert local currency into us dollars 
these limitations could adversely affect us 
further  our ability to obtain international contracts is impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar to foreign currencies 
we may incur unexpected liabilities associated with the stone webster and it group acquisitions  as well as other acquisitions 
in july  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of stone webster  inc  and during fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities of the it group  inc we believe  pursuant to the terms of the agreements for the stone webster and it group asset acquisitions  that we assumed only certain liabilities  which we refer to as assumed liabilities  specified in those agreements 
in addition  those agreements provide that certain other liabilities  including but not limited to  certain outstanding borrowings  certain leases  certain contracts in process  completed contracts  claims or litigation that relate to acts or events occurring prior to the acquisition date  and certain employee benefit obligations are specifically excluded from our transactions 
we refer to these as excluded liabilities 
there can be no assurance  however  that we do not have any exposure related to the excluded liabilities 
in addition  some of the former owners of companies that we have acquired are contractually required to indemnify us against liabilities related to the operation of their companies before we acquired them and for misrepresentations made by them in connection with the acquisitions 
in some cases  these former owners may not have the financial ability to meet their indemnification responsibilities 
if this occurs  we may incur unexpected liabilities 
any of these unexpected liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
if we must write off a significant amount of intangible assets or long lived assets  our earnings will be negatively impacted 
because we have grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of august  if we make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets on our books 
we also have long lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets of million as of august  which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if a determination that a significant impairment in value of our unamortized intangible assets or long lived assets occurs  such determination would require us to write off a substantial portion of our assets 
such a write off would negatively affect our earnings 
difficulties integrating our acquisitions could adversely affect us 
from time to time  we have made acquisitions to pursue market opportunities  increase our existing capabilities and expand into new areas of operation 
we plan to pursue select acquisitions in the future 
if we are unable to identify acquisition opportunities or complete acquisitions we have identified  our business could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may encounter difficulties integrating our future acquisitions and in successfully managing the growth we expect from the acquisitions 
in addition  our expansion into new businesses  such as with our it group acquisition  may expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have traditionally experienced 
to the extent we encounter problems in identifying acquisition risks or integrating our acquisitions  we could be materially adversely affected 
because we may pursue acquisitions around the world and may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously  we may encounter unforeseen expenses  complications and delays  including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 
our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  including key officers  could have an adverse effect on us 

table of contents our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers  scientists and other professional personnel in accordance with our needs  either through direct hiring or acquisition of other firms employing such professionals  will be an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to attract and retain needed professionals 
in addition  our ability to be successful depends in part on our ability to attract and retain skilled laborers and craftsmen in our pipe fabrication and construction businesses 
demand for these workers can at times be high and the supply extremely limited 
our success is also highly dependent upon the continued services of our key officers 
the loss of any of our key officers could adversely affect us 
we do not maintain key employee insurance on any of our executive officers 
changes in technology could adversely affect us  and our competitors may develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology 
we believe that we have a leading position in technologies for the design and construction of ethylene processing plants 
we protect our position through patent registrations  license restrictions and a research and development program 
however  it is possible that others may develop competing processes that could negatively affect our market position 
additionally  we have developed construction and power generation and transmission software which we believe provide competitive advantages 
the advantages currently provided by this software could be at risk if competitors were to develop superior or comparable technologies 
our induction pipe bending technology and capabilities favorably influence our ability to compete successfully 
currently this technology and our proprietary software are not patented 
even though we have some legal protections against the dissemination of this know how  including non disclosure and confidentiality agreements  our efforts to prevent others from using our technology could be time consuming  expensive and ultimately may be unsuccessful or only partially successful 
finally  there is nothing to prevent our competitors from independently attempting to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technology

table of contents we may experience adverse impacts on our results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations 
our implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules  including new accounting rules and interpretations  could adversely affect our operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results in future periods 
for example  effective august   we are required by the sarbanes oxley act of to begin filing an annual report on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
although we believe our internal controls are operating effectively  and we have committed internal resources and engaged external consultants to ensure compliance  we cannot guarantee that we will not have any material weaknesses as reported by our external auditors and such determination could materially adversely affect our business 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and by laws and rights agreement could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
our articles of incorporation and by laws contain certain provisions  such as a provision establishing a classified board of directors in the event the entire board of directors is increased to twelve or more members  provisions entitling holders of shares of common stock that have been beneficially owned for four years or more to five votes per share  a provision prohibiting shareholders from calling special meetings  a provision requiring super majority voting of the outstanding voting power to approve certain business combinations and provisions authorizing the board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock without approval of our shareholders 
also  we have adopted a rights plan that limits the ability of any person to acquire more than of our common stock 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or the removal of management  of deterring potential acquirers from making an offer to our shareholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for the common stock 
provisions of our shareholder rights agreement could also have the effect of deterring changes of control 
terrorists actions have and could continue to negatively impact the us economy and the markets in which we operate 
terrorist attacks  like those that occurred on september   have contributed to economic instability in the united states  and further acts of terrorism  violence or war could affect the markets in which we operate  our business and our expectations 
there can be no assurance that armed hostilities will not increase or that terrorist attacks  or responses from the united states  will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability in the united states 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers and could impact our domestic or international revenues  our supply chain  our production capability and our ability to deliver our products and services to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business

foreign currency risks the majority of our transactions are in us dollars  however  certain of our subsidiaries conduct their operations in various foreign currencies 
currently  when considered appropriate  we use hedging instruments to manage our risks associated with our operating activities when an operation enters into a transaction in a currency that is different from its local currency 
in these circumstances  we will frequently utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge the anticipated purchases and or revenues 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching our revenues and expenses in the same currency for our contracts 
as of august   we had minimal forward exchange contracts outstanding that were hedges of certain commitments of foreign subsidiaries 
the exposure from the commitments is not material to our results of operations or financial position see notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements
