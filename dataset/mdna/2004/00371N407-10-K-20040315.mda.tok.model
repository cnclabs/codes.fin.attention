item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  make and sell generic drugs 
in  we acquired able laboratories  inc  our generic drug development and manufacturing business 
in and  respectively  we acquired superior pharmaceutical company and generic distributors  inc  our former distribution operations 
our distribution businesses sold mostly our competitors products 
after careful analysis  we decided to divest our distribution operations and continue only as a generic drug development and manufacturing company selling only our own products 
we sold the assets of generic distributors  inc on december  and we sold superior pharmaceutical company on february  on may   we merged our subsidiary  able laboratories  inc  into our parent company  dynagen  inc  and changed dynagen s name to able laboratories  inc in november  we acquired substantially all the assets of liquisource  inc  a privately held developer and manufacturer of prescription liquid pharmaceuticals 
in  we expect to continue to increase our sales of generic drug products by attempting to increase sales of our existing products and by obtaining anda approvals from the fda for new products 
also  we intend to develop our liquids formulation ability and position ourselves to add liquids products to our product line  through our utilization of the assets we acquired from liquisource 
see certain factors that may affect future results our ability to develop liquid formulations is unproven 
to accomplish these objectives  we entered into a long term lease for our new facility in cranbury  new jersey  which we intend to use for our solid and semi solid dosage manufacturing operations and our executive offices 
also  we purchased the building and leasehold improvements at our facility located at hollywood court  south plainfield  new jersey  where we currently house all of our manufacturing operation and which we intend to use in the future for our liquids manufacturing business 
we expect to spend approximately  in to fund these growth initiatives 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
in the section of this report entitled certain factors that may affect future results  we have described several risk factors which we believe are significant 
we consider each of these risks specific to us  although some are industry or sector related issues which could also impact  to some degree  other businesses in our market sector 
you should give very careful consideration to these risks when you evaluate us 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
as a result  these policies are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying these policies  our management makes estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources  and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about our reported operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies include inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of average cost or market  with cost being determined based upon the first in first out method 
in evaluating whether inventory is to be stated at cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell existing inventory and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves  when necessary  for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience and management s assessment of current product demand 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
if we were to determine that our inventory was overvalued based upon the above factors  then we would have to increase our reserves 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue on product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is reasonable assurance that we will collect the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
thus  we principally recognize revenue upon shipment and  in certain cases  recognize revenue when customers receive shipments 
allowances for returns and price adjustments 
our product revenues are typically subject to agreements with customers allowing chargebacks  rebates  rights of return  pricing adjustments and other allowances 
based on our agreements and contracts with our customers  we calculate allowances for these items when we recognize revenue and we book the allowances as reserves against accounts receivable 
chargebacks  primarily from wholesalers  are the most significant of these items 
chargebacks result from arrangements we have with customers establishing prices for products for which the customers independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase 
a chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler  which is typically stated at wholesale acquisition cost  and the end customer s contract price  which is lower 
we credit the wholesaler for purchases by end customers at the lower price 
therefore  we record these chargebacks at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers 
we base these reserves primarily on our contractual arrangements and  to a lesser extent  historical chargeback experience 
the majority of our sales are made to wholesalers 
for  mckesson corporation  a wholesaler  accounted for approximately of our sales 
we continually monitor the wholesaler inventory levels and the corresponding reserve estimates and compensate for contractual changes  giving consideration to our observations of current pricing trends and we make adjustments to our provisions for chargebacks and similar items when we believe that the actual credits will differ from our original provisions 
to date  actual amounts have not differed materially from our estimates 
consistent with industry practice  we maintain a policy that allows our customers to return product 
our estimate of the provision for returns is based upon our historical experience with actual returns 
price adjustments  also referred to as shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products which our customer has remaining in its inventory at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in our selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated launch dates of competing products  estimated declines in market price and estimates of inventory held by the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have historically provided financial terms to customers in accordance with what management views as industry norms 
financial terms  for credit approved customers  are generally on a net day basis  though most customers are entitled to a prompt payment discount 
management periodically and regularly reviews customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  considering factors such as economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or if they were otherwise unable to make payments in accordance with management s expectations  we might have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the currently enacted income tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
a deferred tax asset is also recorded for net operating loss  capital loss and tax credit carryforwards to the extent their realization is more likely than not 
generally  the deferred tax benefit or expense for the period represents the change in the deferred tax asset or liability from the beginning to the end of the period 
as of december   we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  management determined that it was more likely than not that these benefits will be realized in future periods prior to expiration of the carryforward period 
therefore  we recognized the related deferred tax asset for this and other temporary differences  which resulted in a net income tax benefit that increased net income by  or per diluted share  for because we recognized this tax benefit during the fourth quarter of  we intend  in future profitable periods  to report net income as if we were fully taxed 
we do not  however  expect to pay federal income taxes  other than the alternative minimum tax  until we fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
if  in future periods  we determine that we are not likely to realize the tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards  then we would increase our reserve against the asset  the amount of which would be deducted from income during the period in which we increase the reserve 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in sales of  or  is primarily due to a greater number of products available for sale as well as higher demand for our products 
from june  to december   we have received fda approval for new product families in different product strengths 
during the year ended december   we had fda approved product families in different strengths available for sale  compared to fda approved product families in different strengths available for sale during the year ended december  cost of sales 
cost of sales was  or of sales  for the year ended december   compared to  or of sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in the gross profit margin to from is primarily attributable to sub optimal utilization of the company s manufacturing capacity in the first quarter of a part of our capacity expansion  the company s hollywood court manufacturing facility underwent substantial reconfiguration resulting in downtime and unabsorbed labor costs and other overhead in the first quarter of all current manufacturing upgrades  relocations and additional equipment installations to this location are now complete  allowing the company to resume normal manufacturing operations 
however  the company continues to face labor inefficiencies due to capacity constraints within the hollywood court manufacturing facility 
these inefficiencies also contributed to the decrease in gross profit margin 
finally  the product mix also contributed to the decline in gross profit margins 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  our expenses increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits  sales commissions  advertising and trade show expenses  and professional fees of approximately    and  respectively 
as of december   we had full time employees in selling  general and administrative positions compared to full time employees in similar positions at december  we expect to add additional employees in the future to support our anticipated sales growth 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  a significant portion of these expenses relate to research which is currently being conducted to develop generic drugs 
the increase of  is primarily due to an increase in laboratory supplies  milestone payments to raw material suppliers working in conjunction with us to develop new products and biostudies conducted by independent contract research organizations of approximately   and  respectively 
the balance of approximately  is due to increased activity in supporting a higher number of research projects 
these support activities include quality assurance  stability testing and regulatory support 
at this time approximately quality and regulatory employees are providing the support function for the primary research and development activity 
as of december   we had new products pending approval with the fda and expect to increase our research and development activities for a broad range of products over the next several months 
operating income 
our operating income for the year ended december  increased by  to  compared to our operating income of  for the year ended december  the increase in operating income resulted from increased net sales and gross margins  which exceeded the greater operating expenses incurred to support our continued growth 
other income expense 
interest and financing expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  other expenses also includes a  loss on early retirement of debt 
miscellaneous income of  for the year ended december  primarily consists of interest income from cash deposits resulting from the sale of common stock and the rxbazaar note receivable partially offset by miscellaneous expenses 
income taxes 
as of december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  management determined that it was more likely than not that these benefits will be realized in future periods prior to expiration of the carryforward period 
therefore  we recognized the related deferred tax asset for this and other temporary differences  which resulted in a net income tax benefit that increased net income by  or per diluted share  for income tax expense for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share and our effective tax rate was 
because of our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards  our income tax expense is primarily a non cash expense 
we do not expect to pay federal income taxes  other than the alternative minimum tax  until we fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
net income 
we recorded net income of  for the year ended december   compared to net income of  for the year ended december  we recorded net income applicable to common stockholders of  or per basic share  for the year ended december   compared to net income applicable to common stock of  or per basic share  for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   compared to diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
sales for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the sales for included  in net sales of our distribution subsidiary  superior pharmaceutical  which we sold in february and which added no revenue in this  decrease was offset by a significant increase in sales of our recently approved generic drugs  resulting in an increase in sales of  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  cost of sales 
cost of sales was  or of sales  for the year ended december   compared to  or of sales  for the year ended december  the increase in the gross profit margin to from is due to manufacturing efficiencies and economies of scale  which were partially offset by a  product recall charge to cost of sales 
our gross profit margin for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of was   and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  expenses declined by  as a result of the february sale of superior  however  the savings were offset by increased selling  general and administrative costs at our manufacturing facility 
excluding costs related to superior  our expenses increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to certain non cash expenses  additional depreciation and amortization expense and an increase in sales and administrative personnel to support our growth 
as of december   we had full time employees in selling  general and administrative positions compared to full time employees in similar positions at december  research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in expenses relates to an increased rate of filings with the fda for new product approvals 
costs of biostudies and outside assays  conducted by independent contract research organizations  for the year ended december  were approximately  and  compared to  and  for the year ended december   respectively 
costs of research and development supplies  equipment  and raw materials increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  as of december   we had new products pending approval with the fda 
operating income 
our operating income for the year ended december  increased by  to  compared to our operating loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in operating income resulted from increased net sales and gross margins  which exceeded the greater operating expenses incurred to support our continued growth 
other income expense 
interest and financing expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  our interest and financing expenses decreased by  as our senior secured debt was paid off and our senior subordinated debt was eliminated as a result of the february  sale of superior 
in addition  we paid off several other debt obligations during the year ended december  partially offsetting these savings was additional interest incurred on our june borrowing of  and our october equipment credit facility of  other expenses also includes a  increase to the rxbazaar note receivable reserve 
income taxes 
as of december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of  management determined that it was more likely than not that these benefits would be realized in future periods prior to expiration of the carryforward period 
therefore  we recognized the related deferred tax asset for this and other temporary differences  which resulted in a net income tax benefit that increased net income by  or per diluted share  for because we recognized these tax benefits during the fourth quarter of  in future profitable periods  we expect to report our net income as if we were fully taxed 
we do not  however  expect to pay federal income taxes  other than possibly the alternative minimum tax  until we fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
net income 
we recorded net income of  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  we recorded net income applicable to common stockholders of  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss applicable to common stock of  or per share  for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   compared to a diluted loss per share of for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of  compared to working capital of  at december  cash was  as of december   compared to  at december  the  increase in our working capital is primarily due to our net income of  for the year ended december  and net proceeds of  from our sale of common stock primarily offset by our additional investment of  in property  plant and equipment 
we expect to make additional investments of approximately  in property and equipment in most of the expected  in additional investments in will be made on our newly leased cranbury manufacturing facility 
our new facility should allow us to expand our current manufacturing capabilities and alleviate certain current manufacturing constraints 
in addition  the new facility should allow us to consolidate a portion of our existing operations upon expiration of current lease obligations  which should allow us to reduce manufacturing expenses in future periods 
accounts receivable was  and inventory was  at december  the accounts receivable allowance at december  includes allowances for customer chargebacks  rebates  returns  other pricing adjustments and doubtful accounts 
our allowance consists primarily of allowances stipulated by contracts with major drug wholesalers that are customary in the generic drug industry 
we establish these allowances as we recognize the sales and monitor these allowances on an ongoing basis 
to date  actual amounts have not differed materially from our estimates 
management expects accounts receivable and inventory will continue to increase over the near term as sales continue to increase 
our stated working capital  accounts receivable and inventory depend on various estimates and judgments of management 
see critical accounting policies 
during the year ended december   we sold  shares of common stock for gross proceeds of  converted  of unsecured notes payable into common stock  and borrowed an additional  under our existing equipment loan and revolving credit facility 
during that time we paid off our equipment loan of  and paid down our revolving credit facility by  in addition to paying down certain other debt 
the remaining proceeds from the issuance of common stock will be used to support our planned manufacturing investments  as stated above  and the expansion of our research and development activities over the next several quarters 
during september  our bank issued a letter of credit for  as a security deposit under a new lease agreement for the aforementioned cranbury facility 
subsequent to year end  we entered into a new million revolving credit agreement with our existing lender 
this new revolver replaces the existing revolving credit facility of million and terminates the existing equipment loan 
the new revolver bears interest  at inception  at libor plus based upon our current leverage ratio 
in addition  the new revolver is expandable to million upon our request and the approval of the bank 
the revolver expires march we used this new revolver to repay the entire outstanding principal balance under the old revolver of million 
in addition  we transferred the existing outstanding letter of credit to the new revolver 
the amount available under our revolving credit agreement is reduced by the full amount of the letter of credit 
a summary of our contractual obligations at december  is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total after debt obligations      operating leases      total      in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the above chart  at december  we had several open purchase orders for raw materials  supplies  and ongoing construction activities 
we do not believe the open purchase orders were materially significant  either individually or in aggregate  and are a normal part of our daily operations 
we expect to fund our working capital needs from operations and from amounts available from borrowings under our secured working capital credit facility 
if we need additional working capital to fund future expansion  we will seek an increase in our line of credit or other debt financing before selling additional equity securities  although there is no guarantee that we will be able to secure such financing 
environmental liability we have no known material environmental violations or assessments 
recent accounting pronouncement in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
other recent accounting pronouncements include fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
neither of these accounting pronouncements had an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
certain factors that may affect future results we may have difficulty managing our growth 
we have been experiencing a period of rapid growth that has been placing a strain on our resources 
revenue from our operations for the year ended december  increased by to  the number of our employees increased from in march to as of february  we anticipate that our revenues and business activities will continue to grow in to manage future growth effectively  we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and our manufacturing processes and compliance programs  as well as the operational and administrative tasks associated with integrating new personnel and managing expanding operations 
the challenges inherent in managing growth are significant 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  we could experience a material adverse effect on the quality of our products  our ability to retain key personnel  our operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel or continue to attract additional qualified professionals we may be unable to carry out our plans to maintain or expand our business 
our future success depends  to a significant degree  on the skill  experience and efforts of our chief executive officer and the other members of our senior management team 
the loss of any member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business 
also  because of the nature of our business  our ability to develop new generic drug products and to compete with our current and future competitors depends to a large extent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific  technical and professional personnel 
the loss of key scientific  technical or professional personnel or our failure to recruit additional key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business 
we face intense competition from other manufacturers of generic drugs 
in order to succeed in the generic drug business  we need to achieve a significant share of the market for each generic drug we market 
the generic drug manufacturing and distribution business is highly competitive 
we compete with several companies that are better capitalized than we are and that have financial and human resources significantly greater than ours 
because we manufacture generic drugs  our products  by their very nature  are chemically and biologically equivalent to the products of our larger and profitable competitors 
also  we believe that  as a rule  the first one or two companies to bring a generic alternative to the market will capture the highest market share for that product 
we intend to compete by  among other things  being the first to market certain new generic drug products 
these larger companies  with their greater resources  could bring products to market before us and could capture a significant share of the market at our expense  preventing us from executing this business strategy 
recently several foreign companies  primarily from europe and india  have entered the us generic market either by establishing manufacturing subsidiaries or by forming marketing alliances with us generic companies 
foreign companies  especially those from india  enjoy lower manufacturing costs  labor costs and tax rates 
they may also leverage these advantages over us manufacturers through backward integration  by combining the research and development talent necessary to develop active drug ingredients with the ability efficiently to make the finished dosage products 
the result is increased competition and downward pressure on prices 
in certain cases  foreign companies prices could become so low that competing us companies could not profitably manufacture certain drugs and therefore be forced to discontinue the products 
almost all these companies also operate in less stringent patent and intellectual property protection environments and lead us companies in r d timings 
these factors are present in the us generic drug industry today and are likely to have continued increasing influence  resulting in intensified competition  lower prices and lower margins industry wide over the next several years 
we may seek opportunities to form an alliance with one or more foreign companies 
whether we would succeed in forming such an agreement  and the exact nature of any such arrangement  is unknown 
our revenues and gross profit from individual generic drug products are likely to decline as competing firms introduce their own generic equivalents 
revenues and gross profit derived from generic drug products tend to follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that we believe to be unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
as patents or other exclusivity periods for brand name products expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for a generic equivalent of the product often is able to capture a substantial share of the market 
however  as other generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals for the product  the first manufacturer s market share and the price of the product will typically decline 
therefore  our revenues and gross profits from individual generic pharmaceutical products are likely to decline over time as a result of increased competition 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to develop new generic drug products that we believe will be necessary to achieve sufficient gross profit margins 
in some circumstances  we may retroactively reduce the price of products that we have already sold to customers but that have not been resold by such customers 
in some circumstances  we may issue to our customers credits for products that we previously sold to them but that have not been resold by them 
these credits effectively constitute a retroactive reduction of the price of products already sold 
we estimate and record reserves with respect to these potential credits based on historical experience  our observations of buying patterns and current pricing trends 
actual credits claimed by our customers could differ significantly from those estimates 
our ability to develop liquid formulations is unproven 
in november  we acquired the assets of liquisource  inc  a developer of liquid pharmaceutical products 
we intend to use the liquisource assets to leverage our ongoing research and development efforts 
we will seek opportunities to develop liquid formulations for solid and semi solid dosage products that we currently manufacture 
however  we have not previously developed or sold liquid formulations and we expect that it will be some time before we can bring any new liquid products to market 
we can give no assurance that we will successfully integrate the liquisource business into our ongoing operations or that we will develop the ability to manufacture and sell liquid products on a profitable basis 
we are obligated to issue a large number of shares of common stock at prices lower than market value 
we are obligated to issue a large number of shares of common stock at prices below market value 
therefore  our common stock could lose value if a large number of these shares are issued into the market 
as of february    shares of common stock were issued and outstanding 
we have issued options  warrants and preferred stock  that are exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock 
as of february   we were obligated to issue up to  additional shares of common stock upon the conversion of our series q convertible preferred stock 
we have also reserved  shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to options and warrants granted to our employees  officers  directors  consultants and investors 
the holders of these convertible securities likely would only exercise their rights to acquire common stock at times when the exercise price is lower than the price at which they could buy the common stock on the open market 
because we would likely receive less than current market price for any shares of common stock issued upon exercise of options and warrants  the exercise of a large number of these convertible securities could reduce the per share market price of common stock held by existing investors 
conversion of outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock or the exercise of other derivative securities may reduce the market price of our outstanding common stock 
the conversion of outstanding shares of our series q preferred stock or the exercise of other derivative securities could depress the price of our common stock 
specifically  public resales of shares of our common stock following exercises or conversions of preferred stock or other derivative securities may depress the prevailing market price of our common stock 
even prior to the time of actual conversions of the preferred stock or exercises of derivative securities  the perception of a significant market overhang resulting from the existence of our obligation to honor such conversions and exercises could depress the market price of our common stock 
the value of our common stock has fluctuated widely and investors could lose money on their investments in our stock 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and it is likely that it will continue to do so in the future 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially based upon a variety of factors including o quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  o announcements of new products by us or our competitors  o key personnel losses  o sales of common stock  o developments or announcements with respect to industry standards  regulatory matters  patents or proprietary rights  and o general economic and political conditions 
during  the market price of our common stock fluctuated between approximately and approximately  and was approximately on february  these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market value of our common stock in that  at the current price  any fluctuation in the dollar price per share could constitute a significant percentage decrease in the value of a stockholder s investment 
we may face product liability for which we may not be adequately insured 
the testing  marketing and sale of drug products for human use is inherently risky 
liability might result from claims made directly by consumers or by pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products 
we presently carry product liability insurance in amounts that we believe to be adequate  but we can give no assurance that such insurance will remain available at a reasonable cost or that any insurance policy would offer coverage sufficient to meet any liability arising as a result of a claim 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance on reasonable terms or that  if obtained  such insurance will be sufficient to protect us against such potential liability or at a reasonable cost 
the obligation to pay any product liability claim or a recall of a product could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and future prospects 
intense regulation by government agencies may delay our efforts to commercialize our proposed drug products 
our products and business activities are highly regulated  principally by the fda  the us drug enforcement agency  state governments and governmental agencies of other countries 
federal and state regulations and statutes impose certain requirements on the testing  manufacturing  labeling  storage  recordkeeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products 
also  some of our products contain narcotic ingredients 
regulations pertaining to the sale of such drugs may prove difficult or expensive to comply with  and we and other pharmaceutical companies may face lawsuits 
if we are alleged to be out of compliance with applicable requirements  then we would face judicial and administrative sanctions  including seizures of adulterated or misbranded products  injunction actions  fines and criminal prosecutions 
any of these events could disrupt our business and our ability to supply products to our customers 
we depend on third parties to supply the raw materials used in our products  any failure to obtain a sufficient supply of raw materials from these suppliers could materially and adversely affect our business 
before we can market any generic drug  we must first obtain fda approval of our proposed drug and  also  of the active drug raw materials that we use 
we rely on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products 
all of our third party suppliers and contractors are subject to fda and other regulatory oversight 
in many instances  our fda approvals cover only one source of raw materials 
if raw materials from that approved supplier were to become unavailable  we would be required to file a supplement to our abbreviated new drug application to use a different manufacturer and revalidate the manufacturing process using a new supplier s materials 
this could cause a delay of several months in the manufacture of the drug involved and the consequent loss of potential revenue and market share 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use any derivative financial instruments 
all of our direct sales are in the united states and denominated in us dollars 
our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our debt instruments 
our debt instruments  at december   are subject to variable interest rates  which float based upon a spread over libor or us bank prime rate  and fixed interest rates and principal payments 
management does not believe that any risk inherent in these instruments is likely to have a material effect on our financial statements
