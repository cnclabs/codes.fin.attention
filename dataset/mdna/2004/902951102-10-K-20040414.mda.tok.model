item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations results of operations during the year the pending sale of use canada to the countryside fund and the accounting for sefl under the equity method affected the revenues and expenses reported for financial statement purposes 
these revenues and expenses are lower than reported in previous years 
in addition  the sale of geothermal  llc also reduced revenues 
geothermal  llc and use canada are reported as discontinued operations

these contracts have fixed rates which include preventative maintenance 
the number of full time employees in useb was reduced by approximately percent due to these contracts and other cost saving efforts 
operating expenses also declined as a percent of total revenues 
the year operating expenses were of total revenues compared with in the year general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal year compared with  for fiscal year  a decrease of  or 
the large decrease was due principally to the non recurring items that were included in the fiscal year results 
the non recurring items relate to the recognition of million of previously deferred compensation  the payment of million of severance fees and consulting fees related to the consolidation of the accounting and administrative functions of useb  the recognition of development costs amounting to  and the increase in the doubtful accounts balance of million

during  we incurred substantial non recurring costs or expenses in restructuring and improving certain projects  eliminating unnecessary or redundant administrative functions  risk mitigation and the termination and or disposition of non performing or non strategic assets 
revenues the company s fiscal revenues were  an increase of when compared with the fiscal year end revenues of the operations group increased primarily due to the consolidation of two significant acquisitions  including useb  and for the full fiscal year and sefl for nine months of fiscal  respectively 
revenue increases were offset by the elimination of revenues from the sale of us enviro and non recurring items from useb 
in  biogas revenues were essentially flat when compared to the prior year period 
expenses operating expenses the operating expenses of the company grew  or from this increase  while mostly due to the recognition of a full year of operating expenses for useb and nine months of operating expenses for sefl  is also due to significant non recurring of expenses in for useb and costs associated with discontinued operations of non strategic assets 
additionally  approximately million of site improvements were recognized as period expenses in operating expenses were of total revenues in compared with of total revenues in accounting for combined accruals for the payment of royalties and royalty termination payments  the company recorded a million non cash charge and valuation expense geothermal  llc

these expenses were recognized due to expected losses in the sale of the us enviro  write down of development costs of  discontinued operations in useb  valuation adjustments of investments held by lehi and geothermal  llc  and potential severance and other expenses related to the consolidation of operations and accounting of useb 
general and administrative salaries and consulting fees increased by more than million due in part to the recognition of million of deferred compensation from in  these expenses were deferred and were to be amortized over five years 
additionally  useb incurred severance fees and consulting fees related to the consolidation of the accounting and administrative functions of million 
legal and professional fees increased primarily due to the retention of lawyers specializing in irs proceedings related to useb illinois subsidiary income recognition and the termination of contracts related to discontinued operations at useb 
the irs proceeding concluded without any material change to our tax position 
insurance expense increased due to the general increase in all insurance since september   including a major increase in the cost of director s and officer s liability insurance in  and the inclusion of biogas on a full year basis 
other general and administrative expenses increased from previous years due to the recognition of development costs of  the increase in the doubtful account balance of million by biogas and the inclusion of useb on a full year basis 
corporate expenses for  after excluding non recurring period charges  remained relatively constant 
gains from investments and joint ventures decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to lower power generation at the plymouth facility 
interest income and expense interest income increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal an increase of as a result of higher cash balances and the receipt of interest on notes receivable not in effect in the full prior period 
dividends paid on preferred stock decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as a result of the reduced dividend rates 
interest expense increased significantly due mainly to the consolidation of non recourse project financing in connection with useb and use canada on a full year basis 
income tax provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit for fiscal of  the effective tax rate was approximately for fiscal the company had an nol carry forward of million  some of which is subject to limitation under section of the irs code 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
dollars in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt obligations      operating lease obligations  rate incentive liability   total liquidity and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately  of which  was unrestricted 
in connection with certain notes payable for certain useb subsidiaries  the lender requires these subsidiaries to maintain various restricted cash accounts  which at december  amounted to  this amount also includes approximately  which the company set aside to ensure payment of dividends on certain series of preferred stock present in the terms thereof 
during the year ended december  net cash flows from operating and financing activities were used to fund cash flows from investing and financing activities 
during the year  cash flow from operating activities amounted to  and increased from the year level of  cash flow from investing activities were  at december  compared with  at december  the large decrease is due to the accounting change for the sefl investment reflecting the equity method of accounting 
cash flows from financing activities amounted to a decrease of  at december  compared with an increase of  at december  the year includes  of proceeds for long term debt applicable to the sefl project 
our consolidated working capital including  of restricted cash at december  increased to  at december  from  at december  due primarily to increased restricted cash and a reduction in short term debt 
at december   cash and equivalents totaled approximately  of which  was unrestricted  as compared with  of unrestricted cash at december  in connection with notes payable by certain biogas subsidiaries  the lender required these subsidiaries to maintain various restricted cash accounts  which  at december   amounted to  this amount also includes approximately  million of funds the company set aside to ensure the payment of dividends on certain series of our preferred stock pursuant to the terms thereof 
during the year ended december   cash flow of  from financing activities and  of operating funds were used to fund  of investing activities 
cash flow from operating activities during the year ended december  decreased  after accounting for the effect of the non recurring non cash effecting charges recorded by the company as compared with  during the year ended december  the company used its unrestricted cash during to launch sefl  reduce overall headcount of employees and fund daily operations 
we used  in acquiring additional assets and investments 
construction in progress used  in cash in the current twelve months period 
our consolidated working capital including  of restricted cash at december  decreased to  at december  from  at december  reflecting lower cash balances 
we continue to evaluate current and forecasted cash flow as a basis to determine financing operating requirements and capital expenditures 
we believe that we have sufficient cash flow from operations and working capital including unrestricted cash on hand to satisfy all obligations under outstanding indebtedness  to finance anticipated capital expenditures and to fund working capital requirements during the next twelve months 
certain risk factors that may impact us set forth below and elsewhere in this report and other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to the company we may face substantial impediments to completing future acquisitions and development projects 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to identify and acquire appropriate companies or energy projects  our ability to develop new energy projects  our ability to integrate the acquired and developed operations effectively and our ability to increase our market share 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify viable acquisition candidates or development projects  that any identified candidates or development projects will be acquired or developed  that acquired companies or power facilities and developed projects will be effectively integrated to realize expected efficiencies and economies of scale  or that any acquisitions or development projects will prove to be profitable or be without unforeseen liabilities 
in the event that acquisition candidates or development projects are not identifiable or acquisitions or development projects are prohibitively costly  we may be forced to alter our future growth strategy 
as we continue to pursue our acquisition and development strategy in the future  our stock price  financial condition and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
we have limited available capital  and we may need additional financing in the future 
we believe that our current and anticipated cash flow from operations and assets sales from the financing sources and transactions described herein will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months  however  there can be no assurance in this regard 
as of december  we had approximately million unrestricted cash available 
as a closing of the countryside fund we have in excess of million unrestricted cash available 
if we are unable to generate cash flows from operations to fund our working capital needs  we would be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing to continue to operate our business 
in addition  we anticipate that each project we acquire or develop will require us to raise additional financing  some of which may be in the form of additional equity 
there can be no assurance that this capital will be available to us  or if available  that it will be on terms acceptable to us 
if issuing equity securities raises additional funds  significant dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if additional financing for projects is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to cancel  decline or defer new projects 
any inability by us to obtain additional financing to meet cash or capital requirements  if required  may have a material adverse effect on our operations 
our subsidiaries have substantial indebtedness and in connection with their existing indebtedness we have agreed to significant restrictions upon their operations  including their ability to use their cash 
we have substantial debt that has been incurred to finance the acquisition and development of energy facilities 
as of december   our total consolidated long term debt was million  our total consolidated assets were about million and our stockholders equity was approximately million 
whether we will be able to meet our debt service obligations and repay our outstanding indebtedness will depend primarily upon the performance of our energy projects 
our subsidiaries existing debt agreements limit or prohibit their ability to engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business and may limit their ability to pay dividends to us 
although we have insurance it may not cover every potential risk associated with our operations 
although we maintain insurance of various types to cover many of the risks that apply to our operations  including million of general liability insurance  a million umbrella policy  as well as separate insurance for each project  our insurance will not cover every potential risk associated with our operations 
the occurrence of a significant adverse event  the risks of which are not fully covered by insurance  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
we have issued many securities convertible into shares of our common stock and we have many authorized but unissued shares of our common stock 
we have issued shares of our preferred stock  options  warrants  and other securities convertible into shares of our common stock 
in addition a substantial portion of shares issued in connection with the zapco merger are subject to sales restrictions that have lapsed effective may  the market price of our common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these securities sell the underlying shares of common stock or the restricted shares issued to the zapco stockholders or if the market perceives that they are intending to sell them 
certain of these zapco stockholders have sold some of their shares or have stated their intention to do so 
the possibility that substantial amounts of our common stock may be issued or freely resold in the public market may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock  even if our business is doing well 
risks related to our energy business we depend on our electricity and thermal energy customers 
our energy facilities rely on one or more energy sales agreements with one or more customers for a substantial portion of their revenues 
any material failure by any customer to fulfill it obligations under an energy sales agreement could have a negative effect on the cash flow available to us and on our results of operations 
the energy business is very competitive and increased competition could adversely affect us 
in addition to competition from electric utilities in the markets where our projects are located  our energy business also faces competition from companies currently involved in the cogeneration and independent power market throughout the united states 
some of these companies are larger and better financed than we are 
although we believe that we will be entering segments of the marketplace where we will not face extensive competition  no assurances can be made that we will be able to enter these markets or that there will not be competition in such markets 
additionally  in recent years  such competition has contributed to a reduction in electricity prices in certain markets 
while a majority of the off takers of our projects is contractually obligated to purchase electricity under long term power ppa s  the projects based on market pricing will be exposed to fluctuations in the wholesale price of electricity 
in addition  should any of the long term contracts terminate or expire  we will be required to either negotiate new ppas or sell into the electricity wholesale market for electricity  in which case the prices for electricity will depend on market conditions at the time 
similarly  when the biogas projects located in illinois are no longer eligible to receive incentives under the rate incentive program  it is expected that the projects will seek to negotiate new contracts in the green power market based on rates prevailing in the green power market at the time 
further  the gross contract rate which useb s illinois based biogas projects receive is equal to the average amount per kwh paid by the local government entities in the project s respective jurisdiction and  therefore  may be subject to change 
we operate in an emerging industry and have limited marketing capabilities 
although the energy markets in which we operate have been in existence for a number of years  they are still in the development stage 
as is typically the case in an emerging industry  levels of demand and market acceptance for products and services are highly uncertain 
further  we have limited financial  personnel and other resources to undertake extensive marketing activities 
we may experience project development risks 
our ability to develop new projects is dependent on a number of factors outside our control  including obtaining customer contracts  power agreements  governmental permits and approvals  fuel supply and transportation agreements  electrical transmission agreements  site agreements and construction contracts 
no assurances can be made that we will be successful in obtaining these agreements  permits  and appraisals 
project development involves significant environmental  engineering and construction risks 
our business of owning  operating power plants  and district energy systems involve considerable risk 
the operation of energy generation facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of power generation  heating and cooling  equipment  transmission lines  pipes or other equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
although the facilities in which we are or will be involved contain some redundancies and back up mechanisms  no assurances can be made that those redundancies or back up mechanisms would allow the affected facility to perform under applicable power purchase and energy sale agreements 
useb has entered into operation and maintenance agreements with ge jenbacher and run energy for eight and two of its projects  respectively 
as a result  useb is and will be dependent on these third party operators for the successful operation of these projects 
to the extent that these parties do not fulfill their obligations under these agreements  useb s operations at these projects could be adversely affected 
renewable energy projects such as geothermal  biogas and biomass projects are dependent upon energy and fuel supplies  which may experience significant changes 
our energy projects  particularly our district energy systems  experience changes in revenue and expenses due to seasonality 
we may lose our status as a qualifying facility 
under present federal law in the united states  we will not and will not be regulated as a holding company under puhca as long as a our direct and indirect ownership  or operation of  projects used for the generation  transmission or distribution of electric energy for sale is limited to interests in qfs  and b we do not hold a direct or indirect interest in any company which owns or operates facilities used for the distribution at retail other than distribution only in enclosed portable containers  or distribution to tenants or employees of the company operating such facilities for their own use and not for resale of natural or manufactured gas for heat  light or power 
under purpa  as implemented by the ferc  a vertically integrated regulated electric utility company must purchase electricity at its avoided cost from a qf 
the regulated electric company could refuse to purchase that electricity if qf status was lost and may be entitled to certain remedies for breach of an existing ppa 
if any of our projects were to lose its status as a qf  then it  or its parent or affiliate  may no longer fall outside the scope of  or otherwise be entitled to exemption from  puhca  the federal power act fpa and state laws and regulations 
this could subject the our projects to rate and other regulation as a public utility under the fpa and state law and could result in the company  and certain of its affiliates inadvertently becoming public utility holding companies by owning  controlling  or holding with power to vote  at least of the outstanding voting securities of  or otherwise controlling  an entity that would constitute a public utility company or a holding company for the purposes of puhca 
this could cause the remaining projects that are qfs to lose their status due to ownership restrictions on qfs under purpa and ferc s implementing regulations 
any of these consequences would result in substantial regulatory burdens  and possibly insurmountable impediments  to affected entities with regard to conducting business in the manner currently contemplated 
in addition  loss of qf status could trigger defaults under covenants to maintain qf status in various purchase and loan agreements and result in termination  penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under such agreements  plus interest 
accordingly  the ability of useb to meet its repayment obligations under its debt obligations to countryside fund is dependent upon the biogas projects maintaining qf status 
a facility may lose its qf status on a retroactive or a prospective basis 
while certain legislation to repeal and amend certain sections of purpa  which had been pending before the united states senate and the united states house of representatives  would have protected each existing contract of qfs from a repeal of the obligation of electric utilities to purchase from qfs under their existing ppas  there is no guarantee that any future legislation  as passed into law  would contain provisions to grandfather such ppas 
loss of qf status for any biogas project could lead to  among other things  a requirement that the biogas project refund payments previously made under the ppas  with interest 
under the fpa  ferc has exclusive rate making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electric energy and the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce 
these rates may be determined on either a cost of service basis or  if the applicable standards are met  using a market based approach 
if any biogas project were to lose its qf status  the rates set forth in the applicable ppa would have to be filed with ferc and would be subject to initial and potentially subsequent reviews by ferc under the fpa  which could result in reductions to such rates 
loss of qf status by any illinois based biogas project would cause it also to lose its qswef status 
a significant source of us biogas revenues are generated from special tax credits provided for the sale of landfill gas to third parties and these credits will expire 
useb benefits from section of the code 
section provides that owners of biogas facilities that collect and sell biogas as a fuel are permitted to reduce their annual federal income tax liability with a tax credit based upon the volume of the biogas sold to unrelated third parties 
historically useb has sold interests in the gascos producing these tax credits to financial investors and such sales have provided useb with additional revenue 
part of the purchase price is contingent on gas production 
if gas production were to fall  useb s revenues may decline 
useb has agreed to indemnify the financial investors that have purchased interests in the gascos for certain losses suffered by such investors in the event that the section tax credits are denied in certain circumstances 
the tax credit is available for biogas produced at projects that had existing gas collection facilities that were placed in service before july  the tax credits are available for qualifying projects until december   except that projects which were in operation prior to qualified for the tax credits only through therefore the universe of projects eligible for tax credits is limited 
from time to time  legislation has been proposed to renew section tax credits  but it is uncertain whether this legislation will be enacted  what its final form will be  and in particular whether such legislation would extend section tax credits for existing projects or make them available only for new projects 
the unavailability of these tax credits for future biogas projects may make such future projects less attractive for investment 
the expiration of these tax credits for existing projects may make some biogas projects financially unviable and reduce useb s revenues 
neither useb  any of the gascos  nor any gasco partner has received a ruling from the irs confirming that the biogas facilities of the gascos meet the requirements of section  that the sales of interests in the gascos by useb were structured in a way that would entitle the buyers to section credits  or that sales of methane from the gascos to the gencos or transcos generate section credits 
while a ruling is not required  as is the case with any section transaction in which a ruling is not obtained  the irs may challenge the availability of section credits to any of the gascos or to its partners 
we may be unable to acquire or renew the numerous permits and approvals required to operate power facilities and district energy systems 
the construction and operation of energy projects require numerous permits and approvals from governmental agencies  as well as compliance with environmental laws and other regulations 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and that each of our projects has the requisite approvals  our projects require compliance with a varied and complex body of laws and regulations that both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce 
there can be no assurance that new laws or amendments to existing laws which would have a materially adverse affect will not be adopted  nor can there be any assurance that we will be able to obtain all necessary permits and approvals for proposed projects or that completed facilities will comply with all applicable permit conditions  statutes and regulations 
in addition  regulatory compliance for the construction of new facilities is a costly and time consuming process which may necessitate substantial expenditures to obtain permits  and may create a significant risk of expensive delays or loss of value if a project is unable to function as planned due to changing requirements or local opposition 
environmental health and safety risks our projects are regulated by numerous and significant laws  including statutes  regulations  by laws  guidelines  policies  directives and other requirements governing or relating to  among other things air emissions  discharges into water  the storage  handling  use  transportation and distribution of dangerous goods and hazardous and residual materials  such as chemicals  the prevention of releases of contaminants  pollutants or hazardous materials into the environment  the presence  remediation and monitoring of contaminants  pollutants or hazardous materials in soil and water  including surface or groundwater  both on and off site  land use and zoning matters  and workers health and safety matters 
as such  the operation of the projects and systems carry an inherent risk of environmental  health and safety liabilities including potential civil actions  compliance or remediation orders  fines and other penalties  and may result in the projects and systems being involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
our projects have obtained environmental permits that are required for their operation 
although we believe that the operations of the facilities are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental laws  including permits required for the operation of the projects and systems and although there are environmental monitoring and reporting systems in place with respect to all the projects and systems  there is no guarantee that more stringent laws will not be imposed  that there will not be more stringent enforcement of applicable laws or that such systems may not fail  which may result in material expenditures 
failure by the projects and systems to comply with any environmental  health or safety requirements  or increases in the cost of such compliance  including as a result of unanticipated liabilities whether as a result of newly discovered issues or known issues that have not been quantified or expenditures for investigation  assessment  remediation or monitoring  could result in additional expense  capital expenditures  restrictions and delays in the projects and systems activities  the extent of which cannot be predicted and which may be material 
resource availability and constancy the biogas projects rely on the extraction of biogas from public and privately owned landfill sites 
the decomposition of waste causes the release of methane gas  carbon dioxide  and other gaseous material into the ground and atmosphere 
landfills typically can emit biogas for more than years 
landfills generally produce biogas in increasing volumes during their initial years of operation and for several years after they are closed 
then the biogas volume gradually declines over ensuing years 
therefore each project is likely to produce less revenue after the first years following the landfill closing  and may over time become unprofitable as the volume of biogas continues to decline 
thus in many cases it is not profitable to maintain projects more than a certain number of years following the closing of the related landfill 
the quantity of available biogas is determined by numerous factors including  without limitation  filling pattern of the landfill  the composition of the waste  compaction  moisture content  time and climatic conditions 
these factors are beyond the control of useb 
further  they constitute future events that cannot be predicted with certainty 
in the event that the amount of biogas produced by a landfill is less than expected  the methane component of the gas is less than expected or the duration of biogas emission is shorter than expected  the sale of biogas by useb  the production of electricity by useb and or the amount of revenue received by useb from the sale of section tax credits may be adversely affected in a material manner 
generally with respect to each biogas project i the gasco s right to extract biogas from the landfill is subject to a long term gas rights agreement with the landfill owner  ii the genco or transco s right to purchase biogas from the gasco is subject to a long term gas purchase agreement with the gasco  and iii the genco or transco s right to occupy the landfill is subject to a long term lease with the landfill owner 
in certain cases  based on the occurrence of certain events  including an event of default by the gasco  genco or transco the contract counterparty may terminate the applicable agreement or lease prior to the expiry of its term 
while useb believes that the biogas projects  gascos  gencos and transco s are in material compliance with all of their respective agreements or leases  if one of the foregoing agreements or leases was terminated prematurely  for any reason  the relevant biogas project would be affected in a material adverse manner 
qswef status all of useb s illinois based biogas projects qualify as qswefs and therefore benefit from the rate incentive program 
the rate incentive program permits such qswefs to sell electricity that they generate to public utilities in whose service areas the qswefs are located at a rate that during the period of the rate incentive program a is equal to the average amount per kwh paid by the local governmental entities for electricity with certain exceptions in such qswefs respective jurisdictions and b typically exceeds the public utilities respective avoided costs 
eligibility for the rate incentive program is based on compliance with the requirements contained in the illinois public utility act  regulations promulgated by the icc icc regulations and the icc orders issued by the icc respecting qswefs 
a qswef would lose all or some of the benefits provided by the rate incentive program if it were found to be in non compliance with these requirements 
similarly  a qswef may lose all or some of such benefits in the event of modifications to the illinois public utility act  the icc regulations  the icc orders or icc policies or repeal of the illinois public utility act 
in such event  the revenues and profits from the affected qswefs may be materially adversely impacted 
the rate incentive received by each qswef  which must be reimbursed to the state of illinois  represents the excess of the gross contract rate received by such qswef from the public utility less the public utility s avoided cost 
therefore  the qswef s rate incentive and corresponding reimbursement obligation will depend  among other things  on the level of such avoided cost  which is beyond the control of the qswef 
loss of qswef status could trigger defaults under covenants to maintain qswef status in various purchase and loan agreements including the loans agreements with countryside fund and result in termination  penalties or acceleration of indebtedness under such agreements plus interest 
icc repayment liability the icc has broad powers to enforce and interpret the provisions of the illinois public utility act  icc regulations and icc orders 
in the future  the icc may promulgate new regulations and establish new policies or modify existing regulations and policies 
such actions  if taken and upheld by the courts  may have a materially adverse impact on some or all of the illinois based biogas projects 
the icc has enforcement authority to direct each owner of an illinois based biogas project to satisfy its reimbursement obligations  which authority may extend to  among other matters  the legal entity that is to hold the icc reimbursement account  the amount of funds to be deposited annually in the icc reimbursement account and the kinds of investments in which such funds are or may be invested 
although the icc has considered imposing and has imposed such requirements in the past as a condition to its approval of certain proposed transactions  it cannot be predicted with certainty whether and under what similar or different circumstances the icc may attempt to impose any of such requirements in the future 
however  provided the qswefs a remain in compliance in good faith with the current illinois public utilities act  icc regulations and icc orders  b make timely deposits to their icc reimbursement accounts that  together with earnings thereon from a reasonable and balanced investment portfolio  are reasonably sufficient to meet the qswefs reimbursement obligations to the state of illinois  and c do not seek approval from the icc for any transactions that require icc approval or modify existing icc orders  the we have no reason to believe that the icc will take any such actions respecting the qswefs in a manner materially adverse to them 
we believe that  as a result of the countryside fund transaction and related transactions  there will be no change in the ownership of any of such projects as such ownership is currently construed by the icc under its interpretation of applicable regulations of ferc 
however  as is described above  the icc has broad powers to enforce and interpret the relevant illinois statutes  the icc regulations and the icc orders 
it is therefore not possible to predict with any degree of certainty whether in a particular case the icc will determine that any degree or percentage of ownership is to be attributed to any particular entity 
nonetheless  based on a consideration of the factors that the icc considers relevant in a determination of the degree or percentage of ownership to be attributed to any particular entity  we believe that there is no reason to conclude that the icc would attribute a percentage ownership to any entity in respect of the biogas projects located in illinois so as to cause such projects to lose their status as qswefs or to constitute a change of ownership of such biogas projects  as a result of the countryside fund transaction and related transactions 
in the event the icc concluded that such transactions constituted a change in ownership of such biogas projects  such biogas projects would be required to seek icc approval of such change in ownership and would have to establish that  notwithstanding such change in ownership  such biogas projects still met the requirements of a qswef 
we cannot predict how the icc might exercise its discretion or its enforcement authority in such a circumstance 
under the rate incentive program  each qswef must begin to repay the incentive it has received to the state of illinois commencing no later that the earlier of the date the qswef has paid or otherwise satisfied in full the capital costs or indebtedness incurred in developing its facility and years after the date its facility commenced commercial operation  with such repayment to be completed no later than the earlier of years after such date of commencement of commercial operation and the end of its facility s actual useful life 
in order to meet this obligation  each qswef has established an icc reimbursement account in which it has deposited and will continue to deposit a portion of the incentive as it is received with the expectation that such deposits  when invested prudently in a balanced portfolio managed by professional advisors  will over time generate sufficient earnings to permit such qswef to meet its reimbursement obligations to the state of illinois as and when they come due 
however  in the event the icc exercised its enforcement authority in a manner that resulted in a lower return than expected or the investments in the icc reimbursement account otherwise do not generate the expected earnings  a qswef may not have sufficient funds to meet its obligations to reimburse the state of illinois when such obligations come due with potential material adverse consequences to the affected qswef
