overview puget energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its two subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are pse  a regulated electric and gas utility company  and infrastrux  a utility construction and services company 
puget sound energy pse generates revenues from the sale of electric and gas services  mainly to residential and commercial customers within washington state 
a majority of pse s revenues are generated in the first and fourth quarters during the winter heating season in washington state 
as a regulated utility company  pse is subject to ferc and washington commission regulation which may impact a large array of business activities  including limitation of future rate increases  directed accounting requirements that may negatively impact earnings  licensing of pse owned generation facilities  and other ferc and washington commission directives that may impact pse s long term goals 
in addition  pse is subject to risks inherent to the utility industry as a whole including weather changes affecting purchases and sales of energy  outages at owned and non owned generation plants where energy is obtained  storms which can damage transmission lines  and energy trading and wholesale market stability over time 
pse s main operational goal has been to provide cost effective and stable energy prices to its customers 
to help accomplish this goal  pse is attempting to be more self sufficient in energy generation resources 
owning more generation resources rather than purchasing power through contracts and on the wholesale market is intended to allow customers rates to remain stable 
as such  pse is in the process of purchasing a interest in a mw mw capacity with mw planned capital improvements gas fired generation facility within western washington  which is currently before the washington commission for approval in the power cost only rate case  with an expected order by mid april in addition  the purchase will also require approval from ferc 
pse has filed its application with ferc and anticipates approval in early this purchase is the first step of pse s long term electric least cost plan that was filed april  with the washington commission 
the plan supports a strategy of diverse resource acquisitions including resources fueled by natural gas and coal  renewable resources and shared resources 
infrastrux infrastrux generates revenues mainly from maintenance services and construction contracts in the south texas  north central and eastern united states 
a majority of its revenues are generated during the second and third quarters which are generally the most productive quarters for the construction industry due to longer daylight hours and generally better weather conditions 
infrastrux is subject to risks associated with the construction industry including inability to adequately estimate costs of projects that are bid upon under fixed fee contracts  continued economic downturn that limits the amount of projects available thereby reducing available profit margins from increased competition  the ability to integrate acquired companies within its operations without significant cost  and the ability to obtain adequate financing and bonding coverage to continue expansion and growth 
infrastrux s main goals have been continued growth and expansion into underdeveloped utility construction markets and to utilize its acquired entities to capitalize on depth of expertise  asset base  geographical location and workforce to provide services that local contractors cannot 
infrastrux has acquired entities since  including one acquisition in financial condition and results of operations puget energy all of the operations of puget energy are conducted through its subsidiaries  pse and infrastrux

in addition  federal tax refunds decreased in to million compared to million in net income was also negatively impacted by a decrease in infrastrux net income of million  net of minority interest  due to unusually wet weather affecting productivity in the first quarter of and increased competition in the marketplace 
net income in was positively impacted by an increase in utility net income of million from due to increased electric and gas margins resulting from general tariff rate increases 
in addition  net income was positively impacted by million of federal tax refunds in net income in was negatively impacted by a decrease in non utility net income of million primarily due to a decline in property sales from at pse s real estate investment and development subsidiary  puget western  inc  and an million gain on pse s sale of the assets in its connext subsidiary in august this was partially offset by an increase of million in net income  net of minority interest  at infrastrux

pse s operating revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly during the year 
variations in energy usage by consumers occur from season to season and from month to month within a season  primarily as a result of weather conditions 
pse normally experiences its highest retail energy sales during the heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
varying wholesale electric prices and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to pse also make quarter to quarter comparisons difficult 
the following is additional information pertaining to the changes outlined in the above table 
electric margin increased million for compared to due primarily to the non reoccurrence of losses associated with the resale of gas supply for electric generation 
electric margin increased million from to as a result of an increase in kwh sales and the full year effect of the general rate case

puget sound energy compared to operating revenues electric electric operating revenues increased million in compared to due primarily to an increase of million in wholesale electric sales to other utilities and marketers from greater surplus volumes 
wholesale sales volumes increased by billion kwh or compared to retail sales volumes increased to billion kwh as a result of increased usage by commercial customers in compared to electric operating revenues also increased by million due primarily to the non occurrence of losses on the sale of excess gas supply used for electric generation 
during  the benefits of the residential and farm energy exchange credit to customers reduced revenues by million compared to million in this credit also reduces power costs by a corresponding amount with no impact on earnings 
see item  business regulation and rates residential and small farm exchange credit for further discussion 
during  pse collected in its electric general rate tariff as a reduction to revenue and remitted to a grantor trust million as compared to million for as a result of pse s sale of future electric revenues associated with its investment in conservation assets 
the impact of the sale of revenue was offset by reductions in conservation amortization and interest expense 
pse s conservation trust transaction was consolidated in the third quarter of to meet the guidance of fasb interpretation no 
fin and  as a result  revenues increased million while conservation amortization and interest expense increased by a corresponding amount with no impact on earnings 
this amount was also forwarded to the grantor trust and any cash balance at the grantor trust is reported as restricted cash on the balance sheet 
at december   the balance sheet assets and liabilities have increased by million 
pse operates within the western wholesale market and has made sales into the california energy market 
during the fourth quarter of  pse made sales to the california energy market on which the receivable amount is still outstanding 
at december   pse s receivable from the california independent system operator caiso and other counterparties  net of reserves  was million 
see the discussion of the caiso receivable and california proceedings under proceedings relating to the western power market 
operating revenues gas regulated gas utility revenues in compared to decreased by million or due primarily to lower purchased gas adjustment pga rates in as a result of refunding the previous overcollection of pga gas costs 
in addition  warmer temperatures in resulted in fewer heating degree days as compared to resulting in lower therm sales 
pga rates charged to customers were lower in compared to as a result of rate decreases of and which took effect september  and november   respectively  offset by a rate increase of which took effect april  on september   the washington commission approved a pga rate increase of an annual average of across all groups of customers effective october  the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in gas pipeline transportation costs 
pse s gas margin gas sales to retail and transportation customers less pass through tariff items and revenue sensitive taxes  and the cost of gas purchased  including gas transportation costs to bring gas to pse s service territory and net income are not affected by changes under the pga 
other revenues other operating revenues decreased million primarily due to a decrease in property sales for puget western  inc which generates a majority of its revenue through the development and sale of property 
operating expenses purchased electricity expenses increased million in compared to pse s hydroelectric production and related power costs in were negatively impacted by below normal winter precipitation and snow pack in the pacific northwest region associated with an el nino weather condition 
the january  columbia basin runoff summary published by the national weather service northwest river forecast center indicated that the total observed runoff above grand coulee reservoir for the period january through december was of normal 
this compares to of normal for the same period in pse reached the million cumulative cap under the pca mechanism in primarily due to increased power costs and adverse hydro conditions 
under the pca mechanism  further increases in variable power costs through june  would be apportioned to customers and to pse 
to meet customer demand  pse dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil fuel generation  owned and contracted hydro capacity and energy  and long term contracted power 
however  depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy  plant availability  fuel prices and or changing load as a result of weather  pse may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market 
pse manages its core energy portfolio through short and intermediate term off system physical purchases and sales  and through other risk management techniques 
a pse risk management committee oversees energy portfolio exposures 
residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa increased million in compared to due to the impact of a full year s increased residential and farm energy exchange credit rate 
the rate increased in january  march and october of for residential and small farm customers 
discussion of the amended residential purchase and sale agreement between pse and bpa can be found under regulation and rates residential and small farm exchange credit 
the residential exchange credits are passed through to eligible residential and small farm customers by a corresponding reduction in revenues 
purchased gas expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in sales volume which was partially offset by an increase in gas market prices 
the pga allows pse to recover expected gas costs 
pse defers  as a receivable or liability  any gas costs that exceed or fall short of the amount in pga rates and accrues interest under the pga 
the pga liability balance at december  was million compared to a liability balance of million at december  electric generation fuel expense decreased million in compared to as a result of lower fuel costs for pse controlled gas fired generation facilities and the result of not operating the generating facilities due to available lower cost wholesale power supply 
unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments increased million in compared to as a result of unrealized losses on gas hedge contracts that were de designated in the fourth quarter of and settled in the unrealized gains and losses recorded in the income statement are the result of the change in the market value of derivative instruments not meeting cash flow hedge criteria 
for further discussion see note pse has had two contracts with a counterparty whose debt ratings were below investment grade since the first contract is a fixed for floating price natural gas swap contract for one of its electric generating facilities 
in the fourth quarter of  pse agreed to a novation of this contract to a new counterparty which has strong credit ratings 
as a result of the novation  the collateral that was held by the original counterparty was returned 
the fixed for floating price natural gas swap contract has been designated since inception in as a qualifying cash flow hedge 
the second contract  a physical gas supply contract for one of pse s electric generating facilities was marked to market in the fourth quarter of this contract was previously designated as a normal purchase under sfas no 
pse has concluded that it is appropriate to reserve the mark to market gain on this contract due to the credit quality of the counterparty in accordance with sfas no 
guidance  as delivery is not probable through the term of the contract  which expires in december production operations and maintenance costs decreased million in compared to due primarily to decreased operating costs of pse s combustion turbine plants which were operated at lower levels in than in due to lower wholesale power prices 
pse s personal energy management tm energy efficiency program costs decreased million in compared to reflecting a decreased emphasis on the program in light of relatively moderate energy prices and cancellation of the time of use program in november the low income program approved by the washington commission in the general rate case settlement began in july  which resulted in increased costs of million in compared to these costs are fully recovered in retail rates beginning at the program s inception on july  for electric service and september  for gas service 
other utility operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to an increase in electric overhead and underground line costs  gas distribution main costs  least cost planning costs  due diligence costs for power resource acquisition  certain costs associated with preparing the power cost only rate case and meter reading expenses 
also included in the results is pension income related to pse s defined benefit pension plan recorded under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
pension and benefit costs are allocated between capital and operations and maintenance expense based on the distribution of labor costs in accordance with ferc guidelines 
as a result  approximately of the annual qualified pension income of million for was recorded as a reduction in operations and maintenance expense compared to of million for qualified pension income is expected to decline to million in during the fourth quarter of  the puget sound region was hit by a severe windstorm that caused significant damage to pse s electric distribution system 
the windstorm is considered a catastrophic event under washington commission guidelines and as a result  pse was able to defer the repair cost of million for later recovery in retail rates 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to the effects of new plant placed in service during the past year 
conservation amortization increased million in compared to due to increased conservation expenditures and the result of consolidating the off balance sheet conservation trust beginning july  in accordance with fin the consolidation of the conservation trust increased conservation amortization by million for the period july through december pass through conservation costs are recovered through an electric conservation rider  a gas conservation tracker mechanism and a conservation trust rate schedule with no impact to earnings 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million in compared to primarily due to the property tax expense of million related to the state of oregon property tax bills covering a six year period ending june  not recurring in  a million reduction in expense in the second quarter of related to the settlement of the state of oregon property tax bills and a million decrease in revenue based washington state excise tax and municipal tax 
this was offset by a million increase in the state of washington property taxes 
income taxes increased million in compared to as a result of increased income offset by true ups related to filing the prior year s income tax returns that reduced income tax expense by million and a million reduction in tax expense related to the favorable resolution of a federal income tax matter from to in the second quarter of the increase is also the result of the refunds totaling million 
the million is composed of a million refund related to the audit of the company s and federal income tax returns  a million reduction to income tax expense representing an adjustment to federal income tax based on the federal tax return and a million reduction in expense related to a refund of federal income taxes for other income other income  net of federal income tax  decreased million compared to reflecting a million after tax downward adjustment of the carrying value of a non utility venture capital investment in the fourth quarter of interest charges interest charges decreased million for compared to primarily due to a decrease in long term and short term debt outstanding of million and the maturity of million of medium term notes with interest rates ranging from to during  the early redemption of million of medium term notes with interest rates ranging from to during  and the refinancing of million of pollution control bonds with interest rates ranging from to to rates ranging from to 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by the issuance of million of senior notes in may pse was able to pay maturing notes and redeem other notes mainly with additional equity investments by puget energy in and infrastrux the table below sets forth changes in the results of operations for infrastrux  net of minority interest

the following additional information pertains to the changes outlined in the table above 
infrastrux compared to infrastrux revenue increased million in compared to due primarily to acquisitions of several companies during and  which contributed to an increase of million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  infrastrux revenue decreased million from due primarily to general market weakness and changing activities on certain lines of business 
infrastrux records revenues as services are performed or on a percent of completion basis for fixed price projects 
infrastrux operations and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to due primarily to acquisitions of several companies during and  which contributed to an increase of million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  operations and maintenance expenses decreased million from due to lower productivity 
the decrease  excluding the impact of acquisitions  was not proportionate to the decline in revenues due to the impact of severe wet weather on productivity during the first quarter of as well as the high costs of completing work in low volume activities in depreciation and amortization increased by million in compared to due to acquisitions during and  which were not owned during the full year of income taxes decreased million in compared to due to lower income 
puget sound energy compared to operating revenues electric electric operating revenues decreased million in compared to due primarily to a decrease of million in wholesale electric sales to other utilities and marketers due to lower surplus volumes and substantially lower prices in the wholesale electricity market 
wholesale sales volumes decreased by billion kwh or 
retail sales revenue decreased primarily as a result of industrial and commercial customers on market index rates switching to transportation rate tariffs beginning in july  as allowed by a washington commission order dated april  authorizing the establishment of a new electric transportation rate tariff 
the decrease was offset by an interim electric rate surcharge in effect during the period april  through june   which increased electric revenue by million  and a electric general rate increase effective july   which increased electric revenue by approximately million in transportation revenues increased million and volume increased billion kwh in pse operates its combustion turbine plants located in western washington primarily as peaking plants when it is cost effective to do so 
during  pse operated its combustion turbine plants extensively to meet both on system and regional load requirements largely due to adverse hydroelectric conditions in the pacific northwest 
for  pse did not operate the combustion turbines to the extent it did in since market prices did not support the dispatching of these units  and pse could serve its customers with lower cost resources 
as a result  sales to other utilities and marketers declined in due to low wholesale energy prices and the reduction in operations of the combustion turbines 
on june   the washington commission approved and adopted the settlement stipulation in the general rate case  putting new rates into effect on july  and establishing a pca mechanism in the rate case settlement 
the mechanism will account for a sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels of power cost variances  with an overall cap of million over the four year period july  through june  the factors influencing the variability of power costs included in the proposal are primarily weather or market related 
operating revenues gas regulated gas utility revenues in compared to decreased by million due primarily to pga rate decreases as a result of lower natural gas prices that are passed through to customers 
gas delivered for transportation customers increased million or million therms in on august   the washington commission approved a decrease in pse s natural gas rates of due to lower natural gas costs purchased for customers under terms of the pga mechanism effective september  also  on may   the washington commission allowed a decrease in pga rates of to become effective on june  this ended a temporary surcharge that went into effect september  the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in gas pipeline transportation costs 
pse s gas margin and net income are not affected by changes under the pga 
on august   the washington commission approved a gas service rate increase in revenue to cover higher costs of providing natural gas service to customers 
this service related increase in revenues of approximately million annually was offset by an annual million or pga rate reduction  also approved on august  both rate actions became effective september  on september   pse filed a proposal with the washington commission to reduce natural gas supply rates under the pga for a third time in the washington commission approved the proposal on october  and pse lowered gas rates through the pga by approximately effective november  other revenues other operating revenues decreased million primarily due to a million decrease in the gross margin on property sales from pse s real estate investment and development subsidiary  puget western  inc operating expenses purchased electricity expenses decreased million in compared to due to the dramatic decline of wholesale electricity prices since june and an day unplanned outage of one of pse s mw combustion turbine electric generating units located at its fredonia generating station from february  to may   resulting in higher purchased electricity costs during in addition  the historic low hydroelectric power generation conditions experienced in in a high priced wholesale market forced pse to purchase additional energy during that period to meet retail electric customer loads 
in a normal water year  pse obtains about of its energy supply from low cost hydroelectric facilities  primarily from dams below grand coulee on the columbia river 
pse s share of the power costs through december  was million 
residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa increased million in compared to due to the amended residential purchase and sale agreement between pse and bpa reflecting increased benefits passed on to residential and small farm customers 
as of july  all residential exchange credits are passed through to eligible residential and small farm customers by a corresponding reduction in revenues 
purchased gas expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to the impact of decreased gas costs  which are passed through to customers through the pga mechanism  offset by a increase in sales volumes 
the pga allows pse to recover expected gas costs 
pse defers  as a receivable or liability  any gas costs that exceed or fall short of the amount in pga rates and accrues interest under the pga 
the pga balance was a receivable at december  of million while the balance at december  was a liability of million 
electric generation fuel expense decreased million in compared to as a result of decreased generation costs at pse controlled combustion turbine facilities and lower wholesale energy prices 
these facilities operated at much higher levels during compared to to meet retail electric customer loads due to adverse hydroelectric conditions in unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments during resulted in a decrease in expense of million 
the unrealized gains and losses recorded in the income statement are the result of the change in the market value of derivative instruments not meeting cash flow hedge criteria 
in addition  sfas no 
was adopted on january   and as a result  a one time million after tax transition loss was recorded in from recognizing the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
production operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to a million pre tax charge related to an industrial accident at colstrip units and  of which pse is a owner  overall higher operating costs for the colstrip generating facilities and the settlement of a combustion turbine insurance claim 
pse s personal energy management tm energy efficiency program costs decreased million in compared to  reflecting a decreased emphasis on the program in light of relatively moderate energy prices and cancellation of the time of use program in november a new low income program approved by the washington commission in the general rate case settlement began in july which resulted in increased costs of million in compared to these costs are fully recovered in retail rates beginning at the program s inception on july  for electric and september  for gas 
other utility operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to higher expense related to a one time pse employee severance cost totaling million related to strategic outsourcing of operations work to service providers  and an overall increase in administrative and meter reading expenses 
also included in the results is pension income related to pse s defined benefit pension plan recorded under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
pension and benefit costs are allocated between capital and operations and maintenance expenses based on the distribution of labor costs in accordance with ferc accounting instructions 
as a result  approximately of the annual qualified pension income of million for was recorded as a reduction in operations and maintenance expense compared to of million for pse s other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses at connext  the assets of which were sold in the third quarter of depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to due primarily to the effects of additional plant placed into service at pse during conservation amortization increased million in compared to due to increased conservation expenditures 
these costs are recovered in conservation rider and tracker mechanisms with no impact to earnings 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million in compared to due primarily to a decrease in revenue based washington state excise tax and municipal tax 
this was offset by a municipal tax expense of million recorded in related to various claims by cities that pse underpaid municipal taxes owed as a result of not collecting the tax in certain rural areas that were annexed by cities 
the offset also includes a one time property tax expense of million covering a six year period ending june  related to oregon state property tax bills on pse s long term third ac transmission intertie contract 
income taxes decreased million in compared to the decrease in included a total of million in refunds at pse which are composed of million related to the audit of the company s and federal income tax returns  a million reduction to expense representing an adjustment to federal income taxes based on the federal tax return and a million reduction in expense recorded in the fourth quarter of related to a refund of federal income taxes for other income other income  net of federal income tax  decreased million in compared to due primarily to a one time million after tax gain realized by pse on the sale of connext s assets in the third quarter of interest charges interest charges  which consist of interest and amortization on long term debt and other interest  increased million in compared to primarily as a result of a full year s interest expense on the issuance of million trust preferred securities in may other interest expense increased due primarily to a pga liability over recovery of gas costs in rates in compared to a pga asset under recovery of gas costs in rates in under the pga mechanism  interest is accrued on deferred balances 
infrastrux compared to infrastrux revenue increased million in compared to due primarily to acquisitions of several companies during and  which contributed to an increase of million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  infrastrux revenue increased million from and was impacted positively by ice storm restoration work performed in oklahoma by infrastrux s texas companies and continued strong performance of remediation services in the utility industry 
infrastrux records revenues as services are performed or on a percent of completion basis for fixed price projects 
infrastrux operations and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to acquisitions during and  which contributed to an increase of million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  infrastrux operations and maintenance expenses increased million from and were impacted by the increase of corporate infrastructure to support a growing organization  additional costs of direct wages  construction costs and higher insurance costs incurred to support an increased revenue base 
depreciation and amortization increased by million in compared to due to acquisitions during and  which contributed million 
increases in depreciation of million from core companies were due primarily to the acquisition of strategic assets to support areas of infrastrux where significant growth opportunities exist

off balance sheet arrangements accounts receivable securitization program in order to provide a source of liquidity for pse at attractive cost of capital rates  pse entered into a receivables sales agreement with rainier receivables  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of pse  in december pursuant to the receivables sales agreement  pse sold all of its utility customer accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenues to rainier receivables 
concurrently with entering into the receivables sales agreement  rainier receivables entered into a receivables purchase agreement with pse and a third party 
the receivables purchase agreement allows rainier receivables to sell the receivables purchased from pse to the third party 
the amount of receivables sold by rainier receivables is not permitted to exceed million at any time 
however  the maximum amount may be less than million depending on the outstanding amount of pse s receivables which fluctuate with the seasonality of energy sales to customers 
the receivables securitization facility is the functional equivalent of a secured revolving line of credit 
in the event rainier receivables elects to sell receivables under the receivables purchase agreement  rainier receivables is required to pay the purchasers fees that are comparable to interest rates on a revolving line of credit 
as receivables are collected by pse as agent for the receivables purchasers  the outstanding amount of receivables purchased by the purchasers declines until rainier receivables elects to sell additional receivables to the purchasers 
the receivables securitization facility has a three year term  but is terminable by pse and rainier receivables upon notice to the receivables purchasers 
at december   rainier receivables had sold million in accounts receivable and the maximum remaining receivables available for sale was million 
fredonia and operating lease pse leases two combustion turbines for its fredonia and electric generating facility pursuant to a master operating lease that was amended for this purpose in april the lease has a term expiring in  but can be canceled by pse after august payments under the lease vary with changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
at december   pse s outstanding balance under the lease was million 
the expected residual value under the lease is the lesser of million or of the cost of the equipment 
in the event the equipment is sold to a third party upon termination of the lease and the aggregate sales proceeds are less than the unamortized value of the equipment  pse would be required to pay the lessor contingent rent in an amount equal to the deficiency up to a maximum of of the unamortized value of the equipment 
utility construction program current utility construction expenditures for generation  transmission and distribution are designed to meet continuing customer growth and to improve efficiencies of pse s energy delivery systems 
construction expenditures  excluding equity allowance for funds used during construction afudc  were million in pse expects construction expenditures will be approximately million in  which includes million for new generating resources subject to regulatory approval 
the proposed generating resource  if approved in  will be funded initially with short term debt 
construction expenditure estimates are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and conservation factors 
new generation resources in october  pse completed negotiations to purchase a interest in a mw mw capacity with mw planned capital improvements gas fired electric generating facility located within pse s service territory 
the purchase will add approximately mw of electric generation capacity to serve pse s retail customers 
pse submitted a power cost only rate case in october to the washington commission to recover the approximately million cost of the new generating facility and other power costs 
the power cost only rate case is expected to last approximately five months 
accordingly  the acquisition of the plant is subject to approval by the washington commission  and is expected by mid april in addition  the acquisition will require approval from ferc 
pse filed its application in january with ferc and anticipates approval in early in addition  pse has issued an rfp to acquire approximately average mw of energy from wind power for its electric resource portfolio 
pse issued an rfp in february for approximately mw of thermal and other generation with proposals due back in march other additions other property  plant and equipment additions were million in puget energy expects infrastrux s capital additions to be million  million and million in  and  respectively 
construction expenditure estimates are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and conservation factors 
capital resources cash from operations cash generated from operations totaled million at december  during the period  million in cash was used for afudc and payment of dividends 
consequently  cash available for utility construction expenditures and other capital expenditures was million or of the million in construction expenditures net of afudc and other capital expenditure requirements for the period 
for the same period in  cash generated from operations was million  million of which was used for afudc and payment of dividends 
therefore  cash available for utility construction expenditures and other capital expenditures at december  was million 
the reduction in cash generated from operations in was primarily due to refunds reducing the pga balance and the reduction in cash received related to deferred tax items in during  pse received million in excess of actual gas costs from customers through the pga mechanism compared to refunds to customers through the pga mechanism of million for cash from deferred income taxes decreased million due primarily to federal income tax refunds and deferred tax credits in that did not occur in there was also a million decrease in cash flows as a result of returning collateral to an energy trading counterparty in compared to a million increase in cash flow from receiving the collateral in cash from materials and supplies decreased million due predominantly to higher gas injections in as compared to in order to increase gas storage levels 
cash used for accounts payable decreased million due to fewer accrued incentives and operating related costs at the end of in  pse also funded the qualified pension plan in the amount of million compared to no funding during cash used for taxes payable increased in compared to by million 
financing program financing utility construction requirements and operational needs is dependent upon the amount of internally generated funds and the cost and availability of external funds through capital markets and from financial institutions 
access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic conditions  regulatory authorizations and policies  and puget energy s and pse s credit ratings 
restrictive covenants in determining the type and amount of future financing  pse may be limited by restrictions contained in its electric and gas mortgage indentures  articles of incorporation and certain loan agreements 
under the most restrictive tests  at december   pse could issue approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds based upon approximately billion of electric and gas bondable property available for use for issuance subject to the interest coverage ratio limitation of times net earnings available for interest 
pse s interest coverage ratio at december  was times net earnings available for interest  approximately million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of  and approximately million of unsecured long term debt 
credit ratings neither puget energy nor pse has any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt 
however  a downgrade in the companies credit ratings could adversely affect their ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities 
for example  under pse s revolving credit facility  the spreads over the index and commitment fee increase as pse s secured long term debt ratings decline 
a downgrade in commercial paper ratings could preclude pse s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs 
the marketability of pse commercial paper is currently limited by the a p ratings by standard poor s and moody s investors service 
in addition  downgrades in any or a combination of pse s debt ratings may allow counterparties on a contract by contract basis in the wholesale electric  wholesale gas and financial derivative markets to require pse to post a letter of credit or other collateral  make cash prepayments  obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security

the proceeds of million were invested in pse and mainly used to repay debt and redeem high cost preferred stock 
during  pse redeemed the following long term debt million notes and junior subordinated debt of a subsidiary trust in february with interest rates ranging from to  million notes at an interest rate of in march  million notes at interest rates ranging from to in may million notes at interest rates ranging from to in august  and million notes at interest rates ranging from to in december liquidity facilities and commercial paper pse has a million unsecured credit agreement with various banks which expires in june and a million three year receivables securitization program which expires in december the receivables available for sale under the securitization program may be less than million depending on the outstanding amount of pse s receivables which fluctuate with the seasonality of energy sales to customers 
at december   pse had available million in the unsecured credit agreement and million available from the receivables securitization facility net of million sold  which provide credit support for outstanding commercial paper and outstanding letters of credit 
at december   there were no outstanding amounts under its commercial paper program and million under the letters of credit  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under the liquidity facilities to million 
on may   puget energy entered into a million  three year credit agreement with a bank 
under the terms of the agreement  puget energy will pay a floating interest rate on borrowings based on the libor 
the interest rate is set for one  two or three month periods at the option of puget energy with interest due at the end of each period 
puget energy will also pay a commitment fee on any unused portion of the credit facility 
on may   puget energy borrowed million under the credit agreement 
the proceeds of the loan were invested in infrastrux  which used the proceeds to acquire a construction services company in new mexico 
in june  infrastrux signed a three year credit agreement with several banks to provide up to million in financing 
puget energy is the guarantor of the line of credit 
in addition  infrastrux s subsidiaries have an additional million in lines of credit with various banks 
borrowings available for infrastrux are used to fund acquisitions and working capital requirements of infrastrux and its subsidiaries 
at december   infrastrux and its subsidiaries had outstanding loans of million and letters of credit of million  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under these lines of credit to million 
stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan puget energy has a stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to which shareholders and other interested investors may invest cash and cash dividends in shares of puget energy s common stock 
since new shares of common stock may be purchased directly from puget energy  funds received may be used for general corporate purposes 
puget energy issued common stock from the stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan of million  shares in compared to million  shares in common stock offering programs to provide additional financing options  puget energy entered into agreements in july with two financial institutions under which puget energy may offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time through these institutions as sales agents  or as principals 
sales of the common stock  if any  may be made by means of negotiated transactions or in transactions that may be deemed to be at the market offerings as defined in rule promulgated under the securities act of  including in ordinary brokers transactions on the new york stock exchange at market prices 
in october  puget energy sold  shares of common stock under its program with cantor fitzgerald company 
puget energy received approximately million in net proceeds from these sales 
proceedings relating to the western power market while pse cannot predict the outcome of any of the individual ongoing proceedings relating to the western power markets  pse generally is pleased that ferc appears to be narrowing the issues under review in the cases pending before it 
the narrowing of issues allows pse to compare the allegations in the various proceedings with pse s relevant records and to better anticipate the likely outcome of each case 
in the aggregate  pse does not expect the ultimate resolution of the issues and cases discussed below to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
california independent system operator caiso receivable and california refund proceedings pse operates within the western wholesale market and made sales into the california energy market during the fourth quarter of through the caiso 
in august of  san diego gas electric company filed a complaint at ferc docket no 
el seeking price caps on energy sold into the caiso and the california power exchange px markets 
the complaint also sought refunds of prices charged above any such caps put in place 
in response to the complaint  after a number of orders that attempted to address the california energy crisis in a variety of manners  ferc issued an order on june  that imposed caps on prices beginning the next day 
on july   ferc ordered an evidentiary hearing in docket no 
el to determine the amount of refunds due to california energy buyers  including the caiso  for purchases made in the spot markets operated by the caiso during the period october  through june  on december   the administrative law judge conducting the hearings issued his certification of proposed findings on california refund liability to ferc 
the certification includes an appendix that reflects what the administrative law judge labeled as ballpark estimates of amounts owed and owing 
the certification also stated that the amounts owing should be adjusted for interest  a calculation the administrative law judge did not make 
the ferc staff issued a report in august docket no 
pa that  among other things  recommended that ferc modify the methodology for calculating refunds in the california refund proceeding docket no 
el by adopting  as a proxy for the cost of natural gas  producing basin spot prices plus transportation costs  instead of reported spot prices for natural gas at california delivery points 
this methodology of calculating the cost of natural gas further reduced the amount owed by the caiso to pse for sales made during and the current net receivable recorded by pse is million 
the caiso receivable range including the effects of the caiso refund and estimates of the gas price adjustment  including interest is between million and million 
on november   ferc issued an order on motion for discovery order in docket no 
el that granted a motion to allow parties to adduce additional evidence into the refund proceedings that is either indicative or counter indicative of market manipulation 
the order also authorized an appointment of an administrative law judge as a discovery master  and permitted the parties to conduct discovery and file any such evidence with ferc 
in their march  filing  the california parties reiterated their allegations of market manipulation against pse and approximately other companies 
pse and the other parties responded on march  on march   ferc issued an order on proposed findings on refund liability in docket no 
el that substantially adopted the recommendations that the administrative law judge made on december   except that the order also substantially adopted the ferc staff gas price recommendation made in its august report 
on october   ferc issued an order on rehearing that largely left the refund calculation methodologies established by the march  order unchanged 
the order on rehearing gives the caiso a deadline to perform its cost re runs which are expected to establish actual amounts owing and owed of five months from october  in february  however  ferc issued an order giving the caiso an indefinite period of time to complete its cost re runs  subject to the caiso filing monthly reports of its progress and its expected completion dates 
the caiso s current estimates are that it will be unable to complete the cost re run process any earlier than august until the caiso completes its cost re run process  little other activity can take place in the ferc docket 
the march  order on proposed findings on refund liability also permitted generators to make a filing to recover actual fuel costs that exceeded the calculated proxy price under the staff methodology 
pse made such a filing on may  the california parties objected to all fuel cost filings on may  the order on rehearing issued on october  postpones resolution of this issue  so pse s application for fuel cost recovery remains pending 
the order on rehearing issued on october  also expressly adopted and approved a stipulation that confirmed that two pse non spot market transactions were not subject to refund 
the total gross revenue associated with the transactions is approximately million 
on october   pse sent a demand letter to the caiso seeking payment of the amount due 
the caiso responded to the letter with its own letter of november   expressing an unwillingness to take the issue up separately or in advance of its cost re run activities 
pse has not yet formally responded to that letter 
because of the numerous orders ferc has issued in docket no 
el over a period of more than three years  more than appeals from the proceeding have already been lodged with the us ninth circuit court of appeals 
the ninth circuit s usual practice has been to consolidate those appeals as they are filed  and hold the appellate proceedings in abeyance pending a final determination by ferc of the issues before it 
pse has no ability to predict how soon the ninth circuit may choose to take up these matters for consideration on their merits  but the california parties have attempted to initiate a more active review from time to time 
it is likely that the case will not be finally resolved before formal appellate review 
california receivable in  pg e and southern california edison defaulted on payment obligations owed to various energy suppliers  including the caiso and the california px 
the caiso in turn defaulted on its payment obligations to pse and various other energy suppliers 
the california px itself filed bankruptcy in  further constraining pse s ability to receive payments due to controls placed on the california px s distribution of funds by the california px bankruptcy court and due to the fact that the vast majority of funds owed directly to the caiso are owed by the california px 
in addition  the california px s inverse condemnation action against the state of california may influence the delivery of funds to energy sellers such as pse 
pse has a bad debt reserve and a transaction fee reserve applied to the caiso receivables  such that the net receivable at december  was million 
on march   southern california edison paid its past due energy obligations to the caiso  the california px and various other parties  however  those funds were not used to pay the outstanding balance of the caiso obligations to pse 
in summary  the developments in the california refund proceeding described in the above section have the likely effect of reducing pse s gross receivable balance due from the caiso to an amount approximately equivalent to collecting payment on the two non spot market transactions removed from the refund proceeding 
pse is attempting early collection of proceeds associated with those sales while recognizing that the ultimate resolution of the refund proceeding may be more distant in the future 
pse anticipates that the net results of the caiso cost re runs and the application of the refund calculations will extinguish or offset the caiso receivable apart from the balance associated with the two non spot market transactions 
pse is continuing to pursue recovery of the caiso receivable 
pacific northwest refund proceeding in october  pse filed a complaint at ferc creating docket no 
el against all jurisdictional sellers in the pacific northwest seeking prospective price caps consistent with any result ferc supplied for the california markets 
ferc dismissed pse s complaint on december   although pse filed for rehearing in january when ferc issued its june  order in docket no 
el  imposing west wide price constraints on energy sales  pse moved to withdraw its rehearing request and its complaint in the el docket  on the basis that the relief pse sought was fully provided 
various parties  including the port of seattle and the cities of seattle and tacoma  moved to intervene in the proceeding 
they asserted the ability to adopt pse s complaint to obtain retroactive refunds for numerous transactions  including many that were not within the scope of the pse complaint 
the proceeding became commonly referenced as the pacific northwest refund proceeding  despite the fact that the original complainant  pse  did not seek retroactive refunds 
a preliminary evidentiary hearing was held in september  and an administrative law judge recommendation against refunds followed 
in december  ferc issued an order permitting additional discovery and the submission of any additional evidence parallel to the order issued in the california refund proceeding that reopened the matter to permit parties to introduce any evidence they claimed to have of market manipulation 
a few parties made filings  asserting market manipulation in early march  and numerous parties  including pse  responded to those allegations in late march on june   ferc issued an order terminating the proceeding  largely on procedural  jurisdictional and equitable grounds 
various parties filed rehearing requests on july  on november   ferc denied the rehearing requests  and the matter has now been appealed to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
pse has filed its own appeal  on the basis that it had an absolute right to withdraw the complaint before any other party intervened 
the california parties also sought rehearing on one new issue decided in the november  order  which request was denied by ferc on february  it is expected that all appeals from this proceeding will be consolidated and resolved together 
orders to show cause on june   ferc issued two show cause orders pertaining to its western market investigations that commenced individual proceedings against many sellers 
one show cause proceeding seeks to investigate approximately entities that allegedly had potential partnerships with enron 
pse was not named in that show cause order  and in an order dismissing many of the already named respondents in the partnerships proceedings on january   ferc stated that they had determined not to proceed further against other parties 
accordingly  pse does not expect to be named in the case 
the second show cause proceeding investigated approximately entities that allegedly had engaged in potential gaming practices in the caiso and california px markets 
pse is one of the entities named in the gaming show cause order docket no 
el 
on july   caiso provided data to ferc in connection with the gaming show cause order that indicated that  under the standards adopted by ferc in the june  orders  caiso s previously reported claims against pse as to ricochet transactions completely disappear 
consistent with the show cause orders invitation to attempt settlement  pse and ferc staff filed a settlement of all issues pending against pse in those proceedings on august  the proposed settlement admits no wrongdoing on the part of pse  but would result in the payment of  to settle all claims 
the california parties and a few others filed oppositions to pse s settlement and all others on september  pse replied to those arguments on october  the presiding administrative law judge certified and recommended the pse settlement to ferc on november  in january  ferc issued an order approving contested settlement agreement that finds pse s settlement to be in the public interest 
on february   motions for rehearing were filed by the port of seattle and the california parties the california attorney general  the california public utilities commission  the california electricity oversight board  pg e and southern california edison 
pse continues to believe that the orders to show cause do not raise new issues or concerns nor will they have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
anomalous bidding investigation on june   ferc issued an order commencing a new investigatory proceeding  docket no 
in  to be conducted through its office of market oversight and investigations omoi 
that docket is to review each seller s bids into the caiso or california px markets that exceeded mwh during the period of may  to october  the omoi is to determine if each such entity s bids show a pattern or an effort to manipulate the market  and if they do  to consider whether the entity should be required to disgorge any improper profits earned as a result of such patterns or efforts 
pse received a data request from the omoi in this proceeding about its bids and responded on july  pse has not received further information requests since responding 
there is no established timetable for this proceeding  but ferc has indicated that it expects to work diligently to review the practices of each seller and to resolve the matter expeditiously 
pse does not expect any material adverse impacts on the financial condition of the company from this ferc investigation 
port of seattle suit on may   the port of seattle commenced suit in federal court in seattle  washington against energy sellers into the california market  alleging that the conduct of those sellers during and constituted market manipulation  violated antitrust laws and damaged the port of seattle  which had a contract to purchase its complete energy supply from pse at the time 
the port s contract with pse linked the price of the energy sold to the port to an index price for energy sold at wholesale at the mid columbia trading hub 
the port alleged that the mid columbia price was intentionally affected improperly by the defendants  including pse 
pse moved to dismiss this case  other defendants moved to transfer the matter to a multi district litigation panel in california 
a conditional transfer order was issued in july after further proceedings before the judicial panel on multi district litigation  an order transferring the case to the southern district of california was entered on december  pse s motion to dismiss remains pending and is scheduled to be heard on march  in san diego  california 
pse does not expect any material adverse impacts on the financial condition of the company from this matter 
california attorney general cases on may   ferc conditionally dismissed a complaint filed on march  by the california attorney general in docket no 
el that alleged violations of the fpa by ferc and all sellers including pse of electric power and energy into california 
the complaint asserted that ferc s adoption and implementation of market rate authority was flawed and  as a result  individual sellers such as pse were liable for sales of energy at rates that were unjust and unreasonable 
the condition for dismissal was that all sellers refile transaction summaries of sales to and  after a clarifying order issued on june   purchases from certain california entities during and pse refiled such transaction summaries on july and july  the order of dismissal is now on appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
on the same day as ferc s order of dismissal in docket no 
el was entered  the california attorney general announced it had filed individual complaints against a number of sellers  including pse  in california superior court in san francisco 
that complaint alleged that pse s sales to california violated the requirements of the fpa and that  as such  the sales also violated certain sections of the california business practices act forbidding unlawful business practices 
the complaint asserted that each such violation subjects pse to a fine of up to  plus an award of attorneys fees and asserts that there were thousands of such violations 
pse removed that suit to federal court and moved to dismiss it on the grounds that the issues are within the exclusive or primary jurisdiction of ferc 
on march   the court granted the motion for dismissal 
the order of dismissal is now on appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
pse does not expect any material adverse impacts on the financial condition of the company from these matters 
california class actions during may  pse was served with two cross complaints  by reliant energy services and duke energy trading marketing  respectively  in six consolidated class actions pending in superior court in san diego  california 
the original complaints in the action  which were brought by or on behalf of electricity purchasers in california  allege that the original approximately defendants manipulated the wholesale electricity markets in violation of various california business practices act or cartwright act antitrust provisions 
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit seek  among other things  restitution of all funds acquired by means that violate the law and payment of treble damages  interest and penalties 
the cross complaints assert essentially that the cross defendants  including pse  were also participants in the energy market in california at the relevant times  and that any remedies ordered against some market participants should be ordered against all 
reliant energy services and duke energy trading marketing also seek indemnity and conditional relief as a buyer in transactions involving cross defendants should the plaintiffs prevail 
those cross complaints added over new defendants  including pse  to litigation that had been pending since and had been set for trial in state court 
some of the newly added defendants removed the litigation to federal court 
the federal court in san diego remanded the case to the california state court in an order issued in december pse and numerous other defendants added by the cross complaints have moved to dismiss these claims 
those motions were argued on september   but the federal judge did not rule on those motions in his order remanding the case to state court 
the remand order is now being reconsidered 
pse and the other defendants that moved to dismiss the claims intend to submit their motion to the appropriate court at the earliest practical date 
as a result of the various motions  no trial date is set at this time 
pse does not expect the ultimate resolution of these matters to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations or liquidity of the company 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following areas represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered  including estimates used for unbilled revenue 
unbilled kwh are determined by taking kwh generated and purchased less billed kwh and estimated system losses 
the estimated system losses are determined by reviewing historical billed kwh to generated and purchased kwh 
this amount is then multiplied by the estimated average revenue per kwh 
non utility revenue is recognized when services are performed  upon the sale of assets  or on a percentage of completion basis for fixed price contracts 
the recognition of revenue is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue 
regulatory accounting puget energy s regulated subsidiary  pse  prepares its financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and in conformity with ferc s uniform system of accounts 
the washington commission also requires pse to use ferc s uniform system of accounts 
the reason pse prepares its financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
is that its rates and tariffs are regulated by the washington commission and ferc 
the rates that are charged by pse to its customers are based upon cost base regulation reviewed and approved by these regulatory commissions 
under the authority of these commissions  pse has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities in the amount of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
if at some point in the future puget energy determines that it no longer meets the criteria for continued application of sfas no 
with respect to pse  puget energy could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
derivatives puget energy uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its commodity price risks 
derivative financial instruments are accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for derivatives continues to evolve through guidance issued by the derivatives implementation group dig of the financial accounting standards board 
to the extent that changes by the dig modify current guidance  including the normal purchases and normal sales determination  the accounting treatment for derivatives may change 
to manage its electric and gas portfolios  puget energy enters into contracts to purchase or sell electricity and gas 
these contracts are considered derivatives under sfas no 
unless a determination is made that they qualify for normal purchases and normal sales exclusion 
if the exclusion applies  those contracts are not marked to market and are not reflected in the financial statements until delivery occurs 
the availability of the normal purchases and normal sales exclusion to specific contracts is based on a determination that a resource is available for a forward sale and similarly a determination that at certain times existing resources will be insufficient to serve load 
this determination is based on internal models that forecast customer demand and generation supply 
the models include assumptions regarding customer load growth rates  which are influenced by the economy  weather and the impact of customer choice  and resource availability 
the critical assumptions used in the determination of normal purchases and normal sales are consistent with assumptions used in the general planning process 
energy contracts that are considered derivatives may be eligible for designation as cash flow hedges

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
portfolio management the nature of serving regulated electric customers with its wholesale portfolio of owned and contracted resources exposes the company and its customers to some volumetric and commodity price risks within the sharing mechanism of the pca 
the company s energy risk management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools 
the company manages its energy supply portfolio to achieve three primary objectives ensure that physical energy supplies are available to serve retail customer requirements  manage portfolio risks to limit undesired impacts on the company s costs  and maximize the value of the company s energy supply assets 
the portfolio is subject to major sources of variability eg  hydro generation  outage risk  regional economic factors  temperature sensitive retail sales  and market prices for gas and power supplies 
at certain times  these sources of variability can mitigate portfolio imbalances  at other times they can exacerbate portfolio imbalances 
the company s energy risk management staff develops hedging strategies for the company s energy supply portfolio 
the first priority is to obtain reliable supply for delivery to the company s retail customers 
the second priority is to protect against unwanted risk exposure 
the third priority is to optimize excess capacity or flexibility within the wholesale portfolio 
most hedges can be implemented in ways that retain the company s ability to use its energy supply optimization opportunities 
other hedges are structured similarly to insurance instruments  where pse pays an insurance premium to protect against certain extreme conditions 
portfolio exposure is managed in accordance with company polices and procedures 
the risk management committee  which is composed of company officers  provides policy level and strategic direction for management of the energy portfolio 
the audit committee of the company s board of directors has oversight of the risk management committee 
the prices of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  generation outages and other factors which impact supply and demand 
the volumetric and commodity price risk is a consequence of purchasing energy at fixed and variable prices and providing deliveries at different tariffs and variable prices 
costs associated with ownership and operation of production facilities are another component of this risk 
the company may use forward physical delivery agreements and financial derivatives for the purpose of hedging commodity price risk 
without jeopardizing the security of supply within its portfolio  the company will also engage in optimizing the portfolio 
optimization may take the form of utilizing excess capacity  shaping flexible resources to capture their highest value  utilizing transmission capacity or capitalizing on market price movement 
as a result  portions of the company s energy portfolio are monetized through the use of forward price instruments 
the regulatory mechanisms of the pga and the pca mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility upon the company 
the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases and decreases in the cost of natural gas supply 
the pca mechanism provides for a sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels of power cost variances with an overall cap of million plus of the excess over the million cap over the four year period ending june  transactions that qualify as hedge transactions under sfas no 
are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in fair value of the company s derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income 
short term derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity are valued based upon daily quoted prices from an independent energy brokerage service 
valuations for short term and medium term natural gas financial derivatives are derived from a combination of quotes from several independent energy brokers and are updated daily 
long term gas financial derivatives are valued based on published pricing from a combination of independent brokerage services and are updated monthly 
option contracts are valued using market quotes and a monte carlo simulation based model approach 
at december   the company had an after tax net asset of approximately million of energy contracts designated as qualifying cash flow hedges and a corresponding unrealized gain recorded in other comprehensive income 
of the amount in other comprehensive income  has been reclassified out of other comprehensive income to a deferred account due to the company reaching the million cap under the pca mechanism 
the company also had energy contracts that were marked to market at a loss through current earnings for of million 
a hypothetical increase in the market prices of natural gas and electricity would increase the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges by approximately million after tax and would increase current earnings for those contracts marked to market in earnings by an immaterial amount 
derivative contracts dollars in millions amounts fair value of contracts outstanding december  
contracts realized or otherwise settled during

interest rate risk the company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short term debt instruments  variable rate leases and long term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements 
the company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt of various maturities 
the company utilizes bank borrowings  commercial paper  line of credit facilities and accounts receivable securitization to meet short term cash requirements 
these short term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable 
the company may enter into swap instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts
