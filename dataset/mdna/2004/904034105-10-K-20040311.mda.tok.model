due to these and additional factors  certain statements  historical results and percentage relationships discussed below are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  warranty obligations  purchase order commitments  bad debts  income taxes  intangible assets  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company has reviewed these policies with its audit committee 
revenue recognition in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force issued eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets  and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
it does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
it applies to arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
under the provisions of eitf  separate units of accounting exist if all of the following criteria are met the item has value on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  delivery of the undelivered item is probable and in control of the company  and consideration allocable to the delivered item is not contingent on delivery of additional items 
in response to eitf  the company has reviewed its arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
the company has concluded that the adoption of eitf has no material effect on its current revenue recognition policy 
although application of eitf results in the identification of separate accounting units  eg the system and its installation  the company believes that all required elements of revenue recognition under sab are not met at the time of shipment of its systems 
therefore  revenue recognition for systems must be delayed until all elements of revenue recognition are met  generally upon acceptance of the system 
accordingly  the company recognizes revenues on system sales when the contractual obligation for installation if any has been satisfied  or installation is substantially complete  and or customer acceptance provisions have lapsed  or generally if the customer has placed the system into production  provided collections of the related receivable are probable 
in the event of a delay in the installation of the company s products caused by the customer  the company may seek acceptance of the system and warranty commencement after shipment and transfer of title  but prior to completion of installation 
revenue recorded as a result of these customer acceptances is reduced by an amount representing the fair value of installation services 
in these instances  revenue is recorded only if the product has met product specifications prior to shipment and management deems that no significant uncertainties as to product performance exist 
the company generally recognizes revenue from spare parts sales upon shipment 
the company has concluded that the adoption of eitf has no material effect on its current revenue recognition policy with regards to spare parts  as these revenue arrangements generally do not contain multiple elements 
the company sells time based service contracts for which revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period  and service contracts based on a purchased quantity of hours under which revenue is recognized as service hours are delivered 
the company recognizes revenue from licensing and technology support agreements ratably over the contract period  or the estimated useful life of the licensed technologies  whichever is shorter 
inventories and purchase order commitments the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the company performs a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements and market conditions 
based on this analysis  the company records adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at lower of cost or market 
in fiscal  demand for the company s products was adversely affected by the downturn in the global economy and reduced capital spending 
although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of its inventory and its reported operating results 
in the future  if the company finds that its estimates are too optimistic and it determines that its inventory needs to be written down  the company will be required to recognize such costs in its cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if the company finds its estimates are too pessimistic and it subsequently sells product that has previously been written down  its gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
warranty obligations the company provides for the estimated cost of its product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage rates and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected 
should actual product failure rates  material usage rates and labor efficiencies differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could result in future charges or credits to the company s gross margins 
bad debt the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments and for returns and allowances 
this reserve is established based upon historical trends  current economic conditions and an analysis of specific exposures 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  or even a single customer was otherwise unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the average selling price of the company s systems is in excess of million 
accordingly  a single customer default could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
deferred taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   the valuation allowance was million 
based on the uncertainty of future pre tax income for us tax purposes  the company has presently fully reserved its domestic deferred tax assets 
at december   the company has recorded approximately million of foreign deferred tax assets related to its japanese operations 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize the domestic deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation reserve would increase income through an increase in the company s income tax benefit in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the company derives a substantial portion of its total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems  which typically range in price from million to million 
as a result of these high sale prices  the timing and recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and most likely will continue to have a significant impact on the company s net sales and operating results for any particular period 
the company s backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve the company s sales objectives for that period 
in addition  orders in backlog are subject to cancellation  shipment or customer acceptance delays  and deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties 
consequently  the company s net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependent upon the company obtaining orders for systems to be shipped and accepted in the same period in which the order is received 
the company s business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment and customer acceptance during that period 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the company s shipments has historically been realized near the end of each quarter 
delays in installation and customer acceptance due  for example  to the inability of the company to successfully demonstrate the agreed upon specifications or criteria at the customer s facility  or to the failure of the customer to permit installation of the system in the agreed upon time  may cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below the company s expectations  which may materially adversely affect the company s operating results for that period 
additionally  the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments due  for example  to rescheduling  delays  deferrals or cancellations by customers  additional customer configuration requirements  or to unexpected manufacturing difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or otherwise  have caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below the company s expectations  materially adversely affecting the company s operating results for that period 
in particular  the long manufacturing cycles of the company s saturn spectrum family of wafer steppers  laser thermal processing systems and the long lead time for lenses and other materials  could cause shipments of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter 
additionally  the need for continued expenditures for research and development  capital equipment  ongoing training and worldwide customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for the company to reduce its operating expenses in a particular period if the company fails to achieve its net sales goals for the period 
net sales vs

system sales increased  to million  on a unit volume increase of 
excluding reduction lithography systems  which have been discontinued by the company  system sales increased to million  on a unit volume increase of 
the company discontinued its xls reduction stepper platform in september and has since suspended development of its advanced reduction lithography systems 
however  the company was able to sell three systems which had been previously written down during the year ended december  the weighted average selling prices of systems sold  exclusive of reduction systems  increased due primarily to a lower proportion of refurbished systems sold in in  refurbished systems accounted for approximately of units sold as compared to of units sold in this percentage fluctuates from year to year and any such fluctuation would have an impact on the weighted average selling price of the systems sold 
on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry  primarily for advanced packaging applications  were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with system sales of million in system sales to the semiconductor industry included million and million of reduction stepper systems  which have been discontinued  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is due to increased purchases by the semiconductor industry as demand for products with advanced packaging capabilities has increased  particularly in the bump technology area during in  the company believes that the semiconductor industry will continue to recover resulting in increased equipment purchases and that the company is positioned to grow as the utilization of advanced packaging in the semiconductor industry increases 
system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with sales of million in  primarily as a result of growth in the laser diode and led markets and improvements in the disk drive industry 
spare part sales for increased  to million  as compared to this increase is due to increased levels of manufacturing within the semiconductor industry  resulting in greater utilization of the equipment  and an increase in upgrades of customer systems 
revenues from services declined  to million  primarily as a result of fewer units coming out of warranty during the year partially offset by increased revenue from training courses offered by the company of million 
revenues from licensing and licensing support arrangements declined to million  as compared with million in  as a result of a large technology support agreement that expired in february the company presently anticipates that revenues from licensing and licensing support arrangements will remain at approximately million per quarter for at december   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue resulting from products shipped but not yet installed and accepted and deferred service revenue  as compared with million at december  the decrease in deferred revenue resulted from lower shipments of systems not yet installed and accepted as compared to systems recognized for revenue in the fourth fiscal quarter of during  deferred license income decreased by million  to million  as a result of amortization of proceeds received in prior periods 
amortization of license income results in current period license revenue 
deferred income related to the company s products is recognized upon satisfying the contractual obligations for installation and or customer acceptance 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales for the company expects this trend to continue in as seven of the ten largest forecasted purchasers of semiconductor equipment are international companies 
the company s revenues in foreign countries are not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally because sales contracts for the company s systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  orders are often denominated in japanese yen 
for the year ended december   the company recorded system sales in japan of million of which were denominated in japanese yen 
this subjects the company to the risk of currency fluctuations 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the period between when an order is received and when it is recorded as revenue 
after recording revenue  the company uses various mechanisms  such as foreign currency forward exchange contracts and natural hedges  to offset substantial portions of the gains or losses associated with its japanese yen denominated receivables due to exchange rate fluctuations 
the company had approximately million of japanese yen denominated receivables at december  international sales expose the company to a number of additional risks  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar  which  in turn  impact the relative cost of ownership of the company s products 
see additional risk factors international sales 
the company believes that its served markets have strengthened during  and it expects demand for its products to grow in during the year ended december   the company s level of new orders exceeded the its revenue resulting in an increase in the company s backlog to million from million at december  however  the anticipated timing of shipments and customer acceptances will require the company to fill a number of production slots in the current and subsequent quarters in order to meet its near term sales targets 
if the company is unsuccessful in its efforts to secure those production orders  or if existing production orders are delayed or cancelled  its results of operations will be materially adversely impacted in the near term 
accordingly  the company may not be able to achieve or maintain its current or prior level of sales 
the company presently expects that net sales for the quarter ending april  will increase approximately from the level of net sales reported in the comparable period in of million 
the company expects the percentage derived from international sales in to remain consistent with the level reported for because the company s net sales are subject to a number of risks  including intense competition in the capital equipment industry  uncertainty relating to the timing and market acceptance of the company s products and the condition of the macro economy and the semiconductor industry  the company may not exceed or maintain its current or prior level of net sales for any period in the future 
additionally  the company believes that the market acceptance and volume production of its saturn spectrum e  its mm offerings  its laser processing systems and its and series family of wafer steppers  are of critical importance to its future financial results 
at december   these critical systems represented of the company s backlog 
to the extent that these products do not achieve significant sales due to difficulties involving manufacturing or engineering  the inability to reduce the current long manufacturing cycles for these products  competition  excess capacity in the semiconductor or nanotechnology device industries  customer acceptances  or any other reason  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected

excluding reduction lithography systems  which have been discontinued by the company  system sales decreased to million  on a unit volume decline of 
the weighted average selling prices of systems sold  exclusive of reduction systems  declined  due primarily to a higher proportion of refurbished systems sold in and generally weaker market conditions 
in  refurbished systems accounted for approximately of units sold 
geographically  the decline in unit volumes was attributable to or greater declines in all regions the company serves  with the steepest decline occurring in europe 
on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry were million for the year ended december   a decrease of as compared with system sales of million in system sales to the semiconductor industry included million and million of reduction stepper systems for the years ended december  and  respectively  including a single system sale of million for the quarter ended december  this decline was primarily attributable to the severely depressed economic environment in the semiconductor industry in particular  and the economy as a whole 
the company discontinued its xls reduction stepper platform in september and has since suspended development of its advanced reduction lithography systems 
system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   a decrease of as compared with sales of million in  primarily as a result of lower demand from microsystems and optical networking customers 
spare part sales decreased  to million  primarily as a result of decreased utilization of plant capacity within the semiconductor industry and certain system upgrades that occurred in revenues from services declined  to million  primarily as a result of decreased utilization of plant capacity within the semiconductor industry 
revenues from licensing and licensing support arrangements declined to million  as compared with million in  as a result of a large technology support agreement that expired in february at december   the company had approximately million of deferred revenue resulting from products shipped but not yet installed and accepted  as compared with million at december  this resulted in a net increase in deferred product and services income of approximately million 
during  deferred license income decreased by million  to million  as a result of amortization of proceeds received in prior periods 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales for gross profit years ended december  expressed as a of total net sales total net sales cost of products and services sold cost recovery of inventory writedown cost recovery of discontinued products gross margin vs 
during  the company reported the benefit of selling inventory and discontinued products previously written down of million and million  respectively 
this contrasts to charges for those items in of million and million  respectively 
the company presently records write downs to reflect the reduction in carrying value for inventories and purchase order commitments in excess of months of production demand months for certain long lead time items 
based on the company s current expectations with respect to market demand for its products  gross margin may be favorably impacted by similar recoveries in on a comparative basis  gross margins  exclusive of the aforementioned recoveries and charges were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company believes disclosure of gross margins exclusive of these recoveries and charges provides additional appropriate disclosure to allow comparison of its gross margins over time 
the percentage point improvement in gross margin in was due primarily to improved service and warranty costs points  resulting from improved product quality and better utilization of the company s personnel  increased production levels points  resulting from better utilization of the company s manufacturing infrastructure  and lower manufacturing costs points  of which million was due to the recording of an expense in related to prior periods due to rent averaging requirements under certain of the company s facility leases 
these improvements were offset partially by the impact of lower licensing revenue points  which has no associated cost of sales  and a change in product mix 
exclusive of licensing and licensing support revenues  gross margin was for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december   inclusive of the aforementioned recoveries and charges 
the company believes disclosure of gross margins without reference to licensing and licensing support revenues provides additional appropriate disclosure to allow comparison of its product gross margins over time 
the company s gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and most likely will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products sold  writedowns of inventory and open purchase commitments  the rate of capacity utilization  product discounts  pricing and competition in the company s targeted markets  technology support and licensing revenues  which have no associated cost of sales  non linearity of shipments during the quarter which can result in manufacturing inefficiencies  the introduction of new products  which typically have higher manufacturing costs until manufacturing efficiencies are realized and which are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance  the percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins than domestic sales principally due to higher field service and support costs  and start up costs and inefficiencies associated with the implementation of subcontracting arrangements 
the company believes that gross margin for the quarter ending april  will improve significantly to between and  as compared to the comparable period in which was  primarily due to increased revenues 
should erosion of the company s business occur  the company might incur a higher risk of inventory obsolescence and excess purchase commitments  which would materially adversely impact results of operations 
additionally  increased price based competition would contribute to erosion of gross margin 
new products generally have lower gross margins until there is widespread market acceptance and until production and after sales efficiencies can be achieved 
should significant market demand fail to develop for the company s laser processing systems  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
vs 
the company s gross margin  was for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december   inclusive of charges for the cost of inventory writedowns of million for the year ended december   and the cost of discontinued products of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on a comparative basis  gross margins  exclusive of the aforementioned charges  were adversely affected by the lack of capacity utilization 
lack of capacity utilization results in higher levels of unabsorbed overhead 
this adverse impact on gross margins from these lower production levels was partially offset by cost savings associated with the closing of the company s wilmington  massachusetts facility and by other cost reduction measures taken in the second half of gross margins for the quarter ended december  were adversely impacted by recording million of non cash expenses related to prior periods  pursuant to rent averaging requirements under certain of the company s facility leases 
the company does not believe these amounts are material to the periods in which they should have been recorded  nor does it believe the prospective correction of such amounts during the year ended december  is material to its consolidated operating results for such year 
exclusive of licensing and licensing support revenues  gross margin was for the year ended december   as compared with for the year ended december   inclusive of the aforementioned charges 
the company believes disclosure of gross margins without reference to licensing and licensing support revenues provides additional appropriate disclosure to allow comparison of its product gross margins over time 
in september  as a direct result of worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry in particular  and the general economy as a whole  the company discontinued or suspended development of certain advanced reduction lithography programs  including nm  and discontinued certain x products and platforms 
additionally  the company significantly reduced its revenue outlook for as a result  the company recognized inventory write downs of million and additional purchase order commitment reserves of million for the year ended december  in the three month period ended september   as a direct result of dramatically worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry  the company decided to discontinue its xls reduction stepper production and focus its efforts on developing next generation platforms for its reduction technologies  principally nm 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized inventory write downs of million and additional purchase order commitment reserves of million 
research  development and engineering expenses vs 
in millions amount of change percentage change research  development and engineering expenses the million year over year decline in research  development and engineering spending was primarily attributable to the restructuring of the applications engineering function in september million  the discontinuance of the company s advanced reduction stepper platforms in the second half of million and the impact of recording a million non cash expense related to prior periods  pursuant to rent averaging requirements under certain of the company s facility leases 
these favorable impacts were offset partially by increased spending on the company s laser processing technologies and its next generation x stepper products 
the company continues to invest significant resources in the development and enhancement of its laser processing systems and technologies and its x products and related technologies 
the company presently expects that the absolute dollar amount of research  development and engineering expenses for the quarter ending april  will be approximately higher than expenses incurred for the comparable period in of million

amortization of intangible assets was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for the year ended december  the year over year reduction in amortization was a direct result of impairment charges recognized in the quarter ended september  relating to certain intangible assets see restructure of operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses vs 
in millions amount of change percentage change selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased to  as compared with in the year over year decline  in absolute dollars  was primarily attributable to cost containment measures implemented in the second half of million and reduced legal costs million  partially offset by higher selling expenses associated with a increase in the company s revenue million and increased corporate governance costs primarily associated with the company s compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec and nasdaq rules million 
the company presently anticipates that selling  general and administrative expenses for the three month period ending april  will be approximately higher than the million reported in the comparable period in  due primarily to increased selling costs associated with the expected increase in net sales  costs associated with bringing its laser processing product to market and costs associated with compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec and nasdaq rules

selling  general  and administrative expenses for the quarter ended december  were adversely impacted by recording million of non cash expenses related to prior periods  pursuant to rent averaging requirements under certain of the company s facility leases 
the company does not believe these amounts are material to the periods in which they should have been recorded  nor does it believe the prospective correction of such amounts during the year ended december  is material to its consolidated operating results for such year 
restructure of operations in september  in response to suddenly worsening conditions in the semiconductor industry in particular  and the general economy as a whole  the company decided to reduce its workforce by approximately and to cease or suspend activities related to certain engineering and administrative initiatives 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized a restructuring charge of million  or per share for the three month period ended september  the company reduced this charge by million during the three month period ended december   primarily as a result of canceling its plans to exit a certain building and an adjustment of its international severance costs 
of the total net charge for the year ended december  of million  the cash component included employee severance costs of million  contract termination fees of million and facility closure costs of million 
the non cash component of this charge included million of impairment to the carrying value of equipment and leasehold improvements and million of impairment to prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the company further reduced this charge by million during the three month period ending june   as a result of a gain recorded from the sale of certain fixed assets previously written down 
as of december   all restructuring costs had been paid 
in september  the company reached a decision to consolidate its manufacturing operations and eliminate approximately of its workforce 
as a result of this decision  the company recognized a restructuring charge of million  or per share diluted in the quarter ended september  additionally  the company recognized restructuring charges of million  or per share diluted in the quarter ended december   primarily related to employee severance costs of million from additional personnel actions and higher fixed asset disposal costs of million  partially offset by revised facility closure and other cost estimates of million 
of the full year charge of million  non cash components included a million impairment charge for intangible assets related to the company s xls reduction product platform acquired in and a million impairment charge for fixed assets disposed of in conjunction with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities 
the cash components of this charge included million for estimated expenditures related to the closure of facilities  million for employee severance costs and million of other restructuring costs 
in october  the company reached an agreement to terminate its lease for a facility in wilmington  massachusetts 
as a result of this agreement the company recorded a recovery of restructuring charges of million during the period ending december  as of december   all restructuring costs had been paid

interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  which consists primarily of interest income  was million for the year ended december   as compared with million for and million for included in the amounts reported for and were and million  respectively  relating to interest on tax settlements or refunds 
the decrease in from was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on the company s investments 
the decrease in relative to was primarily attributable to lower interest rates on the company s investments and lower average invested balances 
the company presently maintains an investment portfolio with a weighted average maturity of less than one year 
consequently  changes in short term interest rates have a major impact on the company s interest income 
future changes are expected to have a similar impact 
the company presently expects that interest and other income  net  for the three month period ending april   will be approximately lower than the million reported in the comparable period in  primarily as a result of lower interest rates 
income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit of million  inclusive of a special tax benefit of million related to the settlement of a research and development tax credit claim with the california franchise tax board and million related to the resolution of certain tax audit issues in the united kingdom 
additionally  the company recorded a million benefit from the reversal of reserves associated with deferred tax assets carried on the balance sheet of its japan subsidiary  reflecting improved operating trends in that region 
offsetting these tax benefits was a tax expense of approximately million related  primarily  to taxable income in the company s foreign entities  for which there is no corresponding net operating loss carry forward benefit 
for the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit of million 
the benefit relates to resolution of the company s irs audit for the years through and a carry back of losses to recover prior years federal alternative minimum taxes of million 
the company presently anticipates that it will recognize income tax expense in of approximately of pre tax income  primarily as a result of foreign income taxes and federal alternative minimum tax 
the company believes that the tax rate in will be substantially less than the statutory rate because of available federal net operating loss carry forwards 
the company expects to recognize the benefit of the use of these carryforwards by reversing the valuation allowance associated with the company s domestic deferred tax assets 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether  and within which jurisdictions  future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with the company s tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and it does not anticipate any material earnings impact from their ultimate resolutions 
liquidity and capital resources net cash generated by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared with net cash used in operations of million for the comparable period in net cash generated by operating activities during the year ended december  was attributable to net income of million and non cash charges to income of million  partially offset by the use of cash resulting from a net change in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the million use of cash from the net change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily a result of a decrease in deferred product and services income of million due to the low level of systems shipped as compared to revenue in the three month period ended december   a decrease in deferred license income of million  liquidation of accruals related to restructurings of million  an increase in long term demonstration inventories of million and a use of cash of million due to changes in all other assets and liabilities 
these uses were offset partially by reductions in inventory of million  as a result of improved sales during and focused efforts to improve inventory utilization  and accounts receivable of million due to low levels of system shipments in the three month period ending december  the company expects the decrease in accounts receivable and deferred product and services income to be temporary as system unit shipments in the period ending april  are expected to increase significantly as compared to system unit shipments in the quarter ended december   although the increases in deferred product and services income may be more gradual over additionally  the company expects to increase long term demonstration inventory to include its new laser processing product offerings 
the company believes that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of its systems  particularly newer products  the company s inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
currently  the company is devoting significant resources to the development  introduction and commercialization of its laser processing system and to the development of its next generation x lithography technologies 
the company currently intends to continue to incur significant operating expenses in the areas of research  development and engineering  manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs in order to further develop  produce and support these new products

these costs include  but are not limited to  additional manufacturing overhead  costs of demonstration systems and facilities and the establishment of additional after sales support organizations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that operating expenses will not increase  relative to sales  as a result of adding additional marketing and administrative personnel  among other costs  to support the company s new products 
if the company is unable to achieve significantly increased net sales or if its sales fall below expectations  the company s cash flow and operating results will be materially adversely affected until  among other factors  costs and expenses can be reduced 
the failure of the company to achieve its sales targets for these new products could result in additional inventory write offs and asset impairment charges  either of which could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations

the company records writedowns for purchase order commitments it deems in excess of normal operating requirements see critical accounting policies and estimates 
the development and manufacture of new lithography systems and enhancements are highly capital intensive 
in order to be competitive  the company believes it must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  sales  service  training and support capabilities  systems  procedures and controls  and expansion of operations and research and development  among many other items 
the company expects that cash generated from operations and its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  in the near term  the company may continue to utilize existing and future lines of credit  and other sources of financing  in order to maintain its present levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
beyond the next twelve months  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to address its working capital or capital equipment needs 
in addition  the company may seek to raise equity or debt capital at any time that it deems market conditions to be favorable 
additional financing  if needed  may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
the company may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
future acquisitions by the company may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations

other than liabilities recorded pursuant to known product defects  at december   the company did not record a liability associated with these guarantees  as the company has little or no history of costs associated with such indemnification requirements 
foreign currency as part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company attempts to hedge most of its japanese yen denominated foreign currency exposures 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that unremitted japanese yen denominated receipts from customers for actual or forecasted sales of equipment after receipt of customer orders may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   the company had taken action to hedge approximately of these japanese yen denominated exposures 
to hedge this exposure  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of nine months or less 
the company often closes foreign currency forward contracts by entering into an offsetting contract

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk due to potential changes in interest rates  relates primarily to the company s investment portfolio  which consisted primarily of fixed interest rate instruments as of december  the company maintains an investment policy designed to ensure the safety and preservation of its invested funds by limiting market risk and the risk of default 
certain of the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments serve as collateral for a line of credit the company maintains with a brokerage firm 
the line of credit is used for liquidity purposes  mitigating the need to liquidate investments in order to meet the company s current operating cash requirements 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held by the company at december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these instruments are comprised of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
these instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling techniques used measure the change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in interest rates 
assumed market value changes to the company s portfolio reflects immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps 
valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points no change in interest rate valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points short term investments  in thousands bps bps bps bps bps bps bps us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies obligations of states and political subdivisions us corporate debt securities total short term investments the company has not materially altered its investment objectives or criteria and believes that  although the composition of the company s portfolio has changed from the preceding year  the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is materially the same 
credit risk the company mitigates credit default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by positioning its portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and is diversified in accordance with the company s investment policy 
to date  the company has not experienced significant liquidity problems with its portfolio 
foreign exchange risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  the company does enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates the company has established transaction and balance sheet hedging programs 
the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that unremitted japanese yen denominated receipts from customers for actual or forecasted sales of equipment after receipt of customer orders may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   the company had taken action to hedge approximately of these japanese yen denominated exposures 
to hedge this exposure  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of nine months or less 
the company often closes foreign currency forward contracts by entering into an offsetting contract 
at december   the company had contracts for the sale and purchase of and million  respectively  of foreign currencies at fixed rates of exchange 
the company s hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency movements
