item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
the results of operations and financial condition of the company  as reflected in the accompanying statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of the company s tenants 
executive overview wri focuses on increasing funds from operations and dividend payments to the company s common shareholders through hands on leasing and management of the existing portfolio of properties and through disciplined growth from selective acquisitions and new developments 
the company is also committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 
at december   wri owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through its interest in joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties located in states that span the southern half of the united states from coast to coast 
included in the portfolio are shopping centers and industrial properties 
wri has approximately  leases and  different tenants 
leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
leases generally include minimum lease payments which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
the stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
in assessing the performance of the company s properties  management carefully tracks the occupancy of the company s portfolio 
occupancy for the total portfolio was as of year end compared to as of year end another important indicator of performance is the spread in rental rates on a same space basis as we complete new leases and renew existing leases 
in  wri completed  new leases or renewals for the year totaling million square feet  increasing rental rates an average of on a same space basis 
net of capital costs  the average increase in rental rates was 
with respect to external growth through acquisitions and new developments  management closely monitors movements in returns in relation to its blended weighted average cost of capital  the amount of product in its acquisition and new development pipelines and the geographic areas in which opportunities are present 
the company purchased shopping centers and five industrial properties during  comprising million square feet  and representing a total investment of million 
these purchases included six properties in florida  four each in georgia and texas  two in california  one each in colorado  illinois and north carolina  and two in the state of utah 
utah represents the th state in which wri operates  and was a logical expansion given wri s geographic footprint in the southern part of the united states from coast to coast 
with respect to new development  wri completed projects during totaling million square feet  representing an investment of million 
as with acquisitions  management closely monitors returns on new opportunities as well as performance against underwritten returns on projects under development 
projects completed in are leased 
wri also has shopping centers in various stages of development in arizona  colorado  louisiana  nevada  texas and utah  and the company anticipates that the majority of them will come on line during page continuing its strategy of selling assets that no longer meet its ownership criteria  the company disposed of eight properties during the year 
these property sales represented a total of  square feet and provided proceeds of million  generating a gain of million  which includes 
million from an unconsolidated joint venture 
management is also committed to maintaining a strong  conservative capital structure  which provides constant access to a variety of capital sources 
the strength of wri s balance sheet is evidenced by unsecured debt ratings of a by standard and poor s and a by moody s rating services  the highest combined ratings of any public reit 
the company carefully balances obtaining low cost financing with minimizing exposure to interest rate movements  matching long term liabilities with the long term assets acquired or developed and maintaining adequate debt to market capitalization  fixed charge coverage and other ratios as necessary to retain our current credit ratings 
in executing this strategy  the company redeemed its series a and b cumulative redeemable preferred shares during the year through issuance of million of depositary shares  each representing one thirtieth of a series d cumulative redeemable preferred share  and million common shares of beneficial interest  respectively 
the company also issued million of unsecured fixed rate medium term notes during the year with a weighted average rate of and a weighted average term of years 
with respect to future trends  management expects continued improvement in the performance of the existing portfolio through increased occupancy and rental rate increases as the economy trends upward 
with respect to external growth  we have already closed seven acquisitions totaling million in and have nearly million of properties in the pipeline 
each of these potential acquisitions is still subject to a stringent due diligence process and  therefore  there is no assurance that any or all will be purchased 
management anticipates an increase in interest rates over the course of in managing this risk and maintaining adequate capacity to fund external growth  the company has issued million of ten year unsecured fixed rate medium term notes with a weighted average interest rate  net of the effect of related swaps  of thus far in summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of receivables an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical bad debt levels  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends 
balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to the straight lining of rental commitments 
additionally  estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy is considered in assessing the collectibility of the related receivables 
property real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  which  in the opinion of management  is not in excess of the individual property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from disposition 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and years for parking lot surfacing and equipment 
major replacements where the betterment extends the useful life of the asset are capitalized and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
all other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  acquired page out of market and in place leases  and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities  and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments 
the company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and specific market economic conditions that may affect the property 
property also includes costs incurred in the development of new operating properties 
these costs include preacquisition costs directly identifiable with the specific project  development and construction costs  interest and real estate taxes 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits  travel and other related costs that are clearly attributable to the development of the property  are also capitalized 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the completion of major construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
wri s properties are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
such carrying amount would be adjusted  if necessary  to estimated fair value to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset

 wri reported its property dispositions in this caption 
page funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in addition  nareit recommends that extraordinary items not be considered in arriving at ffo 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
we believe ffo is an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because it helps investors compare the operating performance of our company relative to other reits 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by wri is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
funds from operations is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders 














   depreciation and amortization 





















   depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures 





   gain on sale of properties 























   gain on sale of properties of unconsolidated joint ventures

   effects of inflation the rate of inflation was relatively unchanged in wri has structured its leases  however  in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby wri receives increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of wri s leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allows wri to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of wri s leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon wri s operating results 
page capital resources and liquidity wri anticipates that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements 
cash on hand  internally generated cash flow  borrowings under our existing credit facilities  issuance of secured and unsecured debt  as well as other debt and equity alternatives  should provide the necessary capital to maintain and operate our properties  refinance debt maturities and achieve planned growth  which are wri s primary liquidity needs 
investing activities acquisitions during  wri invested million in the acquisition of operating properties of which million was invested in shopping centers and million was invested in industrial properties 
additionally  we acquired a retail property through an investment of million in a owned unconsolidated joint venture 
we acquired shopping centers adding million square feet and five industrial properties adding million square feet to our portfolio 
non recourse secured debt totaling million  of which million is held by joint ventures or partnerships in which we participate  was assumed in conjunction with these purchases 
additionally  operating partnership units valued at million were issued in conjunction with the purchase of three properties that used the downreit structure 
the cash requirements for all acquisitions in were initially financed under wri s revolving credit facilities  funded with excess cash flow from our existing portfolio of properties or with proceeds from property dispositions 
investing activities new development and capital expenditures with respect to new development  wri completed projects during totaling million square feet  representing an investment of million 
as of december   wri has retail developments underway in which we invested million during and expect to invest million in upon completion  these projects will represent a total investment of approximately million and will add  square feet to the portfolio 
these projects will come on line during all new development in was initially financed under wri s revolving credit facilities  funded with excess cash flow from our existing portfolio of properties or with proceeds from property dispositions 
capital expenditures for additions to the existing portfolio  acquisitions  and new development totaled million in and million in wri s share of capital expenditures for unconsolidated joint ventures or partnerships  including the purchase and development of properties by newly formed joint ventures or partnerships was million in and million in financing activities debt total debt outstanding increased to billion at december  from billion at december   due primarily to funding of acquisitions and new development 
total debt at december  includes billion on which interest rates are fixed  including the net effect of our million of interest rate swaps  and million which bears interest at variable rates 
additionally  debt totaling million is secured by operating properties while the remaining billion is unsecured 
in november  wri closed on an amended and restated credit agreement for a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the facility bears an interest rate of libor plus basis points 
additionally  the facility includes a competitive bid option that allows wri to hold auctions at lower pricing for short term funds for up to million and an accordion feature  which can increase the facility amount up to million at our option 
wri used million under this facility to retire in full its outstanding obligations under a million unsecured revolving credit facility and a million unsecured term loan  both of which matured in november as of december   wri is in full compliance with the amended and restated credit agreement currently in place 
wri also has an unsecured and uncommitted overnight credit facility totaling million to be used for cash management purposes 
during the year ended december   wri issued a total of million of unsecured fixed rate medium term notes with a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average term of years 
subsequent to year end  wri issued a total of million of ten year unsecured fixed rate medium term notes with a weighted average rate of  including the effect of related swap transactions discussed below 
proceeds received from both the and medium term note issuances were used to pay down amounts outstanding under our page revolving credit facilities 
in addition  a million floating rate medium term note matured in july  and a million fixed rate medium term note matured in december wri hedges the future cash flows of its debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of its debt instruments  principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions 
as of december   we have two interest rate swap contracts  which fix interest rates at on an aggregate notional amount of million and expire in june we have determined that these swap contracts are highly effective in offsetting future variable interest cash flows of the revolving credit debt and  accordingly  they have been designated as cash flow hedges with a fair value  net of accrued interest  of 
million at december  and are included in other liabilities 
also  we have ten interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million at december  that convert fixed interest payments at rates ranging from to to variable interest payments 
these contracts have been designated as fair value hedges 
we have determined that they are highly effective in limiting our risk of changes in the fair value of the fixed rate notes attributable to changes in variable interest rates 
the fair value of these ten interest rate swaps  net of accrued interest  at december  was million and is included in other assets 
in december  we entered into two forward starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate medium term notes subsequent to year end 
these contracts were designated as a cash flow hedge of forecasted interest payments for million of unsecured notes with a coupon of that were sold in february concurrent with the sale of the notes  we settled our million forward starting interest rate swap contracts  resulting in a loss of 
million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
this 
million loss is being amortized to earnings over the life of the notes 
in january  we entered into four additional forward starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate medium term notes before april medium term notes totaling million were issued in january  at which time one of the four forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million was settled at a loss of 
million 
in conjunction with acquisitions completed during  we assumed million of non recourse debt secured by the related properties 
the weighted average interest rate on this debt is  and the weighted average remaining life is years 
additionally  we assumed non recourse debt secured by three properties that are held by joint ventures or partnerships in which we participate 
our share of this debt totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of and a weighted average remaining life of years 
in december  million of series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares were redeemed from the proceeds of the common share offerings in the fourth quarter of financing activities equity common and preferred dividends increased to million in  compared to million in and million in wri satisfied its reit requirement of distributing at least of ordinary taxable income for each of the three years ending december  our dividend payout ratio on common equity for  and approximated  and  respectively  based on funds from operations for the applicable year 
in april  the sec declared effective wri s billion shelf registration statement  of which million was available as of march  wri will continue to closely monitor both the debt and equity markets and carefully consider its available financing alternatives  including both public and private placements 
with respect to its preferred shares  wri has engaged in the following transactions in april  the company issued million of depositary shares 
each depositary share represents one thirtieth of a series d cumulative redeemable preferred share at a redemption price of per depositary share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon 
the depositary shares are not convertible or exchangeable for any other property or securities of wri and are classified as equity at december  the series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares were redeemed in may with proceeds from the april issuance of million of depositary shares 
the original issuance costs of million for the series a shares were reported as a deduction in arriving at net income available to common shareholders 
page the series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares were redeemed in december with proceeds from common share offerings in the fourth quarter of due to the adoption of sfas no

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin establishes new disclosure and liability recognition requirements for direct and indirect debt guarantees with page specified characteristics 
the initial measurement and recognition requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on wri s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this statement provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted this statement effective january  using the prospective method  which requires us to recognize stock based employee compensation as an expense when new share options are awarded  and determined that the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
in january  fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin  as amended  requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate  but in which it has a significant variable interest other than a majority voting interest 
wri has assessed its joint ventures and believes that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which was effective for the first interim period beginning after june  sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments that incorporate an obligation by the issuer to transfer assets or issue equity be reported as liabilities 
financial instruments that fall within the scope of sfas no 
include equity shares and non controlling interests in subsidiaries that are mandatorily redeemable 
wri s series b and series c cumulative redeemable preferred shares fall within the scope of sfas no 
 since they are mandatorily redeemable and redemption is through transfer of cash or a variable number of wri common shares 
accordingly  we reclassified the redemption value  net of unamortized issuance costs of million  from equity to liabilities identified as preferred shares subject to mandatory redemption as of september  forward looking statements this annual report includes certain forward looking statements reflecting wri s expectations in the near term that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  however  many factors may materially affect the actual results  including demand for our properties  changes in rental and occupancy rates  changes in property operating costs  interest rate fluctuations  and changes in local and general economic conditions 
accordingly  there is no assurance that wri s expectations will be realized 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wri uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance its capital requirements 
these transactions expose wri to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose wri to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   wri had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the effect of interest rate swaps 
we also had variable rate notes receivable from joint venture partners totaling million at year end 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  net income  funds from operations and future cash flows would decrease million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december  page
