item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in august  we changed our fiscal year end from october to december effective as of january   with the two months ended december  being the transition period 
we filed an amendment to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october  on november  to restate our consolidated financial statements as of october  and and for the three years ended october  to reflect the discontinued operations of our petrotech operation and the realignment of our operations into four new segments 
overview we are a diversified industrial company that designs  manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls  scientific and industrial imaging products and software  industrial technology products and instrumentation products and services 
we market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including water and wastewater  oil and gas  research  power generation  medical  semiconductor  refrigeration  automotive  and general industry 
we pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses 
our acquisitions have represented both financial bolt ons and new strategic platforms 
we strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments 
on december   we acquired ntgh  comprising neptune technology  a leader in the meter management market  dap technologies  a leading fully rugged computer provider  and db microware  providing various software products for utility markets 
as these businesses were closed for the year end holiday period following the acquisition there are no operating results attributable to these operations in our fiscal results 
however  the assets and liabilities of the operations are consolidated in our balance sheet as of december  in connection with this acquisition we retired our existing debt  completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  entered into a new million credit agreement  and issued million of senior subordinated convertible notes 
an underwriters overallotment of  shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed in january during the fiscal year ended december   our results of operations benefited from five acquisitions made during the last six months of the fiscal year zetec  reported in our energy systems and controls segment ai qualitek  reported in our instrumentation segment qimaging  reported in our scientific and industrial imaging segment duncan technologies  reported in our scientific and industrial imaging segment definitive imaging  reported in our scientific and industrial imaging segment our largest customer is oao gazprom 
gazprom has been a customer over the past eleven years through a number of its procurement affiliates 
in late  gazprom assigned a new procurement affiliate to negotiate with us  and during the second calendar quarter of we secured a new supply agreement 
orders received under this agreement have been received on a delayed basis and at lower levels than initially indicated by the procurement affiliate and consequently have resulted in lower activity levels than in comparative prior year periods 
new orders received under this agreement during the year ended december  totaled million or of total new orders 
net sales to gazprom were million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended october  during the transition period ended december   we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure 
this structure has realigned our operations into four market focused groups to capture value creating opportunities around common customers  market orientation  sales channels and common cost opportunities 
having recruited and reassigned new managers to lead these realigned groups in the first quarter  we commenced cascading leadership through these segments with the hiring of several key managers from established growth companies to provide enhanced functional and business expertise 
following the segment realignment  we started a number of restructuring activities 
we have completed the integration of our acton research and integrated design business units  the integration of ai qualitek into the uson business unit and the integration of production operations of our redlake business unit into other imaging segment facilities 
in addition  we have opened a new production facility in mexico as a result of which we closed the us production operations of the dynamco business unit and commenced the movement of manufacturing of certain other industrial technology product lines into this facility 
we opened a new production facility in china to better serve customers in that growing market 
during the third quarter  we completed our relocation of struers manufacturing  engineering and administrative support activities into a new facility 
final actions to be completed in the first half of include the move of the us production operations of the amot controls business unit to other facilities and a restructuring of the compressor controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of gazprom business 
all of these actions are planned to lower costs and enhance margins 
in february  we launched a new motion imaging product line in our scientific and industrial imaging segment 
extensive development of this product line commenced during the second quarter of fiscal and was completed during february during the development period our customers deferred ordering our existing products in anticipation of significant benefits from our new technology cameras and systems 
the weakening of the us dollar during fiscal  particularly against the euro  the danish krone and the british pound  had a mixed impact on our reported results 
without the currency changes  reported net sales and net orders would have been reduced by million and million respectively as compared to the prior calendar year 
however  the potentially favorable effects on profits from these currency translation efforts were substantially offset by the impact of selling products in the us that we produced in countries with now increased euro denominated costs 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
a discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report 
gaap offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results  such as determining inventory cost  depreciating long lived assets  recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees 
we have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements  except for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed below 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures 
the development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management 
our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the sec 
although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable  others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available 
if an accounting estimate changes  its effects are accounted for prospectively 
our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility  inventory utilization  future warranty obligations  revenue recognition percent of completion  income taxes and goodwill analysis 
these issues  except for income taxes  which are not allocated to our business segments  affect each of our business segments 
these issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience  current conditions and relatively short term forecasting 
accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products  including in certain cases  credits for returned products 
accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms  whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences  what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers 
the returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  sales returns and sales credits was million  or of total gross accounts receivable 
this percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and has remained constant as a percent of sales as compared to the october  levels and the transition period ended december  we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage  which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
when we use historical usage  this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances 
at december   inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million  or of gross first in  first out inventory cost 
this percentage has remained constant with both the fiscal year ended october  and the transition period ended december  most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale  typically months 
future warranty obligations are evaluated using  among other factors  historical cost experience  product evolution and customer feedback 
at december   the accrual for future warranty obligations was million or of annualized fourth quarter fiscal sales 
this calculation is based upon both roper s and ntgh s annualized fourth quarter sales 
the warranty reserve for the ntgh entities is at a similar level to the existing roper entities 
our expense for warranty obligations was less than of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended december   october  and october  revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project 
during the twelve month period ended december   we recognized revenue of approximately million using this method due primarily to two of our businesses carrying out major energy and water wastewater projects of a turn key  longer term nature 
no material amount of revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended december  approximately million and million of revenue was recognized using this method during the twelve months ended october  and  respectively 
at december  approximately million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized 
contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
during fiscal  our effective income tax rate was reduced to as compared to for the two month period ended december  and for the twelve month period ended october  the primary reasons for the decline for the current fiscal year are the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings 
we are not expecting to incur in the one time costs that created this abnormally low tax rate 
we adopted sfas no 
effective november  the beginning of our fiscal year ended october  the evaluation of goodwill under sfas requires valuations of each applicable underlying business 
these valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time  market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets 
these estimates will likely change over time 
some of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality 
the transitional business valuation reviews required by sfas indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units redlake  petrotech and dynamco 
this goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended october  and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately million 
sfas requires goodwill to be evaluated annually 
if this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances  that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations 
our annual reviews undertaken during fiscal and fiscal did not indicate that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary 
our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions 
prior to adopting sfas  goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding years 
with the adoption of this standard  goodwill is not amortized 
it is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above 
sfas does not permit retroactive application to years prior to adoption 
therefore  earnings beginning in fiscal tend to be higher than earlier periods as a result of this accounting change  except for the effects of any impairment provision on current results 
note to our consolidated financial statements includes a reconciliation comparing earnings of pre adoption periods to earnings of current periods for those periods presented 
goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of sfas was largest in the instrumentation segment 
we are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment 
at december   roper s total assets included million of goodwill 
goodwill was allocated million to our instrumentation segment  million to our industrial technology segment  million to our energy systems and controls segment and million to our scientific and industrial imaging segment 
total goodwill was allocated to different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than million to approximately million

restructuring charges were   and  in industrial technology  instrumentation  and scientific and industrial imaging  respectively 
restructuring charges in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements in compliance with sfas  are included as a reduction of operating profits in the respective segments 
year ended december  compared to year ended october  net sales for the twelve months ended december  were million as compared to sales of million for the twelve months ended october   an increase of 
a significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal acquisitions  zetec  ai qualitek and qimaging 
we had a significant decrease in sales to gazprom million or decline from the prior period as a result of the change in their procurement processes noted previously 
this significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and consumables  imaging sales into electron microscopy markets  water wastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales 
in our instrumentation segment  net sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or over the twelve months ended october  the increase was attributable to the full year impact of ai qualitek acquired in fiscal and strong results from our european based struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets 
net sales for our industrial technology segment increased by million or for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended october  the increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger municipal water wastewater projects 
in our energy systems and controls segment  net sales for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or over the twelve months ended october  the increase was due to the full year impact of zetec acquired in fiscal  offset by the expected lower sales levels to gazprom 
we also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of million or for the twelve months ended december  over the twelve months ended october  the increase was attributable to both the full year impact of qimaging acquired in fiscal and the increased sales for electron microscopy products 
our overall gross profit percentage was for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the twelve months ended october  instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat period over period at as compared to 
industrial technology gross margins decreased to due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls business that is being addressed by moving production to lower cost environments 
our energy systems and controls segment reported margins of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal a decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of zetec whose gross margins are lower than the segment average 
additionally there were lower margins from the significantly lower levels of gazprom sales in this segment in the current period 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment gross margins were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to of net sales for the twelve months ended december  from of net sales for the twelve months ended october   primarily from million of restructuring expenses of net sales incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity  move certain operations to lower cost locations and reduce fixed costs 
interest expense decreased million  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended october   as a result of lower debt levels in the current period 
the company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels prior to the ntgh transaction 
income taxes were of pretax earnings in fiscal compared to in fiscal the primary factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal of certain expenses related to the ntgh acquisition and related financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings 
at december   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both october  and december  this strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of million in the two month period ending december  and of million in the twelve month period ending december  approximately million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows 
fiscal operating results also benefited from the stronger non us currencies 
the net benefits were approximately of operating earnings 
foreign exchange differences related to our other non us subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal financial performance 
the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended december  and october  dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   total   instrumentation segment net orders improved due to the full year bookings of ai qualitek  continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment 
industrial technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft fiscal energy systems and controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of zetec orders and strength in non gazprom oil and gas sectors  offset by significantly lower gazprom orders 
scientific and industrial imaging net orders benefited from the full year of qimaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products sales increased in the period and weaker research market demand for high end digital cameras 
the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at december  and october  dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   total   the increase in backlog was primarily due to the inclusion of the ntgh entities at december  the decline in the instrumentation segment backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications business 
two months ended december  compared to two months ended december  net sales for the two month period ended december  were million as compared to million in the two month period ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the scientific and industrial imaging segment  partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal acquisitions 
in our instrumentation segment  net sales decreased by as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for our logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semi conductor market 
elsewhere softness in oil gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the ai qualitek acquisition 
gross margins moved from in the prior year period to in the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our logitech unit and semi conductor businesses 
sg a expenses as a percentage of sales were higher at due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures 
overall the segment reported operating profit margins of as compared to in the prior year period 
in our industrial technology segment  net sales were comparable to the same period in gross margins decreased to in the period from in the prior year  however  sg a expenses as a percentage of sales were lower at offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain constant at 
the lower sg a expense level is primarily the result of headcount reductions 
net sales in our energy systems controls segment increased by during the two months ended december  as sales contributed by zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to gazprom 
gross margins decreased from to as a result of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season 
this adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales from in the prior year period to in the current year period 
as a result  operating losses increased from in the prior year period to 
management does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future 
our scientific industrial imaging segment net sales decreased by due primarily to the absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the contributions from the qimaging and definitive imaging acquisitions 
gross margins decreased from in to due to the increased manufacturing costs in the period for tem imaging equipment 
sg a expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in the period from in the prior year period as a result of additional costs associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated with foreign sales subsidiaries 
overall  the segment reported operating profits margins of as compared to with the bulk of the decline attributable to the repositioning of our motion imaging business 
corporate expenses decreased by million and reduced as a percentage of sales from to due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs 
interest expense held constant at million for the two month period ended december  compared to the two month period ended december   as lower effective interest rates offset increased borrowing levels 
other income was million in the two month period ended december  as compared to million in the equivalent prior year period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains 
income taxes were of pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to in the equivalent prior year period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available foreign income tax credits 
at december   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at october  and december  this strengthening resulted in a gain of million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended december  approximately million of the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows 
operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of the us dollar  primarily against the euro 
the difference between the operating results for these companies for the two month period ending december   translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two month period and these operating results translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in was not material 
if the impact of selling european sourced product in the us is also considered  the impact of currency movements was negligible 
net orders  booked for continuing operations  were million for the period  higher than the same period of net order intake of million 
this increase was due to the additional net orders booked of million from our fiscal acquisitions  which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our industrial technology segment 
overall  our order backlog at december  increased by million as compared to december  this increase was due to new acquisitions having million in backlog at december   partially offset by softness in the industrial technology segment 
net orders booked for the two months ended december  order backlog as of december  instrumentation     industrial technology     energy systems controls     scientific industrial imaging    year ended october  compared to year ended october  net sales for fiscal were million as compared to sales of million in fiscal  an increase of 
million of the sales increase was attributable to acquisitions during fiscal zetec  qimaging  duncan technologies  definitive imaging and ai qualitek and the full year impact of acquisitions made during fiscal struers  logitech  media cybernetics and dynamco 
excluding this impact net sales declined by  to million primarily attributable to declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and gas exploration and certain industrial markets 
the impact of these difficult market conditions was somewhat mitigated by a increase in sales to gazprom and an increase in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their products help customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding sulfur content in petroleum products 
in our instrumentation segment  fiscal net sales increased by million or over fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a year on year sales increase of million from acquisitions ai qualitek acquired in fiscal and the full year impact of our fiscal acquisitions struers and logitech 
excluding this impact of acquisitions  net sales declined to million as a result of severely depressed business conditions in semiconductor markets 
net sales for our industrial technology segment declined by million or from fiscal to fiscal  primarily from weakness in industrial pump and oil gas exploration markets 
the full year impact of the fiscal acquisition of dynamco slightly mitigated this decrease 
in our energy systems and controls segment  net sales increased by million or with million of the increase being attributable to the fiscal acquisition of zetec 
excluding the impact of zetec  net sales increased to million due to gains in sales of oil gas control system applications  including those sold to gazprom 
our scientific and industrial imaging segment reported a decrease in net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal of million or 
the decrease resulted principally from lower motion product sales due to the pending release of a new generation of products that began shipping during the first quarter of fiscal fiscal acquisitions qimaging  definitive imaging and duncan technologies and the full year increase of a fiscal acquisition media cybernetics mitigated the decline by million 
excluding the impact of these acquisitions net sales declined by to million 
our overall gross profit percentage was in fiscal and the same as in fiscal instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat in fiscal at as compared to in fiscal industrial technology gross margins decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as a result of adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps businesses 
our energy systems and controls segment reported margins of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal  attributable to lower gross margins at zetec as compared to the segment average 
our scientific and industrial imaging segments gross margins were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal as margins declined for motion imaging equipment with the significant reduction in sales 
excluding the effects from the accounting changes related to goodwill and the related amortization charges expensed in fiscal of million  selling  general administrative sg a expenses increased to of net sales in fiscal from of net sales in fiscal this increase is attributable to higher sg a expense levels at newly acquired businesses 
sg a expenses for companies included in all of both and declined in despite significantly increased r d and other engineering expenses in our scientific and industrial imaging segment  most notably redlake masd 
there was also an increase in corporate sg a due primarily to an increase in medical insurance costs and salaries and related employee relocation costs 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses also increased in compared to for each of our four business segments by between and 
interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  average borrowing levels were approximately higher during fiscal compared to the prior year due to acquisitions and effective interest rates were approximately lower during fiscal compared to fiscal a euro debt foreign exchange loss of million arose from euro denominated debt that was carried in the us and the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar during the third quarter of fiscal this debt matured near july  and was replaced with us dollar denominated debt 
income taxes were of pretax earnings in fiscal compared to in fiscal two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were the change in accounting for goodwill amortization and our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits associated with european tax structures 
during fiscal  we completed a transition review for goodwill impairment under sfas as of november  this review initially compared the fair value of each previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value 
if an impairment was indicated  the amount was then determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
this impairment was reported as a change in accounting principle  was a non cash charge and was related to the redlake  petrotech and dynamco units 
at october   the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries were stronger against the us dollar compared to currency exchange rates at october  this strengthening resulted in a gain of million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal approximately million of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows 
fiscal s operating results also benefited slightly from the stronger non us currencies 
the benefits were less than of operating earnings 
foreign exchange differences related to our other non us subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal s financial information 
the following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended october dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   total   instrumentation segment net orders improved due largely to and acquisitions and higher orders for oil and gas desulfurization applications  offset somewhat by lower orders for semiconductor capital equipment markets 
industrial technology segment net orders declined on weak industrial and oil and gas exploration markets 
energy systems and controls net orders rose because of higher demand for the company s turbomachinery control systems  as well as the acquisition of zetec  with the year to year comparison adversely affected by a million supplemental order from gazprom in scientific and industrial imaging net orders fell as the benefit from and acquisitions was more than offset by weak semiconductor markets and lower motion imaging product activity 
the following table summarizes sales order backlog information at october dollar amounts in thousands 
change instrumentation   industrial technology   energy systems and controls   scientific and industrial imaging   total   a significant impact on the decreased sales order backlog at october  compared to october  was the million residual one time supplemental gazprom order which is included in the prior year backlog for energy systems and controls 
excluding this order  total company backlog increased from million to million 
declines in instrumentation and industrial technology were attributable to weak semiconductor and oil exploration markets  respectively 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the twelve months ended december   million for the twelve months ended october  and million for the twelve months ended october  excluding the one time write off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the company of million  net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  an increase of million over fiscal this increase reflected stronger earnings from operations and reduced inventories 
most of the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was attributed to the one time supplemental order for gazprom  partially offset by improved cash generation from assets 
we expect our net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal to be higher than the levels experienced in the prior three fiscal years due to the ntgh acquisition completed on december  cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal   and were primarily business acquisition costs 
cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely the borrowing activities associated with the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other net positive cash flows 
financing activities in fiscal also included replacing our existing million credit agreement and million senior notes with our current million credit agreement and million senior subordinated convertible notes 
net working capital current assets  excluding cash  less total current liabilities  excluding debt was million at december  compared to million at october  we acquired approximately million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal total debt was million at december  of total capital compared to million at october  of total capital 
our increased debt at december  compared to october  was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current fiscal year to fund the ntgh acquisition and replace the previous credit agreement and senior notes 
our principal million credit facility with a group of banks and our million senior subordinated convertible notes will provide most of our daily external financing requirements 
the credit facility consists of a million term loan with a five year maturity and a million revolving loan with a three year maturity 
our senior subordinated convertible notes are due in at december   our debt consisted of the million in senior subordinated convertible notes  a million term loan and million drawn against the revolver 
the company also had million of outstanding letters of credit at december  we expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions 
additionally  on january  we received approximately million from the exercise of the underwriters overallotment in connection with our public offering of common shares 
we also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non us businesses 
in total  these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended december  capital expenditures of million  million and million were incurred during fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be slightly higher as a percentage of sales due to the current higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired neptune technology business 
in november  roper s board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our outstanding common stock to per share from per share  an increase of 
this represents the eleventh consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since roper s initial public offering 
our board of directors has declared a dividend payable on january  payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors 
description of certain indebtedness new senior secured credit facility concurrently with the closing of the ntgh acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in december  we entered into a new million senior secured credit facility 
the new credit facility consists of a five year million term loan and a three year million revolving loan 
our new credit facility requires us to prepay our term loan and  in certain cases  reduce our commitments under our revolving loan  upon the receipt of certain proceeds  including from certain asset sales  the incurrence of certain debt  and up to of our excess cash flows  unless we meet a consolidated senior leverage ratio test 
we are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans 
the facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to incur new debt  prepay subordinated debt  make certain investments and acquisitions  sell assets and grant liens  make restricted payments including the payment of dividends on our common stock and capital expenditures  or change our line of business 
we also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio 
senior subordinated convertible notes in december  we also issued million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of  resulting in an effective yield of per year to maturity 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually  beginning july   until january  after that date  we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable 
instead  after january   interest will be recognized at the effective rate of and will represent accrual of original issue discount  excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable 
we will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after january  if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals or more of the sum of the issue price  accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest  if any  for such note 
the contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 
the notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations  rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness 
each  principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into shares of our common stock subject to adjustment  if i the sale price of our common stock reaches  or the trading price of the notes falls below  specified thresholds  ii if the notes are called for redemption or iii if specified corporate transactions have occurred 
upon conversion  we will have the right to deliver  in lieu of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and common stock 
holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on january   january   january   january   and january   at stated prices plus accrued cash interest  if any  including contingent cash interest  if any 
we may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies the following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  dollars in thousands 
contractual cash obligations payments due in fiscal total thereafter long term debt      operating leases      total      other commercial commitments amounts expiring in fiscal total amount committed thereafter standby letters of credit and bank guarantees    at december  and october   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities 
although we maintain an active acquisition program  any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities  financial condition and results of operations 
we may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources 
we anticipate that our recently acquired companies as well as our other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities  and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate 
however  the rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal and reduce the associated interest expense will be affected by  among other things  the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies  and none of these factors can be predicted with certainty

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings  and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock 
at december  we had a combination of fixed rate borrowings primarily our million senior subordinated convertible notes and relatively variable rate borrowings under the million credit facility 
our million year term note under this credit facility was variable at a spread over libor 
any borrowings under the million revolver have a fixed rate  but the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only months 
subsequent to year end  we fixed the interest rate at on million of the term note for a period of two years 
at december   there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments 
at december   roper s outstanding variable rate borrowings under the million credit facility were million 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our annualized interest costs by million 
several roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros  british pounds  danish krone or japanese yen 
sales by companies whose functional currency was not the us dollar were of our total sales and of these sales were by companies with a european functional currency 
the us dollar weakened against these european currencies during fiscal and was relatively stable compared to other currencies 
the difference between fiscal s operating results for these companies translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal and these operating results translated into us dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal was not material 
if these currency exchange rates had been different throughout fiscal compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced  the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately million 
the changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar during fiscal compared to currency exchange rates at october  resulted in an increase in net assets of million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings  million of which was attributed to goodwill 
goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows 
the trading price of roper s common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements 
the stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share 
the stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock 
we believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable
