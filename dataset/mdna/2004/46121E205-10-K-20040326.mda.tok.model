these statements are made under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those discussed in the section entitled factors that may affect future results of operations in item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
this report may include various non gaap financial measures as defined by sec regulation g  including our cash used in operations excluding costs associated with a litigation settlement and severance charges 
our management believes these measures provide useful information to investors about our financial condition and results of operations for the period presented by eliminating the affects of one time and other transactions that can distort underlying operational results in order to provide greater comparability of our financial performance on a year to year basis 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measures and reconciliation of the difference between gaap and non gaap financial measures can be found in the test of this report and our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
overview we develop  market and support a family of network intrusion prevention and detection systems and regulated information compliance systems that address vital security issues facing organizations with mission critical business applications or housing classified  confidential  or customer information assets 
we currently provide network security and regulated information compliance solutions under our securenet family of hardware and software solutions 
on june   we changed our name from ods networks  inc to intrusion 
com inc and our nasdaq ticker symbol from odsi to intz to reflect our focus on intrusion detection solutions 
on november   we changed our name from intrusion 
com  inc to intrusion inc 
during the second quarter of  we announced our plan to sell  or otherwise dispose of  our networking divisions  which included our essential communications division and our local area networking assets  and began accounting for these networking divisions as discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  maintenance contracts and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment of product 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment based on our experience 
revenue from maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the contractual period the services are performed 
to date  warranty costs and sales returns have not been material 
there is a risk that technical issues on new products could result in unexpected warranty costs and returns 
we recognize software revenue from the licensing of our software products in accordance with statement of position sop no 
software revenue recognition  sop modification of  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition whereby revenue from the licensing of our products is not recognized until all four of the following have been met i execution of a written purchase order  license agreement or contract  ii shipment of the product has occurred  iii the license fee is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we defer and recognize maintenance and support revenue over the term of the contract period  which is generally one year 
we have signed distribution agreements with distributors in the united states  europe and asia 
in general  these relationships are non exclusive 
distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
under these agreements  we provide certain protection to the distributors for their inventory of our products for price reductions as well as products that are slow moving or have been discontinued by us 
recognition of sales to distributors and related gross profits are deferred until the distributors resell the merchandise 
however  since we have legally sold the inventory to the distributor and we no longer have care  custody or control over the inventory  we recognize the trade accounts receivable and reduce inventory related to the sale at the time of shipment to the distributor 
revenue  offset by deferred cost of sales  is included in deferred revenue in the accompanying financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives be reviewed for impairment upon adoption of sfas  annually thereafter  and upon the occurrence of any event that indicates potential impairments 
in accordance with sfas  we discontinued recording goodwill amortization effective january  sfas prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for potential impairment  while the second phase if necessary measures the impairment 
goodwill is potentially impaired if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit 
this methodology differs from the company s previous policy  as permitted under accounting standards existing at that time  of using undiscounted cash flows on an enterprise wide basis to determine if goodwill is recoverable 
the company elected to perform its annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year  commencing in the fourth quarter of in connection with our annual impairment review  we determined that the value of goodwill was impaired 
at the time of our impairment review  the remaining goodwill of million was associated with the mimestar purchase transaction 
based on the decline in the market value of the company as indicated by the decline in its stock price over the last year  it was determined that the goodwill carrying value should be zero at december  therefore  an impairment charge of million was recorded and is included in impairment of intangibles in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
long lived assets effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas and accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles bulletin opinion  reporting the results of operations  for a disposal of a segment 
the primary objective of sfas is to develop one accounting model based on the framework established in sfas for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
sfas also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be displayed in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date 
our adoption of sfas had no effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
we review long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include material adverse changes in operations  significant adverse differences in actual results in comparison with initial valuation forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition  a decision to abandon acquired products  services or technologies  or other significant adverse changes that would indicate the carrying amount of the recorded asset might not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted pre tax future net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
as a result of the write off of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a triggering event indicating potential impairment of the associated intangibles had occurred 
at december   the remaining intangibles of million principally included purchased software associated with our acquisition of mimestar  inc 
we determined that the undiscounted pre tax cash flows associated with this software was not likely to exceed the remaining carrying values 
due to technological changes that had taken place with respect to the core software code acquired  it was determined that the carrying value should be zero at december  therefore  an impairment charge of million was recorded and is included in impairment of intangibles in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required

we recorded severance charges of million for severance as a result of reductions in force 
all severance obligations related to the charge were paid prior to december  and we were not receiving any benefits from those severed individuals after december  pursuant to the restructuring action discussed above and those taken in  we reduced operating expenses  excluding severance charges  litigation settlement charges  impairment charges and amortization  from million in the first quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of comparing first quarter to fourth quarter operating expense categories  sales and marketing reduced from million to million  research and development reduced from million to million and general and administrative remained constant at million per quarter throughout the year

interest income  net net interest income decreased to million in from million in primarily due to a decrease in average cash and interest bearing investment balances and lower interest rates 
we expect net interest income to decrease in compared to as we expect our average cash and interest bearing investment balances to decline for when compared to in addition  we expect interest rates to remain low  resulting in a lower return on investment

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity at december  were million of cash and cash equivalents and million of short term investments 
as of december   we do not hold investments with a stated maturity beyond one year 
working capital at december  was million compared to million as of december  net cash used in continuing operations in was million  primarily due to an operating loss for the year  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and deferred revenue  offset by depreciation  and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories 
future fluctuations in accounts receivable  inventory balances and accounts payable will be dependent upon several factors  including but not limited to quarterly sales  timely collection of accounts receivable  and the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand and component requirements 
during  our cash  cash equivalents and investments declined million from million on december  to million on december  during we continued to streamline our operations to better align our workforce with industry trends 
this realignment caused our operating expenses  excluding severance charges  litigation settlement charges  impairment charges and amortization to reduce from million in the first quarter of to million in the fourth quarter of based on our current expectations  the company will incur operating losses and further usage of cash resources during the first half of net cash provided by investing activities in was million  which consisted of the net maturity and sale of million of available for sale securities and the net purchase of property and equipment of million 
at december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
operating lease commitments of million are detailed below 
during  we funded our operations through the use of available cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in the amount of approximately million  down from approximately million as of december  however  throughout  we reduced expenses 
as a result  our cash used in operations  excluding the litigation settlement and severance charges  in the fourth quarter was approximately million 
including litigation settlement and severance charges  our cash used in operations in the fourth quarter of was million 
on march   we closed a million private placement of convertible preferred stock and warrants  the proceeds of which we intend to use for general corporate and working capital purposes 
with this additional financing  we believe that we have sufficient cash resources to finance our operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
the sufficiency of our cash resources may depend to a certain extent on general economic  financial  competitive or other factors beyond our control 
moreover  despite actions to reduce our cost and improve our profitability  we expect our operating losses and net operating cash outflows to continue through at least the first half of we do not currently have any further arrangements for financing  and we may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all  at the time when we need such funding 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and sufficient financings are not available  we may not be able to operate or grow our business  pay our expenses when due or fund our other liquidity needs 
we intend to explore the possible acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies that are complementary to our existing business 
we are continuing to identify and prioritize additional security technologies  which we may wish to develop  either internally or through the licensing or acquisition of products from third parties 
while we engage from time to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions  there can be no assurances that any such acquisitions will be made or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business 
in order to finance such acquisitions  it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
any equity or debt financings  if available at all  may be on terms  which are not favorable to us and  in the case of equity financings  may result in dilution to our stockholders 
subsequent to december   we successfully renegotiated our lease agreement for our headquarters in richardson  texas  which decreased the amount of square feet we leased and extended the lease term for an additional five years 
according to the new lease agreement  our richardson  texas headquarters will be located in the same building 
however  we will reduce the amount of space that we lease from approximately  square feet to approximately  square feet of floor space and the term of our new lease will expire in february contractual obligations the following table compares the information concerning the future contractual obligations under our operating leases based on the renegotiated lease agreement for our headquarters location 
we have no other significant contractual obligations at december  future minimum lease payments consisted of the following on december  in thousands contractual obligations at december  renegotiated contractual obligations dated back to december  and thereafter off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k
