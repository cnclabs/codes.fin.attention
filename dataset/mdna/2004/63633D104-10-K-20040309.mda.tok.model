item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the financial statements 
impaired properties include foreclosure properties in washington state  kansas and missouri 
nhi operates these properties and has included the operating revenues and expenses of these facilities in the statements of income since obtaining possession 
nhc has been retained to manage these properties 
we are treating these properties as foreclosure properties for federal income tax purposes with certain elections  unqualified income generated by the properties is expected to be treated as qualified income for up to six years from the purchase date for purposes of the income source tests that must be satisfied by reits to maintain their tax status 
remic certificate valuations on november   nhi purchased for  a participating interest in a remic in the form of nine classes of certificates issued in the aggregate principal amount of  the remic 
on december   nhi purchased for  a participating interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic in the form of one class of certificates issued in the aggregate principal amount of  the remic 
on november   nhi purchased for  a participating interest in a remic in the form of nine classes of certificates issued in the aggregate principal amount of  the remic 
both of the remics represent the entire beneficial ownership interest in a trust fund 
each trust fund consists of pools of mortgage loans  each secured by a first lien on a property that is used in providing long term nursing care and certain other assets 
pursuant to sfas  nhi has classified its investments in the certificates as held to maturity debt securities 
accordingly  the investments in the certificates have been recorded at the amortized cost in our consolidated financial statements 
the effective yields  as calculated  have been used to accrue income based on actual and projected future cash flows that reflect actual and assumed mortgage prepayments and interest rates 
remic during  we were informed by the servicer of the remic that mariner health care mariner and one of the borrowers within the remic had declared bankruptcy and was not making the required debt service payments 
as a result  we wrote off  of the remic value 
in may  mariner reached a settlement with the servicer of the remic  made payments missed in prior periods  and began making principal and interest payments in june as a result  we recognized  of interest income during at december   the net carrying value of the remic is  during  we collected  on the remic and extended the due date of the three remaining mortgages until december  we increased its carrying value by  to amortize the investment value to the amount ultimately expected to be collected in december remic at december   the net carrying value of the remic is  we have a repayment obligation of  to the servicer of the remic for amounts which the servicer has the right to recapture 
quarterly  we monitor the carrying amounts of the and remic investments based on actual cash payments received and revised cash flow projections that reflect updated assumptions about collectibility  interest rates and prepayment rates 
in the opinion of management  no other impairments of the carrying amounts have occurred as of december  loan  realty and security loss during  and  we determined  based on events occurring during those years and based on the provisions of sfas and sfas  that impairments of certain of our mortgage and real estate investments mentioned above had occurred 
these investments were affected by bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings  non receipt of payments and judgments about possible refinancing and other collateral values 
during  loan loss provisions and realty impairments of  have been recorded 
the loan loss provisions relate to  of impairments on two mortgage loans totaling  before writedowns and a working capital advance of  the realty impairment relates to a  impairment of our investment in realty of a florida facility 
it is possible that additional events could occur that would indicate a further impairment of the net carrying amount of our investments 
if such events occur  we will record additional loan loss provisions and realty impairment losses in the periods such events are known 
commitments we have received commitment fees for commitments to third parties to make loans and to fund construction in progress totaling  commitments include construction financings which have closed but which have not been fully funded as of december  and also investment amounts for which we have received a commitment fee but which have not been funded as of december  the following table sets forth certain information regarding our commitments as of december  commitments facility type facilities current future total in thousands long term care assisted living 

commitments sources of revenues general 
our revenues are derived primarily from mortgage interest income  rental income and the operation of foreclosure properties 
during  mortgage interest income equaled  of which all except  was from non nhc borrowers 
rental income totaled   of which was from properties operated by nhc 
the interest and rental payments are primarily derived from the operations of the health care facilities 
the source and amount of revenues from such operations are determined by i the licensed bed or other capacity of the health care facilities  ii the occupancy rate of the health care facilities  iii the extent to which the services provided at each health care facility are utilized by the patients  iv the mix of private pay  medicare and medicaid patients at the health care facilities  and v the rates paid by private paying patients and by the medicare and medicaid programs 
facility operating revenues are derived from the operations of the foreclosure properties and are determined by similar factors 
governmental and other concerns regarding health care costs have and may continue to result in significant reductions in payments to health care facilities  and there can be no assurance that future payment rates for either governmental or private health care plans will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care have and could continue to adversely affect revenues of our health related lessees and borrowers and thereby adversely affect those lessees and borrowers abilities to make their lease or debt payments to us 
failure of the lessees or borrowers to make their lease or debt payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on us 
medicare and medicaid 
a significant portion of the revenue of our foreclosure properties and our lessees and borrowers is derived from governmental funded reimbursement programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
medicare is a federal health insurance program under the social security act for individuals age and over and certain chronically disabled individuals 
the balanced budget act of bba made fundamental changes in the medicare program which have resulted in reduced levels of payment for a substantial portion of health care services 
amendments to the bba medicare enactments were made in late and late  which have enhanced operating revenues at medicare certified lessees and borrowers 
until october   when the enhancements expired again  substantially reducing payment levels  only modest increases were granted for the fiscal year beginning october  medicaid is a joint federal and state program designed to provide medical assistance to medically indigent persons 
these programs are operated by state agencies which adopt their own medical reimbursement formula and standards  and rates and covered services vary from state to state 
however  in many instances  revenues from medicaid programs are insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
moreover  health care facilities have experienced increasing pressures from private payors attempting to control health care costs  and reimbursement from private payors has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payors 
governmental funding of medicare and medicaid 
substantial cuts in medicare payments to nursing home providers were made beginning with the implementation of the bba and the prospective payment system in congress attempted to partially address the financial stress caused by these cuts through the enactment of the balance budget refinement act bbra in the fall of and the benefits and improvement and protection act bipa in the majority of improvements brought about by bbra and bipa  however  expired on september   again causing financial stress in the industry 
effective for the fiscal year beginning october   the centers for medicare and medicaid services increased reimbursement for medicare part a by in addition to the annual inflationary increase of 
the october  increases are substantially less than were the october  cuts 
no material changes to reimbursement are expected until cms refines the current rug iii case mix methodology 
furthermore  several of the states in which we have investments have actively sought ways to reduce or slow the increase of medicaid spending for nursing home care by such methods as capitated payments or reductions in reimbursement rates 
with capitated payments  the provider is responsible for providing  for a fixed fee  all services needed by certain patients 
capitated payments can result in significant losses if patients require extensive treatment not adequately covered by the capitated rate 
these cuts have caused significant financial stress in the long term care industry and to our tenants and borrowers  evidenced by bankruptcies and foreclosures 
the cuts have also negatively impacted our additional percentage rents and  in the case of renegotiated rents for troubled properties  the base rents we are paid from our skilled nursing facility tenants 
efforts to impose reduced payments  greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue 
any reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our tenants or borrowers 
we are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on its operations 
no assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on us  however  we believe the most material negative impact occurred during licensure and certification 
the health care industry is highly regulated by federal  state and local law  and is directly affected by state and local licensing requirements  facility inspections  state and federal reimbursement policies  regulations concerning capital and other expenditures  certification requirements  and other such laws  regulations and rules 
sanctions for failure to comply with these regulations and laws include but are not limited to loss of licensure  fines  and loss of certification to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs  as well as potential criminal penalties 
the failure of any lessee or borrower to comply with such laws  requirements and regulations could affect its ability to operate the facility or facilities and could adversely affect such lessee s or borrower s ability to make lease or debt payments to us 
in the past several years  due to rising health care costs  there has been an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
payment of any consideration in exchange for referral of medicare and medicaid patients is generally prohibited by federal statute  which subjects violators to severe penalties  including exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs  fines  and even prison sentences 
in recent years  both federal and state governments have significantly increased investigation and enforcement activity to detect and punish wrongdoers 
in addition  legislation has been adopted at both state and federal levels which severely restricts the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest 
it is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and enforcement activity in the area of fraud and abuse  as well as self referral  will continue in future years 
certain of our investments are with lessees or borrowers which are partially or wholly owned by physicians 
in the event that any lessee or borrower were to be found in violation of laws regarding fraud and abuse or self referral  that lessee s or borrower s ability to operate the facility as a health care facility could be jeopardized  which could adversely affect the lessee s or borrower s ability to make lease or debt payments to us and thereby adversely affect us 
certificates of need 
certain health care facilities in which we invest are also generally subject to state statutes which may require regulatory approval  in the form of a certificate of need con prior to the addition or construction of new beds  the addition of services or certain capital expenditures 
con requirements are not uniform throughout the united states and are subject to change 
we cannot predict the impact of regulatory changes with respect to con s on the operations of our lessees and mortgagees  however  in our primary market areas  a significant reduction in new construction of long term care beds has occurred 
investment policies our investment objectives are i to provide current income for distribution to our stockholders through investments primarily in health care related facilities  ii to provide the opportunity to realize capital growth resulting from appreciation  if any  in the residual value of our portfolio properties  and iii to preserve and protect stockholders capital 
there can be no assurance that these objectives will be realized 
it is not our intention to sell our properties and reinvest in other investments for the purpose of realizing gains resulting from the appreciation of value of those properties  we  however  may consider selling properties in the event circumstances should arise which would make a sale advisable or attractive  or to retire principal indebtedness 
nhi is currently limited in its ability to make new investments due to the unstable environment in which we operate and a lack of availability of reasonably priced capital 
we will continue to review our investment opportunities as we generate cash from our operating  investing and financing activities 
we anticipate making some new investments beginning in if we were to make new investments  we would consider such factors  as i the geographic area and type of property  ii the location  construction quality  condition and design of the property  iii the current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs and lease or mortgage obligations and to provide a competitive market return on equity to our investors  iv the growth  tax and regulatory environments of the communities in which the properties are located  v occupancy and demand for similar health care facilities in the same or nearby communities  vi the quality  experience and creditworthiness of the management operating the facilities located on the property  and vii the mix of private and government sponsored patients 
there can be no assurances that investments containing these attributes will be found or closed 
we will not  without the approval of a majority of the board of directors  enter into any joint venture relationships with or acquire from or sell to any director  officer  or employee of nhc or nhi  or any affiliate thereof  as the case may be  any of our assets or other property 
the board of directors  without the approval of the stockholders  may alter our investment policies if they determine that such a change is in our best interests and our stockholders best interests 
the methods of implementing our investment policies may vary as new investment and financing techniques are developed or for other reasons 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to make investments in health care related facilities or business when it is advisable in the opinion of the board of directors 
we may negotiate other lines of credit  or arrange for other short or long term borrowings from banks  nhc or otherwise 
we have and may arrange for long term borrowings from institutional investors or through public offerings 
we have invested and may in the future invest in properties subject to existing loans or secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens with favorable terms or remic investments 
advisory agreement we entered into the advisory agreement on october  with nhc as advisor under which nhc provides management and advisory services to us during the term of the advisory agreement 
we believe the advisory agreement benefits us by providing access to nhc s extensive experience in the ownership and management of long term care facilities and retirement centers 
under the advisory agreement  we engaged nhc to use its best efforts a to present to us a continuing and suitable investment program consistent with our investment policies adopted by the board of directors from time to time  b to manage our day to day affairs and operations  and c to provide administrative services and facilities appropriate for such management 
in performing its obligations under the advisory agreement  nhc is subject to the supervision of and policies established by our board of directors 
the advisory agreement was initially for a stated term which expired december  the agreement is now on a year to year term  but terminable on days notice  and we may terminate the advisory agreement for cause at any time 
for its services under the advisory agreement  the advisor is entitled to annual compensation in a base amount of  payable in monthly installments of  the full fee  although earned  will be prorated to the extent that funds from operations ffo is less than per share 
under the advisory agreement  we reimburse nhc for certain out of pocket expenses including those incurred in connection with borrowed money  taxes  fees to independent contractors  legal and accounting services and stockholder distributions and communications 
for and later years the annual compensation is calculated on a formula which is related to the increase in funds from operations per common share as defined in the advisory agreement 
in  the annual compensation expensed under the advisory agreement was approximately  the nhi board  in recognition of the fact that it chose to apply our ffo to debt payments during half of and three quarters of  rather than distribute dividends  amended the advisory agreement to delete the requirement that a per share dividend be paid 
the fee  however  is still dependent upon obtaining the stated ffo objective 
pursuant to the advisory agreement  nhc manages all of our day to day affairs and provides all such services through its personnel 
the advisory agreement provides that without regard to the amount of compensation received by nhc under the advisory agreement  nhc shall pay all expenses in performing its obligations including the employment expenses of the officers and directors and personnel of nhc providing services to us 
the advisory agreement further provides that we shall pay the expenses incurred with respect to and allocable to the prudent operation and business of nhi including any fees  salaries  and other employment costs  taxes and expenses paid to our directors  officers and employees who are not also employees of nhc

real estate mortgage investment conduits original participating interest properties original participating interest properties  item legal proceedings one of our owned nursing home properties  leased to a subsidiary of national healthcare corporation nhc and located in nashville  tennessee  was damaged by a tragic fire on september  which resulted in the loss of life or critical injury to a number of patients 
the building has been closed to patient care while nhi and nhc assess damages 
nhc is nhi s largest lessee  operating of nhi s properties 
under the terms of nhi s lease with nhc  nhc is required to restore the leased property so as to make it at least equal in value to that which existed prior to the damage 
the lease also requires nhc to indemnify and hold harmless nhi from any and all demands and claims arising from the use of the property including any negligence or violation by nhc 
nhi is a loss payee and additional named insured under the terms of nhc s property and casualty insurance policy 
the policy includes business interruption insurance and nhi believes it will receive of any rent due on the facility through the expected reconstruction process 
currently  rent income from the center totals approximately  annually 
furthermore  nhi is an additional named insured on nhc s professional and general liability insurance policy 
nhc has stated that the lessee  nhc healthcare nashville  llc and its parent nhc collectively have liability coverage of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate per location and annual aggregate excess coverage of  that is attributable to all of nhc s operated centers 
a provision of the lease allows that if substantial damage occurs during the lease term  nhc may terminate the lease with respect to the damaged property 
by agreement between nhi and nhc  this right extends through april  if the lease is so terminated  nhc will have no obligation to repair the property and nhi will receive the entire insurance proceeds related to the building damage 
nhc is obligated to continue to indemnify and hold harmless nhi from any and all demands arising from the use of the property 
nhi retains the right to license the beds under any lease termination 
nhi has been named as a defendant in eight lawsuits filed by patients and or representatives of patients arising out of the fire 
one of these cases has been dismissed 
these cases have been consolidated with all other lawsuits arising out of the fire in the third circuit court for davidson county  tennessee 
discovery is ongoing 
nhi plans to vigorously defend against the allegations in these lawsuits 
it is too early to make any assessment of any potential liability or cost to nhi 
at december   nhi has not accrued any liability for this contingent matter but will continue to closely monitor the situation 
there can be no assurance that claims will not exceed the limits of the insurance coverage or that additional claims will not be asserted against nhi 
nhi s potential liability from this incident or nhc s ability to meet any indemnification obligation to nhi cannot be determined at this time 
if nhc were unable to meet its obligations to nhi either as to indemnification  if required  or as to the payment of rent  it may have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
except as discussed above with respect to the nashville fire  we are not subject to any material pending litigation  although a number of our operators or mortgagors are currently in bankruptcy and or have multiple pending medical liability suits 
see foreclosures  troubled real estate properties  borrower bankruptcies  and non performing loans in item management s discussion 
the health care facilities are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business 
our lessees and mortgagees have indemnified and will continue to indemnify us against all liabilities arising from the operation of the health care facilities  and will indemnify us against environmental or title problems affecting the real estate underlying such facilities 
while there are lawsuits pending against certain of the owners and or lessees of the health care facilities  management believes that the ultimate resolution of all pending proceedings will have no material adverse effect on us or our operations 
through the operation of our foreclosure properties  we are subject to professional and general liability litigation for the provision of patient care 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
we have maintained or caused the majority of our lessees or mortgagees to maintain insurance coverage for this type of litigation 
in florida  however  coverage is limited 
we are subject to certain claims  none of which  in management s opinion  would be material to our financial position or results of operations

all distributions will be made by us at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on our cash flow and earnings  our financial condition  bank covenants contained in our financing documents and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
our reit taxable income is calculated without reference to our cash flow

as of december   we had interests in real estate owned  and investments in mortgages  real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  preferred stock and marketable securities resulting in total invested assets of  our mission is to invest in health care real estate which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
we have pursued this mission by making mortgage loans and acquiring properties to lease nationwide primarily in the long term health care industry 
as of december   we were diversified with investments in health care facilities located in states consisting of long term care facilities  one acute care hospital  four medical office buildings  assisted living facilities  six retirement centers and residential projects for the developmentally disabled 
these investments consisted of approximately million aggregate principal amount of loans to borrowers  million of purchase leaseback transactions with lessees and million invested in remic pass through certificates backed by first mortgage loans to ten operators 
of these facilities  were acquired through foreclosure and are owned and operated by us and are leased to national healthcare corporation nhc 
the owned and operated facilities are managed by subsidiaries of nhc 
nhc is our investment advisor 
consistent with our strategy of diversification  we have reduced the portion of our portfolio operated or managed by nhc from of total invested assets on october  to of total invested assets on december  at december   of the total invested assets of the health care facilities were operated by public operators  by regional operators  and by small operators 
areas of focus coinciding with the implementation of the prospective payment system for medicare payments to nursing homes in and the resulting decrease in revenues to health care providers  we significantly curtailed our new investments 
instead  we focused our attention on returning our non performing loans to performing status 
although our efforts are not complete  we continue to make progress in this regard 
we also focused on lowering our debt 
our debt to capitalization ratio on december  was  the lowest level in our year history 
our liquidity is also strong 
our cash and marketable securities totaled of total debt outstanding at the end of reflecting this progress and our improving outlook for the healthcare industry  we anticipate making some new investments beginning in while continuing to monitor and improve our existing properties 
even as we make new investments  however  we expect to maintain a relatively low level of debt vs 
equity compared to our historical levels 
accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our significant accounting policies and the associated estimates  judgments and the issues which impact these estimates are as follows valuations and impairments to our investments since the long term health care industry has experienced material reductions in government and private insurance reimbursements 
while some legislative relief was granted in and  additional reductions in reimbursement were imposed effective october  followed by only modest improvements implemented for the fiscal year beginning october  the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments about refinancing for our lessees and mortgagees 
based on events occurring during each of the last three years and the current year  we determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying amount of the property and may be affected by management s plans  if any  to dispose of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas 
we evaluate our marketable securities for other than temporary impairments consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accountant standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties  notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers for which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent is not realizable 
for these nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition third party payors approximately two thirds of our facility operating revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the third party payors 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds we have generated net cash from operating activities during totaling  an increase of  compared to  in the prior year 
the primary reason for this year s change was due to an increase in net income offset partially by a reduction in the provision for loan  realty  and security losses and by a net gain on sale of real estate 
net cash from operating activities generally includes net income plus non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization and provision for investment losses  and working capital changes 
net cash provided by investing activities during totaled  compared to  in the prior year 
cash flows provided from investing activities during included collections and prepayments on mortgage and other notes receivable of  including  from nhr compared to  for the prior year

this compares to prior year activity of principal payments on debt of  payments of convertible debentures of  and dividends paid to stockholders of  these payments on debt have addressed our major liquidity demands for the near future 
cash flows provided by financing activities during included proceeds of  from debt compared to  in the prior period 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities as of december   our contractual payment obligations and contingent liabilities were as follows contractual obligations in thousands thereafter total debt      convertible debentures   construction loan commitments management fees to nhc   we have guaranteed additional debt obligations totaling approximately  which are not included in the table above because we do not expect to fund these commitments 
interest expense has not been included in the above table due to the difficulty in projecting variable rate interest 
in  our cash payments for interest were  liquidity at the end of  our liquidity is strong  with cash and marketable securities totaling approximately of total debt outstanding 
further  our debt to book capitalization ratio declined to  the lowest level in our year history 
historically  nhi has faced significant liquidity demands resulting from principal repayments required by our senior secured bank credit facility and convertible debentures during  and these maturities have now been addressed 
in order to address the maturity of  of subordinated convertible debentures that matured on january   we issued  of senior subordinated convertible debentures on december   a portion of the proceeds of which  along with cash from operations  were used to retire that indebtedness 
by december  only  of these senior subordinated debentures remained outstanding  the balance having converted into common stock 
our entire  credit facility was paid in full and ahead of schedule on december  we accomplished this by not paying common stock dividends for two quarters in and three quarters of  plus using cash received from principal repayments from our outstanding third party mortgage notes 
in the first quarter of  we redeemed ahead of schedule million of convertible subordinated debentures that were due in february our next significant debt maturities primarily related to our million unsecured public notes are in common stock dividends having been discontinued for five successive quarters  in and  we declared a fourth quarter dividend of

commitments at december   we were committed  subject to due diligence and financial performance goals  to fund approximately  in health care real estate projects  none of which is expected to be funded within the next months 
the commitments include additional investments for one long term health care center  and one assisted living facility  at rates ranging from to 
nhi is currently limited in its ability to make new investments due to the unstable environment in which we operate and a lack of availability of reasonably priced capital 
we will continue to review our investment opportunities as we generate cash from our operating  investing and financing activities 
we anticipate making some new investments beginning in furthermore  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to finance current investments for which we are committed as well as to repay or refinance borrowings at or prior to their maturity 
debt and related guarantees as a result of certain agreements entered into with nhc during the fourth quarter of  nhi is not subject to cross default provisions with other debt of nhc  nhr and national health corporation 
foreclosures  troubled real estate properties  borrower bankruptcies  and non performing loans our borrowers  tenants and the properties we operate as foreclosure properties have experienced financial pressures and difficulties similar to those experienced by the health care industry in general since governments at both the federal and state levels have enacted legislation to lower or at least slow the growth in payments to health care providers 
furthermore  the costs of professional liability insurance have increased significantly during this same period 
a number of our real estate property operators and mortgage loan borrowers have experienced bankruptcy 
others have been forced to surrender properties to us in lieu of foreclosure and have otherwise failed to make timely payments on their obligations to us 
of our  net investment in real estate properties at december   approximately  have been identified as impaired investments 
impaired properties include properties which we operate and which are identified as foreclosure properties for federal income tax purposes 
of our  total net investment in mortgage and other notes receivable at december   approximately  of receivables have been involved in borrower bankruptcies or have otherwise been identified as non performing loans

we believe that the carrying amounts of our real estate properties and notes receivable  including those identified as impaired or non performing  are realizable and supported by the value of the underlying collateral 
however  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts 
investment in remics we have purchased participating interests in two separate real estate mortgage investment conduits remic totaling  as of december  some of the underlying properties included in the remics have experienced financial pressures similar to those described in the previous section  including bankruptcy 
we evaluate the carrying amounts of the remics quarterly based on actual cash payments received and revised cash flow projections that reflect updated assumptions about collectibility  interest rates and prepayment rates 
during the fourth quarter of  we collected  due to maturities in one of the remics 
the remainder of that remic  at december  matures december  the second remic  carrying value less a repayment obligation of  at december  is expected to be collected in see note to the financial statements for details of the remic investments 
we believe that the carrying amounts of our remic investments are realizable 
however  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments to these carrying amounts

we  therefore  disclose funds from operations  although it is a measurement that is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we generally use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit measure of funds from operations 
we define funds from operations as income before extraordinary items adjusted for certain non cash items  primarily real estate depreciation  less gain losses on sales of facilities 
our measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other reits 
consequently  our funds from operations may not provide a meaningful measure of our performance as compared to that of other reits 
funds from operations does not represent cash generated from operating activities as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states funds from operations does not include changes in operating assets and liabilities and  therefore  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as the primary indicator of operating performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
we have adopted the sec s interpretation that recurring impairments taken on real property may not be added back to net income in the calculation of ffo 
the sec s position is that recurring impairments on real property are not an appropriate adjustment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months when purchased 
all of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
our investment in preferred stock represents an investment in the preferred stock of another real estate investment trust and bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the underlying mortgages included in our investments in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics also bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investments in notes receivable  preferred stock and remics are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
as of december    of our debt bears interest at fixed interest rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
the remaining  of our debt and  of our convertible subordinated debentures bear interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would reduce our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments by  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would increase our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments by  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
the future use of such instruments will be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
equity price risk we consider our investments in marketable securities as available for sale securities and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with sfas the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
hypothetically  a change in quoted market prices would result in a related  change in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities 
in addition  a hypothetical change in the quoted market prices of our subordinated convertible debentures would result in a related  change in the fair value of the debenture instruments
