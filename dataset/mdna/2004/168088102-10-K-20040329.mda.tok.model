results of operations the past year was extremely difficult for the company 
after a relatively auspicious start  which fostered an optimistic outlook for the balance of the year  our business weakened considerably as production of domestic automobiles trailed prior year levels and domestic manufacturing activity  in general  remained weak 
in addition  our customers continued to demand price concessions  while simultaneously raising the bar with respect to quality and service requirements 
in response to these conditions  we relied on the time tested approach of cost containment and cost reductions 
in retrospect  it is clear that these actions were insufficient to offset the combined impact of lower volumes  lower prices and increased service expectations 
compared to reduced revenues were the dominant factor contributing to reduced margins within the fastener segment during fastener segment revenues declined abruptly late in the first quarter and remained weak for the balance of the year 
for the year  fastener segment revenues declined compared to  totaling a disappointing  reductions in north american production of domestic automobiles and trucks contributed to the weakness in our business as did continuing competitive pressures which contributed to the loss of some business  as we were unable to meet the price concessions demanded by certain customers 
in addition  some high margin parts were lost in connection with design changes that accompanied the new model year 
reductions in manufacturing staff failed to keep pace with the decline in business activity  and the resultant inefficiencies are reflected in disproportionately higher labor costs in  compared to in addition  margins were adversely affected by increases in the cost of employee health insurance and higher tooling expenses incurred in connection with the initial production of a variety of new parts 
within the assembly equipment segment  revenues declined compared to as was the case in the fastener segment  lower volumes contributed to significantly reduced operating efficiencies that were manifested in disproportionately high labor and benefit costs compared with prior years 
other factors impacting margins within this segment were increases in the cost of raw materials  offset in part  by a decrease in depreciation expense 
selling and administrative expenses for were below those for a  reduction in profit sharing expense was the largest single factor contributing to the decrease in this expense category  followed by reductions of  in bonus expense  and  in commission expense due to lower sales in the current year 
these reductions were partially offset by a  expense related to an early retirement program and an increase in the cost of employee health insurance 
net interest income increased by approximately  during  primarily as a result of lower interest expense related to lower balances on a note payable  which was paid in full in december 
compared to net sales and lease revenues improved approximately compared with and totaled  in as discussed below  revenue gains were achieved in both the fastener and assembly equipment segments and the increased volume  coupled with successful efforts to hold the line on costs  translated into improvements in gross margins  which amounted to  for  compared with  recorded in within the fastener segment  revenues increased  to  reflecting an overall increase in automobile production 
however  it should be noted that our volumes did not increase across our entire customer base 
instead  our overall gain was due to increases in business with certain key customers  bolstered by revenues related to new customers and new products from existing customers 
gross margins within the fastener segment improved to in  compared with recorded in this improvement was largely attributable to the effects of higher volumes and increases in efficiency associated with those higher volumes 
a number of other factors impacted operations during the year 
while we benefited from reductions in tooling costs  those savings were offset by increases in the cost of materials and by a substantial increase in the cost of employee health insurance 
activity levels within the assembly equipment segment remained well below historical levels 
while revenues within the segment improved to  in  compared with  in  the change is attributable to a few large orders and not due to any significant improvement in the market for equipment  which remained adversely affected by a persistent decline in the broad manufacturing sector and the related restraint on capital spending 
nevertheless  gross margins within this segment improved to approximately in compared with for this improvement is primarily attributable to higher volumes and reduced labor expense 
selling and administrative expenses increased approximately compared with both profit sharing and sales commissions increased as a result of higher sales and increased profits 
other factors contributing to the increase include higher salary expense and increased health insurance costs  partially offset by a decrease in the provision for bad debt expense  which was unusually high in the prior year due to the bankruptcy filing of a certain customer 
the company recorded net interest income during of  compared with net interest expense of  in  as a result of lower prevailing interest rates and reduced debt levels 
dividends in determining to pay dividends  the board considers current profitability  the outlook for longer term profitability  known and potential cash requirements and the overall financial condition of the company 
the company paid four regular quarterly dividends of 
per share during in addition  an extra dividend of 
per share was paid during the second quarter of  bringing the total dividend distribution to 
per share 
on february   your board of directors determined that an extra dividend would not be declared or paid in the second quarter of  however  the board did declare a regular quarterly dividend of 
per share  payable march  to shareholders of record on march  this continues the uninterrupted record of consecutive quarterly dividends paid by the company to its shareholders that extends over years 
property  plant and equipment during  capital expenditures amounted to  of which  was invested within the fastener segment   was invested within the assembly equipment segment and the remainder was expended for building improvements that cannot be allocated between segments 
within the fastener segment  approximately  was invested in a new solvent based parts cleaning system 
this system  installed during the second half of the year  is expected to yield reductions in supply and waste disposal costs 
other expenditures were approximately  for vehicles  including  for a new delivery truck   for in line wire drawing equipment  some  for equipment related to quality control  with the balance expended for smaller tools and equipment and building improvements 
within the assembly equipment segment  approximately  was expended for the purchase of new equipment related to the manufacture of perishable tooling that is sold to customers 
the balance was expended for building improvements and office equipment 
investments in machinery and equipment totaled  in the majority of this investment was related to the fastener segment of our operations 
approximately  was invested in new equipment directly related to the manufacture of fasteners  with an additional  expended for equipment related to quality control and finishing operations for the fastener segment 
the balance was expended for a variety of items  including material handling  data processing and other equipment 
the company invested approximately million in machinery  equipment and building improvements during the majority of these expenditures were related to the fastener segment of our operations 
specifically  a total of million was expended for the purchase of equipment used directly in the manufacture of fasteners and  was invested in new equipment related to the quality control process in fastener manufacturing 
 was expended in connection with data processing and data communications equipment   was spent for building improvements  primarily related to the fastener segment of our business  and the balance was expended for a variety of smaller machinery and equipment  including the manufacture of automatic rivet setting equipment that is leased to our customers 
depreciation expense amounted to  in   in and  in liquidity and capital resources the company s holdings in cash  cash equivalents and certificates of deposits amounted to nearly million at december   an increase of approximately 
million compared with the end of accounts receivable balances decreased approximately 
million  reflecting lower sales during the latter part of  compared to the same period in inventory levels  at the end of  are also less than at the end of due to efforts taken to reduce inventories in response to continued weakness in demand for our products 
in connection with a dutch auction tender offer in april  the company obtained  on an unsecured basis  a financing commitment that provided borrowing capacity of up to million plus a million line of credit 
the new borrowing was used to finance the unpaid balance of a loan related to the acquisition of h l tool company  inc million and to fund the purchase of stock under the terms of the dutch auction 
at december   the indebtedness under the term loan had been extinguished 
the line of credit was extended through may  and remained unused at december  off balance sheet arrangements the company has not entered into  and has no current plans to enter into  any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the following table presents a summary of the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than cotractual obligation total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases    purchase obligations     total     management believes that current cash  cash equivalents and operating cash flow will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for the foreseeable future 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
during interim periods  the company uses estimated gross profit rates to determine the cost of goods sold for a portion of its operations 
actual results can vary from these estimates  and these estimates are adjusted  as necessary  when actual information is available 
the effect of these estimates is described in note of the financial statements 
new accounting standards the company s financial statements and financial condition were not  and are not expected to be  materially impacted by new  or proposed  accounting standards 
stock purchase program terms of a stock repurchase authorization originally approved by the board of directors in february of  and subsequently amended to permit the repurchase of an aggregate of  shares  permit purchases of the company s common stock to be made from time to time  in the open market or in private transactions  at prices deemed reasonable by management 
the company did not purchase any of its shares during during  the company purchased  shares at an average price of per share 
cumulative purchases under the repurchase authorization have amounted to  shares at an average price of per share 
outlook for the anticipated improvement in economic activity has not yet generated a meaningful increase in orders for our products 
while we are encouraged by the fact that we have been awarded contracts for a number of new parts in the fastener segment  we are concerned about conditions within the assembly equipment segment  which remains very weak 
domestic competition remains intense and foreign competition  which affects us directly through the increase of imported fasteners and indirectly through the import of products that were previously assembled domestically  is a growing concern 
these conditions increase the risk that our markets will not only become even more price competitive due to imports  but will shrink in size as domestic assembly operations are supplanted by imports of products that were traditionally assembled domestically  utilizing domestic fasteners and domestic assembly equipment 
as mentioned above  we are pleased that we have been awarded new business within the fastener segment  but  in many instances  production volumes related to this new business will not reach significant levels until later in we will continue soliciting additional business from our current customers as well as from new customers 
we face challenges in the form of recent and significant increases in the cost of raw materials utilized in the production of fasteners 
while we have not experienced shortages of raw material  some of our suppliers report that increases in global demand may constrain availability of raw materials later this year 
our success in maintaining supply and recovering these higher costs  without losing market share  will be a critical determinant of our success in the coming year 
cost reduction will be another critical factor influencing future results 
as previously reported  we have already taken actions to reduce our manufacturing costs  but the cost reductions realized have not fully offset the impact of lower volumes 
we will continue exploring alternatives that will yield positive changes in our cost structure and our ability to compete 
margins  at least in the near term  will remain under pressure from the combination of rising costs and increasing foreign competition 
we gratefully acknowledge that the company s success  both past and future  would not be possible without the conscientious efforts of our employees  who consistently demonstrate their dedication to meeting the formidable and ever changing challenges that characterize today s manufacturing environment  the loyalty of our customers  many of whom face the same set of challenges  and  the continuing support of our shareholders 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the company did not have any outstanding debt  compared to million of outstanding debt at the prior year end  that was exposed to changes in interest rates 
during the company did not use derivative financial instruments relating to this interest rate exposure
