item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive summary tredegar is a manufacturer of plastic film and aluminum extrusions 
we also are developing and marketing bone graft substitutes through our therics subsidiary 
descriptions of our businesses are provided on pages our plastic films and aluminum extrusions businesses are quite different from therics 
they can be analyzed and valued by traditional measures of earnings and cash flow  and because they generate positive ongoing cash flow  they can be leveraged with borrowed funds 
therics is a start up company whose prospects and value currently depend on its ability to develop  manufacture  market  sell and profit from its orthopaedic product line 
therics may never generate profits or positive cash flow 
if it were a stand alone  independent operation  it would typically be financed by private venture capital 
more on therics is provided in the business segment review on page in film products  operating profit from ongoing operations and excluding volume shortfall payments was million in compared to million in this significant decline million or was almost entirely due to the loss of certain domestic backsheet business with p g 
in aluminum extrusions  operating profit from ongoing operations declined to million in volume of million pounds from million in volume of million pounds 
the million or decline in operating profit was driven by appreciation of the canadian dollar against the us dollar unfavorable impact of million  higher energy costs up million  lower volume unfavorable impact of million and higher insurance costs up million 
our films and aluminum businesses showed little momentum as closed 
first quarter ongoing operating profit in films is expected to remain near fourth quarter levels million 
profit growth will be difficult to achieve until we see a sustainable increase in sales 
an important part of our strategy is the rollout of a new feminine pad topsheet for p g for european markets  which began in we believe the rollout is progressing well  and we continue to invest in increased european capacity see page for net sales and identifiable assets by geographic area 
we believe higher sales and profits will ultimately result from this and other new products as well as our capital investments capital spending in was million or million in excess of depreciation and global expansion over the last several years 
more on film products is provided in the business segment review on pages our aluminum business continues to struggle under difficult market conditions  which are not likely to improve during the seasonally weak winter months 
if our markets improve with the economy  we anticipate resumption in growth and increased profitability as we move into the spring 
we have a high degree of operating leverage in aluminum extrusions at our current level of fixed costs and contribution margin  and we estimate that a change in volume has a impact on operating profit 
more on aluminum extrusions is provided in the business segment review on pages we sold our venture capital investment portfolio in the first quarter of for cash proceeds of approximately million  and its activities have been reported as discontinued operations 
the sale generated income taxes recoverable of approximately million 
we expect to receive these funds from the us internal revenue service the irs in mid more on the sale of the venture capital portfolio is provided in the business segment review on pages on october   we refinanced our debt 
key terms and borrowing capacity under our new credit facility are summarized in the financial condition review on pages critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgments that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
impairment and useful lives of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill we regularly assess our long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
any necessary impairment charges are recorded when we do not believe the carrying value of the long lived asset will be recoverable 
we also reassess the useful lives of our long lived assets based on changes in our business and technologies 
we assess goodwill for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis december of each year 
we have made determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill and intangible assets should be allocated to those reporting units 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived identifiable assets and goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if impairment tests are met or the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
based upon assessments performed  we recorded asset impairment losses for continuing operations related to long lived identifiable assets of million in  million in and million in pension benefits we have noncontributory and contributory defined benefit pension plans that have significant net pension income developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension income recorded in future periods 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  our liability increases as the discount rate decreases and vice versa 
we reduced our discount rate in each of the last three years the rate was at the end of  at the end of  at the end of and at the end of due to the decline in market interest rates 
the compensation increase assumption affects the estimate of future payments  and was at the end of  at the end of and at the end of lower compensation increases are expected as a result of lower inflation 
a lower expected return on plan assets increases the amount of expense and vice versa 
decreases in the level of actual plan assets will also serve to increase the amount of pension expense 
during  the value of our plan assets increased due to improved general market conditions after declining in  and based on recent market and economic conditions and asset mix  we decreased our expected long term return on plan assets to in estimating our net pension income our expected return was in and in and prior years 
we currently expect net pension income to decline in by approximately  compared to after declining by million in compared to we expect our minimum cash funding requirement to be less than  in deferred tax assets many deductions for tax return purposes cannot be taken until the expenses are actually paid  rather than when the expenses are recorded for book purposes 
in these circumstances  we accrue for the tax benefit expected to be received in future years if  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that we will receive such benefits 
on a quarterly basis  we review our judgment regarding the likelihood the benefits of a deferred tax asset will be realized 
during the periodic reviews  we must consider a variety of factors  including the nature and amount of the tax income and expense items  the anticipated timing of the ability to utilize the asset  the current tax statutes and the projected future earnings 
we believe the realization of our deferred tax assets is reasonably assured 
if circumstances change and management determines it is no longer more likely than not that an asset will be utilized  an offsetting valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce the asset and net earnings in that period 
results of operations versus revenues 
overall  sales for decreased compared with net sales sales less freight for film products and aluminum extrusions declined primarily due to lower sales volume  partially offset by higher selling prices driven by higher raw material costs

for more information on molecumetics  see the business segment review on page versus revenues 
sales decreased by in to million compared with million in net sales sales less freight were lower in aluminum extrusions and film products 
the lower net sales in aluminum extrusions were due primarily to a decline in volume due to continued weak economic conditions  especially in our end markets 
volume in film products was also down  however  the impact on net sales of lower overall volume was partially offset by revenue from volume shortfall payments

gross profit sales minus cost of goods sold and freight as a percentage of sales during increased to from in  with higher margins realized in both film products and aluminum extrusions 
the margin improvement in film products was driven by higher sales of new higher margin products combined with volume shortfall payments 
the gross profit margin in aluminum extrusions was helped by the reduction of fixed costs that resulted primarily from the shutdown of our plant in el campo  texas the el campo plant 
sg a expenses in were million  compared with sg a expenses of million in the increase was primarily due to higher expenses in film products in support of additional marketing activities and personnel additions  particularly in europe and asia

see note on page we believe that existing borrowing availability  our current cash balances  the income tax refund expected from the sale of the venture capital portfolio  and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and dividend requirements for the foreseeable future 
from time to time  we enter into transactions with third parties in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the buyers or third parties involved in the sale for certain liabilities or risks related to the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of our business  we may enter into agreements with third parties for the sale of goods or services that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability for indemnification would be subject to an assessment of the underlying facts and circumstances under the terms of the applicable agreement 
further  any indemnification payments may be limited or barred by a monetary cap  a time limitation  or a deductible or basket 
for these reasons  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of the potential future liability under the indemnity provisions of these agreements 
we do  however  accrue for losses for any known contingent liability  including those that may arise from indemnification provisions  when future payment is probable 
we disclose contingent liabilities if the probability of loss is reasonably possible and significant

cash flows the discussion below supplements the information presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows on page in  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared with million in the increase is due to a decrease in the level of primary net working capital accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable partially offset by lower income from ongoing operations 
accounts receivable declined mainly from volume shortfall payments and contract terminations and revisions in film products accrued at the end of and received in about million in accounts receivable at the end of versus none at the end of 
accounts payable increased due to the timing of payments 
inventories increased primarily due to the appreciation of the euro and the canadian dollar 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in this decrease was due to positive cash flow from venture capital activities in versus negative cash flow in and higher proceeds from the sale of corporate assets and property disposals see note on page for more information  partially offset by higher capital expenditures and acquisitions up million 
see the business segment review beginning on page regarding capital expenditures in and  the sale of the venture capital investment portfolio in and a related expected income tax refund 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in this increase was driven by scheduled debt payments and debt payments made in conjunction with our refinancing in see pages for more information 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in the decrease is due to an increase in working capital in versus a decrease in working capital in  partially offset by higher income from manufacturing operations up million 
the increase in working capital in was mainly due to higher receivables  primarily from volume shortfall payments and contract terminations and revisions in film products up million 
the decrease in working capital in was mainly due to lower receivables down million  primarily from a drop in volume in aluminum extrusions in the fourth quarter of net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase was driven by negative cash flow from venture capital activities in versus positive cash flow in  partially offset by lower capital expenditures and acquisitions down million 
net cash used in financing activities was about the same in and in  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared with million in in the statement of cash flows  income taxes related to venture capital investment activities  divestitures and property disposals are classified in operating activities  while related gains and losses are effectively classified with proceeds in investing activities 
in addition  income tax benefits on write downs of venture capital investments typically lag financial reporting recognition 
consequently  despite pretax losses after operating expenses from venture capital investment activities of million in  cash provided by operating activities includes related income taxes paid of  for the year 
pretax gains after operating expenses for venture capital investment activities were million in and cash used in operating activities includes related income taxes paid of million 
the remaining differences between and are primarily due to a decrease in working capital  increased spending at therics and molecumetics  and lower income from manufacturing operations down million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million in this change was mainly driven by a decline in proceeds in excess of investments in venture capital of million  partially offset by lower capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures in reflect the normal replacement of machinery and equipment and press modernization at our aluminum extrusions plant in kentland  indiana  a new films manufacturing facility in shanghai  china  continued expansion of our films manufacturing capacity in retsag  hungary  machinery and equipment purchased for a new production line at our films plant in terre haute  indiana  and machinery and equipment purchased to upgrade production lines at our films plant in kerkrade  the netherlands 
net cash used in financing activities was about the same in and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tredegar has exposure to the volatility of interest rates  polyethylene and polypropylene resin prices  aluminum ingot and scrap prices  energy prices  foreign currencies and emerging markets 
see the section on liabilities  credit and long term obligations beginning on page regarding credit agreements and interest rate exposures 
changes in resin prices  and the timing of those changes  could have a significant impact on profit margins in film products 
profit margins in aluminum extrusions are sensitive to fluctuations in aluminum ingot and scrap prices as well as natural gas prices 
there is no assurance of our ability to pass through higher raw material and energy costs to our customers 
resin costs for film products increased in the changes in the price of low density polyethylene resin shown in the chart below a primary raw material for film products are generally reflective of the historical price changes of most of the resins that the company purchases 

graphgif 
the price of resin is driven by several factors including supply and demand and the price of natural gas  ethane and ethylene 
for a portion of the volume in film products  our most effective means of mitigating resin price fluctuations is by passing on resin price changes to customers 
some pass through arrangements are on a time lag  where the impact of movement in resin prices is recovered in the subsequent quarter or quarters 
many of the mechanisms for pass through with our customers are based on published prices 
we estimate that pass through arrangements have reduced the effects of resin price volatility by about since the third quarter of  with the remaining exposure resulting in a possible impact on quarterly operating profit of as much as million 
in the normal course of business  we enter into fixed price forward sales contracts with certain customers for the sale of fixed quantities of aluminum extrusions at scheduled intervals 
in order to hedge our exposure to aluminum price volatility under these fixed price arrangements  which generally have a duration of not more than months  we enter into a combination of forward purchase commitments and futures contracts to acquire or hedge aluminum  based on the scheduled deliveries 
see note on page for more information 

graphgif 
in aluminum extrusions  we hedge from time to time a portion of our exposure to natural gas price volatility by entering into fixed price forward purchase contracts with our natural gas suppliers 
as of december   we had forward contracts with natural gas suppliers covering approximately of our future needs through march   with an average fixed price of per mmbtu 
we estimate that  in an unhedged situation  every per mmbtu per month change in the market price of natural gas has a  impact on the monthly operating profit of aluminum extrusions 
substantially higher prices of natural gas in resulted in a reduction in operating profit in aluminum extrusions of approximately million

we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign operations and through exports from us plants 
the percentage of sales and total assets for manufacturing operations related to foreign markets for and are as follows tredegar corporation manufacturing operations percentage of net sales and total assets related to foreign markets of total net sales total assets of total net sales total assets exports from us foreign oper ations foreign oper ations exports from us foreign oper ations foreign oper ations canada europe latin america asia total exposure to foreign markets the percentages for foreign markets are relative to tredegar s total net sales  and total assets from manufacturing operations consolidated net sales and total assets from continuing operations excluding cash and cash equivalents  therics  losses associated with plant shutdowns  asset impairments and restructurings  unusual items and gains from sale of assets 
we attempt to match the pricing and cost of our products in the same currency except in canada where about of our sales of aluminum extrusions are us dollar based and generally view the volatility of foreign currencies and emerging markets  and the corresponding impact on earnings and cash flow  as part of the overall risk of operating in a global environment 
exports from the us are generally denominated in us dollars 
our foreign currency exposure on income from foreign operations in europe primarily relates to the euro and the hungarian forint 
the relatively high percentage of us dollar priced sales in canada is partly due to the shifting of a large portion of the customers previously served by the el campo plant in the resulting mismatch between the currency denomination of sales and costs causes lower us dollar translated profits when the canadian dollar appreciates since our costs are higher in us dollar equivalent terms while sales are mostly unaffected the opposite effect occurs when the canadian dollar depreciates in value relative to the us dollar 
we estimate that the significant appreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during up on average by in and when comparing december  and exchange rates had an adverse impact on the operating profit in aluminum extrusions in of about million 
in film products  where we have been able to better match the currency of our sales and costs  we estimate that the significant appreciation of the euro and forint relative to the us dollar in up on average by and  respectively  in and and  respectively  when comparing december  and exchange rates had a positive impact on the operating profit in film products in of about million 
we are reviewing the loading of our aluminum extrusions plants in north america to optimize production mix and minimize cost in light of the increase in the us dollar equivalent cost structure of our plants in canada

forward looking and cautionary statements from time to time  we may make statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on our then current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those addressed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such a difference include  but are not limited to the following general our future performance is influenced by costs incurred by our operating companies including  for example  the cost of energy and raw materials 
there is no assurance that we will be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs through price increases 
further  there is no assurance that cost control efforts will be sufficient to offset any additional future declines in revenue or increases in energy  raw material or other costs 
film products film products is highly dependent on sales associated with one customer  p g 
p g comprised of tredegar s net sales in  in and in the loss or significant reduction of sales associated with p g would have a material adverse effect on our business  as would delays in p g rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by tredegar 
while we have undertaken efforts to expand our customer base  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful  or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with p g 
see the business segment review on pages for a discussion regarding the loss of p g s domestic backsheet business 
growth of film products depends on our ability to develop and deliver new products  especially in the personal care market 
personal care products are now being made with a variety of new materials  replacing traditional backsheet and other components 
while we have substantial technical resources  there can be no assurance that our new products can be brought to market successfully  or if brought to market successfully  at the same level of profitability and market share of replaced films 
a shift in customer preferences away from our technologies  our inability to develop and deliver new profitable products  or delayed acceptance of our new products in domestic or foreign markets  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
film products operates in a field where our significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios 
the continued success of this business depends on our ability not only to protect our own technologies and trade secrets  but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents 
although we are not currently involved in any patent litigation  an unfavorable outcome of any such action could have a significant adverse impact on film products 
as film products expands its personal care business  we have greater credit risk that is inherent in broadening our customer base 
aluminum extrusions sales volume and profitability of aluminum extrusions is cyclical and highly dependent on economic conditions of end use markets in the united states and canada  particularly in the construction  distribution and transportation industries 
our market segments are also subject to seasonal slowdowns during the winter months 
from to the second quarter of  profits in aluminum extrusions grew as a result of positive economic conditions in the markets we serve and manufacturing efficiencies 
however  a slowdown in these markets in the second half of resulted in a decline in sales volume and decline in ongoing operating profit compared with the second half of the aluminum extrusions industry continued to be affected by poor economic conditions in and our sales volume declined and operating profit declined in compared with in  our sales volume declined and operating profit declined compared with the decline in ongoing operating profit during these periods at approximately two to three times the rate of the decline in sales volume illustrates the operating leverage inherent in our operations fixed operating costs 
moreover  in higher energy and insurance costs and the appreciation of the canadian dollar against the us dollar had an adverse impact on operating profits 
any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts that usually accompany a downturn 
the markets for our products are highly competitive with product quality  service and price being the principal competitive factors 
as competitors increase capacity or reduce prices to increase business  there could be pressure to reduce prices to our customers 
aluminum extrusions is under increasing domestic and foreign competitive pressures  including a growing presence of chinese imports in a number of markets 
this competition could result in loss of market share due to a competitor s ability to produce at lower costs and sell at lower prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain current margins and profitability 
our continued success and prospects depend on our ability to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross cycle growth 
therics therics has incurred losses since inception  and we are unsure when  or if  it will become profitable 
we are in the initial stages of commercializing certain orthobiologic products that have received fda clearances 
there can be no assurance that any of these products can be brought to market successfully 
the commercialization of new future products will require significant research  development  preclinical and clinical testing  and regulatory approvals 
where potential new products do not advance beyond early product development or do not demonstrate preclinical or clinical efficacy  they will not likely be commercialized 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the fda and other regulatory authorities will clear our products in a timely manner 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on our ability to internally develop preclinical  clinical  regulatory  manufacturing and sales  distribution and marketing capabilities  or enter into arrangements with third parties to provide those functions 
we may not be successful in developing these capabilities or entering into agreements with third parties on favorable terms 
to the extent we rely on third parties for these capabilities  our control over such activities may be reduced which could make us dependent upon these parties 
the inability to develop or contract for these capabilities would significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize products and thus our ability to become profitable 
related factors that may impair our ability to develop and commercialize products include our reliance on pre clinical and clinical data concerning our products and product introductions by competing companies 
likewise  in the event we are unable to manufacture our products efficiently  our ability to commercialize products and thus our operating results will be negatively affected 
we are relying to a significant degree on a sales force consisting of independent sales agents for the sale and marketing of our products 
market acceptance of our products  and thus our ability to become profitable  is largely dependent upon the competency of this sales force  whether they perform their duties in line with our expectations and their continued willingness to carry our products 
our ability to develop and commercialize products will depend on market acceptance of those products 
we are dependent upon the willingness of the medical community to learn about and try our products and then switch from currently used products to our products 
in the event the community is reluctant or unwilling to utilize our products  our ability to generate profits will be significantly impaired 
commercial success is also dependent upon third party payor acceptance of our products 
our ability to develop and commercialize certain products is dependent upon sufficient sources of supply for various raw materials 
we may not be successful in procuring the types and quantities of raw materials necessary to commercialize certain orthobiologic products  which would significantly impair our ability to become profitable 
future sales and profits are dependent upon obtaining and maintaining all necessary regulatory approvals 
we have received clearances from the fda for our theriridge and therilok formerly named therifil products as medical devices  which approvals must be maintained in order to commercialize these products 
similar fda approval will need to be obtained for any new products in order to market those products 
in addition  depending upon where we intend to engage in marketing activities  we may need to obtain the necessary approvals from the regulatory agencies of the applicable jurisdictions 
failure to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals would significantly impair our ability to market our products and thus our ability to generate profits 
likewise  the marketing of our products and our profit generating capability would be impaired in the event approval of one or more of our products is limited or restricted by the fda  either in conjunction with or subsequent to approval 
we are highly dependent on several principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to recruit key personnel could have a material adverse effect on therics business and results of operations  and could inhibit product research and development  commercialization and sales and marketing efforts 
failure to retain and recruit executive management in key areas  including sales and marketing and product research and development  could prevent us from achieving our business objectives 
we are dependent upon certain license rights  patents and other proprietary rights 
future success is dependent in part on our ability to maintain and enforce license  patent and other proprietary rights 
complex legal and technical issues define the strength and value of our intellectual property portfolio 
while we own or license certain patents  the issuance of a patent does not establish conclusively either validity or enforceability 
the patent positions of biotechnology firms generally are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions that can determine who has the right to develop a particular product 
no clear policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims covered by biotechnology patents in the us the biotechnology patent situation outside the us is even more uncertain and is currently undergoing review and revision in many countries 
changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the us and other countries might allow others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our products without any compensation to us 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of our products subject us to product liability risk  an inherent risk for our industry 
a successful product liability action against us may have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  present insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover potential future product liability claims

film products net sales 
net sales in film products were million in  million in and million in net sales include revenue related to volume shortfall payments of million in and million in none in 
while we continue to have volume shortfall agreements in place for certain products  the majority of payments received in relate to older supply agreements for which volume commitments have expired 
we do not expect to receive significant revenues from volume shortfall payments in total volume was million pounds in  million pounds in  and million in excluding the effects of volume shortfall payments  net sales and volume declines in were primarily due to the loss of certain domestic backsheet business with p g 
domestic backsheet net sales excluding volume shortfall payments were approximately million in and million in net sales related to the p g domestic backsheet business excluding volume shortfall payments that was lost totaled approximately million in most of these sales occurred in the first quarter of and million in our domestic backsheet business has been declining since  when related net sales to p g and other customers were million 
during and  we were successful in offsetting the negative impact of the decline by commercializing new diaper and feminine hygiene components for a growing global customer base 
the decline accelerated significantly with the loss in of certain domestic backsheet business with p g 
we lost share in domestic backsheet as the market transitioned from products made from film to products made from laminates of film and nonwovens 
we did not anticipate this market change and fell behind on the technology curve 
once initial business was lost  economies of scale began to increasingly favor the competition resulting in additional lost business 
we have made a number of changes in response to losing this business  including increasing our marketing resources  conducting our own consumer research and selling to the broader marketplace 
while we continue to sell backsheet products on a global basis  our primary prospects for growth relate to apertured films and nonwoven materials used as topsheets in feminine hygiene products for example  our new apertured topsheet product for p g s sanitary napkin business is currently being introduced in europe  elastic films used in baby diapers for example  our elastic fastening components improve overall comfort and fit  films used in adult incontinent products for example  our elastic films and transfer layers meet the growing need for adult incontinent products that improve the lifestyles of an aging population  films used for surface protection for example  our protective film is used to protect high cost flat panel display components such as glass during fabrication  shipping and handling  films used for packaging for example  our thin gauge high density polyethylene film used as overwrap for tissue and towel products provides customers with cost savings and is readily printable and convertible on conventional processing equipment  and continued global expansion efforts 
excluding domestic backsheet sales  net sales in film products grew at a compounded annual growth rate of from on a volume basis
