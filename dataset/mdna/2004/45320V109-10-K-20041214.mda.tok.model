quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rates  but are exposed to risks such as variable interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our subsidiaries do not have supply contracts with any of their foreign vendors 
all foreign vendors are paid in united states currency 
in addition  tst s international sales of finished goods are insignificant 
accordingly  there are not sufficient factors to create a material foreign exchange rate risk  therefore  we do not use exchange commitments to minimize the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we had both fixed rate and variable rate debts as of august  the fair market value of long term variable interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally the fair market value of variable interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates fall and increase as interest rates rise

based upon our market risk sensitive debt outstanding at august   there was no material exposure to our financial position or results of operations
