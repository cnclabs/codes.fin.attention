our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in part i of this annual report on form k 
results of operations lam research corporation lam or the company is a major supplier of wafer fabrication equipment and services to the world s semiconductor industry 
we actively market and sell product offerings that include single wafer plasma etch systems with a wide range of applications  wafer cleaning systems  and an array of services designed to optimize the utilization of these systems by our customers 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has historically experienced periodic downturns and upturns 
over the past three business cycles  the severity of these fluctuations has increased  and today s leading indicators of changes in customer investment patterns may not be any more reliable than in prior years 
demand for our equipment can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  economic conditions  supply  demand  and prices for semiconductors  customer capacity requirements  and our ability to develop and market competitive products 
for these and other reasons  our results of operations for fiscal   and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
strengthening demand that we had noted early in fiscal and our belief that we are gaining market share manifested themselves in the progression of our quarterly revenues 
we have continued to focus on our systems and service competitiveness and the implementation of strategies aimed at achieving a more variable cost structure 
these efforts  combined with higher volumes  are illustrated by gross margin improvements year over year  including both fiscal and fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to cease further investment in cmp systems development 
this decision was based on the conclusion that the product did not demonstrate sufficient advantages to garner the market share necessary for adequate returns on further investment 
also during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repaid in full our convertible subordinated notes notes  two years prior to maturity  and we settled our interest rate swap agreement the swap which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our fixed rate notes 

table of contents we continue to invest significantly in research and development to strengthen our product and service offerings and competitive position 
increases in operating expenses during fiscal were primarily due to a growth in salary and benefits costs  a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive based benefits triggered by higher profits 
in addition  spending increased during fiscal for discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the company 
these costs have been partially offset by a decrease in facilities related expenses as a result of infrastructure rationalization and consolidation 
total revenue year ended percent change june  june  june  versus versus in thousands revenue the increase in revenues for fiscal year compared to the prior year is reflective of a market environment that has improved  evidenced by expanded levels of capital investments by semiconductor manufacturers 
signs of improvement in demand for wafer processing equipment  noted early in  continued through the year 
these improvements in demand as well as our belief of market share gains are evidenced by the progression of our quarterly revenues 
the overall increase in our revenues is influenced by increased demand  system installation cycles and customer acceptances 
our current estimate for revenues for the september quarter is approximately to million 
the decrease in revenue for fiscal year compared to fiscal year reflected our customers response to excess capacity in the semiconductor industry  which was significantly influenced by the retrenchment of the global economy and levels of end user demand for products servicing telecommunications  computer  and consumer electronics markets 
semiconductor manufacturers selectively invested in leading edge technology equipment through fiscal overall  demand remained relatively flat during fiscal based on the guidance provided by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  we generally recognize new systems revenue when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations 
refer to our discussion of critical accounting policies within this document for additional information about our revenue recognition policy 
where customer acceptance provisions exist  the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize systems revenue is typically determined based on the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment to agreed standards and specifications 
in accordance with sab  in situations with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations 
consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
on average  revenue recognition for systems normally occurs from two to five months after the date of shipment 
spares and system upgrade revenues are generally recognized on the date of shipment  and service revenues are generally recognized upon performance of the activities requested by the customer  including training and extended warranty support 

table of contents regional geographic breakdown of revenue is as follows year ended june  june  june  north america europe asia pacific japan the asia pacific region has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues as a substantial amount of the worldwide capacity for semiconductor manufacturing is located within this region  this trend has continued 
the growth in asia pacific revenues during fiscal year predominantly occurred in taiwan and singapore 
the fiscal increase in asia pacific revenues reflected expanded foundry capabilities and investments by certain of our customers to support the introduction of latest generation integrated circuit manufacturing 
gross margin year ended percent change june  june  june  versus versus in thousands  except percentages gross margin percent of total revenue we have continued to focus on systems design to achieve more efficient purchasing and installation processes 
our performance is evidenced by six successive quarters progression of gross margin as a percent of total revenues 
the increase in gross margin as a percent of total revenues of approximately six percentage points in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to improved utilization of factory and field resources  expense management programs  and improved sales volumes throughout the year 
fiscal gross margin includes million of asset impairment charges related to our discontinuance of work on cmp systems development as discussed earlier in the introductory paragraph within results of operations in this section 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recovered and recorded  in cost of goods sold  million and million  respectively  from unanticipated sales of certain inventories previously written off as part of our september restructuring 
we expect that gross margin as a percent of total revenue will be approximately during the september quarter 
the primary objectives of our strategy to outsource manufacturing activities included a plan to avoid future fixed cost infrastructure and to achieve a more variable cost structure  by establishing transaction based pricing agreements with vendors 
in addition  we have realized opportunities to achieve lower material and assembly costs through improved systems design and leverage from a more focused supplier base 
our restructuring plans  combined with ongoing cost management activities have supported improved utilization rates in our manufacturing and customer support operations  also contributing to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in the two most recent fiscal years 
the manufacturing assembly outsourcing model has required fundamental changes within the supply chain and within our business processes 
one objective of this strategy is to minimize certain costs related to holding inventories and managing product lifecycles 
in this context  we had incurred incremental excess and obsolete inventory charges of million in the second fiscal quarter of  and million of inventory restructuring expenses 
the charges in fiscal reflected the known and anticipated impact of the downturn on our business at that point in time 
the reduction in excess and obsolete inventory costs in fiscal reflects more stability in 
table of contents quarter on quarter business levels during the year and our continued emphasis on the minimization of costs discussed above 
approximately percentage points of year over year improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenues for fiscal reflects the million of charges to cost of goods sold related to a patent litigation settlement in fiscal in the second fiscal quarter of  we signed a final settlement agreement in connection with a patent infringement claim by varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc varian 
we agreed to pay varian million in cash and issued them a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million 
in connection with this settlement  we recorded a charge of million in fiscal  and the remaining amount of the settlement  million  represented the value of future licensed use of patents we received 
the million relating to the license was amortized ratably over the subsequent quarters as a charge to cost of goods sold 
the million license was fully amortized at june  research and development year ended percent change june  june  june  versus versus in thousands  except percentages research development percent of total revenue to better position ourselves competitively  we continue to invest significantly in research and development aiming at strengthening our product and services portfolio via the introduction of next generation products as well as enhancement of our existing offerings 
approximately of fiscal systems revenues are derived from products introduced over the previous two years 
the decrease in expenses as a percent of total revenues is due to increased sales volumes as our fiscal year revenue growth was nearly four times our r d expense growth rate 
the growth in spending between fiscal and fiscal is primarily due to increases in salary and benefits costs of approximately million  a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive based benefits triggered by higher profits 
approximately million of the overall increase occurred throughout several categories and was due primarily to the increase in business activity 
these costs were partially offset by reductions in facilities related expenses  largely reflected in reduced depreciation costs of roughly million  due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation 
we do not expect that our decision to cease further investment in cmp systems development will have a significant impact on future r d expense levels 
spending in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal and included a reduction in employee related expenses and supplies expenses of approximately million  and lower infrastructure costs  principally reflected in reduced depreciation and amortization of another million 
fiscal expenses included approximately million related to impairment charges and write downs in the value of selected laboratory equipment  which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of the lower sales volume in fiscal 
table of contents selling  general and administrative year ended percent change june  june  june  versus versus in thousands  except percentages selling  general administrative sg a percent of total revenue significant increases in profits during fiscal supported the company increasing employee compensation in fiscal year by nearly million  a result of planned increases of employee compensation to competitive levels and incentive based benefits triggered by higher profits 
also contributing to the fiscal sg a expense growth was a rise in outside services of approximately million primarily due to costs incurred for discretionary information technology projects designed to contribute to productivity improvements across the company 
a decrease of approximately million  primarily in depreciation expense  due to infrastructure rationalization and consolidation partially offset the rise in expenses noted above 
infrastructure rationalization and consolidation  including reduced facilities  contributed the majority of the annual cost reduction from fiscal to fiscal in addition  sg a expenses in fiscal included a million impairment charge related to the write down in value of certain demonstration equipment used in sales and marketing activities  which was determined to be no longer useful due to technological changes 
we expect total operating expenses will be approximately million during the september quarter 
restructuring charges we have developed plans and incurred restructuring charges to respond to the high level of volatility and  at times  depressed levels of capital investment by the semiconductor industry 
the frequency of our restructuring plans has been driven by the unpredictable and substantial changes in the semiconductor industry as a whole and the market for semiconductor processing equipment in particular 
these dynamic changes in the semiconductor industry and our business have required multiple integrated responses  including those activities within our restructuring plans  based on the best information and industry expert forecasts available at that point in time 
although management makes every attempt to consolidate all known restructuring activities into one plan  the extreme nature of our industry s business cycles and the rapidly changing forecasting environment places practical limitations on achieving this objective 
the implementation of restructuring activities and recognition of their impact in our financial statements does not preclude similar but unrelated actions from being necessary in future periods 
we systematically review our revenue outlook and forecasts and assess their impact on required employment levels  facilities utilization  and outsourcing activities 
based on these evaluations  our senior management committed to cost reduction and exit activities in the quarters ended march  the march plan  december  the december plan  september  the september plan  june  the june plan  march  the march plan  december  the december plan  december  the december plan  and september  the september plan 
prior to the end of each quarter noted above  we initiated the announced restructuring activities and management with the proper level of authority approved specific actions under the respective plan 
severance packages to potentially impacted employees were communicated in enough detail such that the employees could determine their type and amount of benefit 
the termination of the affected employees occurred as soon as practical after the restructuring plans were announced 
the amount of remaining future lease payments for facilities we ceased to use and included in the restructuring charges is based on management s estimates using known prevailing real estate market conditions at that time based  in part  on the opinions of independent real estate experts 
leasehold improvements relating to the vacated buildings were written off  as these items will have no future economic benefit to us and have been abandoned 
we distinguish regular operating cost management activities from restructuring activities 
accounting for restructuring activities requires an evaluation of formally committed and approved plans 
restructuring activities 
table of contents have comparatively greater strategic significance and materiality and may involve exit activities  whereas regular cost containment activities are more tactical in nature and are rarely characterized by formal and integrated action plans or exiting a particular product  facility  or service 
as of june   the overall restructuring reserve balance consisted of the following severance and benefits facilities total in thousands fiscal restructurings fiscal restructurings fiscal restructurings pre fiscal restructurings balance at june  the severance and benefits related costs are anticipated to be utilized by the end of fiscal year the facilities balance consists primarily of lease payments on vacated buildings and is expected to be utilized by the end of fiscal year fiscal restructuring activities we recorded net restructuring charges during fiscal year of approximately million  consisting of severance and benefits for involuntarily terminated employees of million  charges for the present value of remaining lease payments on vacated facilities of million  and the write off of related leasehold improvements of million 
we also recorded a charge of approximately million for the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in japan and million for the write off of related leasehold improvements 
furthermore  we recognized million of additional facilities related expenses due to changes in estimates of restructuring plans initiated prior to fiscal charges during the year were partially offset by recovery of million  net  of previously accrued expenses related to the remaining lease payments on vacated facilities in japan 
additional offsetting items include recovery of million due to lower than previously estimated employee severance and benefits costs and million of recovered inventory from unanticipated sales to our installed base of certain portions of inventory previously written off as part of our september restructuring 
the inventory recovery was recorded as a credit in cost of goods sold 
as a result of the fiscal restructuring activities  we expect quarterly savings  relative to the cost structure immediately preceding the activities  in total expenses of approximately million from the march plan  million from the december plan and million from the september plan 
the majority of the savings are expected to be realized within operating expenses  mainly selling  general and administrative expenses 
these estimated savings from the plans discrete actions are primarily related to lower employee payroll  facilities  and depreciation expenses 
actual savings may vary from these forecasts  depending upon future events and circumstances  such as differences in actual sublease income versus estimated amounts 
through june   we believe actual savings from these plans are largely consistent with original estimated quarterly savings 
march plan we recorded a restructuring charge during the quarter ended march  of approximately million  consisting of charges for the cancellation of a lease agreement related to one of our facilities in japan  deemed to be no longer useful to our operations  of million  and the write off of related leasehold improvements of million

although cash balances increased throughout the first three quarters of the year  interest income decreased during fiscal as a result of lower market rates 
the decline in interest expense and debt issue cost amortization in fiscal is largely due to the redemption of our million subordinated debentures notes in september during the quarter ended june   we repaid in full our notes  two years prior to maturity 
the repayment of the notes resulted in a cash outlay of million  which included a redemption premium of million 
additionally  during the same quarter  we settled the related interest rate swap agreement the swap which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our notes

as a result of the repayment of the notes and swap settlement  we recorded a net gain of million included in other income expense  net 
the million consisted of a million gain related to the swap less the million redemption premium and write off of million of unamortized offering expenses associated with the notes 

table of contents the change in net other expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the settlement of our equity derivative instruments indexed to lam stock and lower yields on investments due to declining interest rates partially offset by lower interest expense due to the redemption of our notes in september on august   we settled our outstanding equity derivative contracts by purchasing approximately million shares of lam common stock at an average price of per share for a total cash payment of million 
the settlement generated a life to date gain of million per share and we recognized an increase in treasury stock of million as a result of this transaction 
based on the market price of our common stock at the contract settlement date august   the fair value of the equity derivative contracts declined by million to million  from their june  fair value of million 
this million reduction in the equity derivative contracts fair value was recorded as a non taxable loss in other expense in fiscal tax expense benefit our annual income tax expense benefit was million  million  and million  in fiscal years   and  respectively 
the losses on equity derivative contracts indexed to our stock in fiscal years and of million and million  respectively  were non deductible for income tax purposes 
in april  the internal revenue service irs closed its examination of our tax returns for fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended june  resolution was reached on a number of issues including adjustments related to r d tax credits resulting in our recording a million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  a tax expense of approximately million associated with implementing strategies to  in the longer term  limit our tax liability on the sale of our products worldwide was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal these tax strategies are structured to align the asset ownership and functions of our various legal entities around the world  with our expectations of the level  timing  and sources of future revenues and profits 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we increased our tax benefit rate to 
the increase resulted from the tax benefit of the r d credit being proportionately greater in subsequent quarters due to lower projected pre tax income and investment in engineering and development programs qualifying for r d tax benefits 
deferred tax assets we had gross deferred tax assets arising from non deductible temporary differences  net operating losses  and tax credit carryforwards of million and million in fiscal and the gross deferred tax assets are offset by valuation allowances of million and million and deferred tax liabilities of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances  if any 
outsourcing we define aspects of our business as either core or critical capabilities and those that are in support of these activities 
we have identified as critical for success in the marketplace our ability to develop leading edge products  to market and sell what we develop  and to service and support directly what we sell 
most other activities in the company are in support of product development  marketing and selling and customer service 
consequently  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began implementation of an outsourcing strategy to obtain certain support services from third parties 
accordingly  during fiscal  we began to enter into agreements to outsource elements of our manufacturing  warehousing  logistics  facilities management and information technology functions 
during fiscal and  we continued to enter into agreements to outsource certain elements of our transactional general and administrative functions 
we believe that entering into these outsourcing programs will provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely and efficient manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business 
implementing this outsourcing strategy is intended to lead to proportionally more of our employees supporting core activities and decrease our reliance on temporary workforce during peak business cycles as well as reduce the fluctuation in employment that historically occurred due to the cyclical nature of our business 

table of contents related party transactions during fiscal year  our president and chief operating officer signed a promissory note with lam entitling him to borrow up to million dollars at simple interest 
he was advanced the million and subsequently repaid the entire amount of million  plus accrued interest  during the quarter ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain judgments  estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we based our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable  and evaluated them on an on going basis to ensure they remained reasonable under current conditions 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
some of these significant accounting polices are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  complex and or subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize all revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and we have completed our system installation obligations  received customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our installation or customer acceptance obligations 
in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
in circumstances where the practices of a customer do not provide for a written acceptance and in addition  the terms of sale do not include a lapsing acceptance provision  we recognize revenue where it can be reliably demonstrated that the delivered system meets all of the agreed to customer specifications 
in situations with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements to the customer and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations 
consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  provided the elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
revenue related to sales of spare parts  system upgrade kits  and remanufactured systems is generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services requested by a customer order 
revenue for extended maintenance service contracts with a fixed payment amount and a term more than one month is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using standard costs  which approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of title transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
when the terms of sale do not specify  we assume title transfers when we complete physical transfer of the products to the freight carrier unless other customer practices prevail 

table of contents standard costs are re assessed at least annually and reflect achievable acquisition costs  generally the most recent vendor contract prices for purchased parts  currently obtainable assembly and test labor activities  and overhead for internally manufactured products 
manufacturing labor and overhead costs are attributed to individual product standard costs at a level planned to absorb spending at average utilization volumes 
all intercompany profits related to the sales and purchases of inventory between our legal entities are eliminated from our consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory at least quarterly 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including manufacturing raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts in each reporting period 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated usage requirements over the next to months is written down to its estimated market value  if less than cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s forecasts related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  general semiconductor market conditions  possible alternative uses and ultimate realization of excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
warranty typically  marketing and selling semiconductor capital equipment includes providing parts and service warranty to customers as part of the overall price of the system 
we provide standard warranties for our systems that run generally for a period of months from system acceptance  not to exceed months from shipment of the system to the customer 
we record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system upon revenue recognition 
the amount recorded is based on an analysis of historical activity  which uses factors such as type of system  customer  geographic region  and any known factors such as tool reliability improvements 
all actual parts and labor costs incurred in subsequent periods are charged to those established reserves through the application of detailed project record keeping 
actual warranty expenses are incurred on a system by system basis  and may differ from our original estimates 
while we periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities  if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates  we may recognize adjustments to provisions in the period in which those differences arise or are identified 
accordingly  actual costs that exceed the estimates are expensed as incurred  and at the same time  additional probable and estimable liabilities may be recorded 
we do not maintain general or unspecified reserves  all warranty reserves are related to specific systems 
historically  including the most recent fiscal year ended june   all warranty obligations have been determined with reasonable estimates 
in addition to the provision of standard warranties  we offer customer paid extended warranty services 
revenues for extended maintenance and warranty services with a fixed payment amount and a term of more than one month are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
related costs are recorded either as incurred or when related liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable 
employee stock purchase plan and employee stock option plans we account for our employee stock purchase plan espp and stock option plans under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb and interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
fin and make pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
our espp is a non compensatory plan  and our stock option plans are accounted for using the intrinsic value method under the provisions of apb pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements are estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable 
in addition  the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each option 
because our stock based awards to employees have characteristics significantly different from those of traded 
table of contents options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion the existing option valuation models do not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our stock based awards to employees 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
our current valuation allowance of million relates to the tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options and foreign tax credits 
when the stock option tax benefits are realized  the related deferred tax asset will reverse and a portion of the valuation allowance will also be reversed and credited to capital in excess of par value 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have certain obligations  some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and some which are not  to make future payments under various contracts 
obligations are recorded on our balance sheet in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheet include long term liabilities and restructuring liabilities which are outlined in the following table and are discussed below 
our off balance sheet arrangements include contractual relationships and are presented as operating leases and purchase obligations in the table below 
our contractual cash obligations and commitments relating to these agreements  and our guarantees are included in the following table other long term restructuring operating purchase liabilities liabilities leases obligations total in thousands payments due by period less than year years years over years total other long term liabilities during the second quarter of fiscal we signed a final settlement agreement with varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october under the terms of the settlement agreement  varian granted us a non exclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation 
we agreed to pay varian million in cash  million in december and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of million over a three year period 
as of june   a total amount of million has been paid to varian and the total obligation remaining is million through december 
table of contents restructuring liabilities our total restructuring reserves as of june  were million  including million of severance and benefits related costs and million related to lease payments on vacated buildings 
through cash generated from operations  we expect million to be paid over the next twelve months and million to be paid between fiscal and fiscal please see the related discussion in restructuring charges within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating leases we lease most of our administrative  r d and manufacturing facilities  regional sales service offices and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases  which expire at various dates through all of our facility leases for buildings located at our fremont  california headquarters and certain other facility leases provide us with an option to extend the leases for additional periods 
certain of our facility leases provide for periodic rent increases based on the general rate of inflation 
in march and june of  lease agreements relating to properties at our fremont  california campus were transferred to a new lessor  amended  combined and restated 
as part of the lease agreements  we have the option to purchase the buildings at any time for a total purchase price for all properties related to these leases of approximately million 
in addition  we are required to guarantee the lessors a residual value on the properties of up to million at the end of the lease terms in fiscal in the case that the leases are not renewed  we do not exercise the purchase options  and the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor s costs 
at the time of the june amendment  one of the leased property s current fair value was less than its original cost by approximately million 
the leased property was a building that had been part of our past restructuring activities  and the non cash loss was recorded as a restructuring charge during fiscal as a result  we recorded a million liability for the loss on the leased property 
we maintain cash collateral of million as part of the lease agreements as of june  in separate  specified interest bearing accounts which is recorded as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet 
the lessor under the lease agreements is a substantive independent leasing company that does not have the characteristics of a variable interest entity vie as defined by fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  and is therefore not consolidated by us 
the million is included in the table above 
the remaining million primarily relates to non cancelable facility related operating leases expiring at various dates through purchase obligations purchase obligations consist of material contractual obligations either on an annual basis or over multi year periods related to our outsourcing activities or other material commitments  including vendor consigned inventories 
we continue to enter into new agreements and maintain existing agreements to outsource certain elements  including elements of our manufacturing  warehousing  logistics  facilities maintenance  certain information technology functions  and certain transactional general and administrative functions 
these outsourced services should provide us with more flexibility to scale our operations in a more timely and efficient manner to respond to the cyclical nature of our business 
the contractual cash obligations and commitments table presented above contains our minimum obligations at june  under these arrangements and others 
actual expenditures will vary based on the volume of transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition to minimum spending commitments  certain of these agreements provide for potential cancellation charges 
consignment inventories  which are owned by vendors but located in our discrete storage locations and warehouses  are not reported as lam inventory until title is transferred to us or our purchase obligation is determined 
at june   vendor owned inventories held at our locations and not reported as lam inventory were approximately million 

table of contents guarantees the transferred lease agreements relating to various properties at our fremont  california campus and discussed above under operating leases require us to guarantee residual values of the leased properties to the lessors at the end of the lease terms of up to million in the case that the leases are not renewed  we do not exercise the purchase options  the lessor sells the properties and the sale price is less than the lessor s costs 
the remaining terms of these guarantees  four years  are equal to the remaining terms of the related lease agreements 
under the accounting provisions of fin  we recognized a liability of approximately million for the related residual value guarantees under these leases 
this liability  determined by computing the present value of estimated probability weighted cash flows to be paid by us over the term of the guarantees  was recorded as prepaid rent  with the offset recorded as a liability  and the amount is being amortized to rent expense for the prepaid rent and to income for the liability on a ratable basis over the five year period of the leases 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements  included in item in this form k  for further information concerning our guaranteed residual values 
we have issued certain indemnifications to our lessors under some of our operating lease agreements  such as  indemnification for various environmental matters 
we have entered into certain insurance contracts to minimize our exposure related to such indemnifications 
as of june   we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these indemnifications  as we do not believe  based on information available  that it is probable that any amounts will be paid under these guarantees 
we have agreements with two financial institutions where our us operating company guarantees payment of our japanese subsidiary s overdraft protection obligation 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these agreements at june   is approximately million  the amount available under the overdraft protection agreement 
as of june   our japanese subsidiary did not owe any amounts under this agreement 
we have not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantees  as we do not believe  based on information available  that it is probable that any amounts will be paid 
we have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain us dollar denominated accounts receivable generated from the sale of our systems  subject to recourse provisions 
we insure these sold receivables for approximately of their value and guarantee payment of the remaining uninsured receivable value in the event that the payment obligation is not satisfied 
based on historical payment patterns  we have experienced negligible default on payment obligations and therefore  believe the risk of loss from default is minimal 
the terms of these guarantees are from days past the due date of the receivable  until collected 
at june   the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under this agreement is approximately million 
as of june   we have not recorded any liability on our financial statements in connection with these guarantees  as we do not believe  based on information available  that it is probable that any amounts will be paid 
generally  we indemnify our customers  under pre determined conditions and limitations  for infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products or services 
we seek to limit our liability for such indemnity to an amount not to exceed the sales prices of the products or services 
we do not believe  based on information available  that it is probable that any material amounts will be paid under these guarantees 
we provide standard warranties on our systems that run generally for a period of months from system acceptance  not to exceed months from the date of shipment of the system to the customer 
the liability amount is based on actual historical warranty spending activity by type of system  customer  and geographic region  modified for any known factors such as the impact of system reliability improvements 
see note of our consolidated financial statements  included in item in this form k  for changes in our product warranty reserves during fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash compared with million at june  cash provided by operating activities of million  issuance of common stock of million and reissuance of treasury stock of million resulted in net cash increases of million which enabled us to repay early our notes  which resulted in a principal payment of million 
additional significant uses of cash included capital expenditures of million 
on april   we settled our swap which had been used to minimize the impact of interest rate exposure associated with our notes 
this settlement resulted in an increase in cash of million and  in addition  a transfer of million from restricted cash to cash balances 
on june   we repaid our notes  two years prior to maturity 
this repayment resulted in a cash outlay of million  including a redemption premium of million 
additionally  we wrote off million of unamortized offering expenses 
we had a deferred gain of million recorded on the balance sheet  in long term debt and other long term liabilities  related to the swap 
as a result of the settlement of the swap and the redemption of the notes  we recorded a net gain of million included in other income  net in our statement of operations 
the net gain is comprised of the deferred gain noted above  less the redemption premium  write off of unamortized offering expenses  and transaction related costs 
during the second quarter of fiscal we signed a final settlement agreement with varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc varian in connection with the patent infringement litigation filed by varian in october under the terms of the settlement agreement  varian granted us a non exclusive license to the patents involved in the litigation 
we agreed to pay varian million in cash  million in december and the remainder to be paid in equal quarterly installments of million over a three year period 
as of june   a total amount of million has been paid to varian and the total obligation remaining is million through december cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  which consisted of net income for the year of million  adjusted for non cash charges of million and sources of working capital of million 
non cash charges include items such as depreciation and amortization  restructuring charges  deferred income taxes  and the net non cash gain recognized in fiscal as a result of the early retirement of our notes 
significant changes in assets and liabilities during fiscal year include an increase of million in accounts receivable due to increased sales volumes 
we have an agreement with a financial institution to sell certain us dollar denominated accounts receivable 
these sales of accounts receivable are intended to accelerate the collection of cash 
we sold million of accounts receivable during fiscal deferred income taxes decreased by million 
trade payables increased by million due to increased expense levels as a result of improved business volumes and timing of payments 
accrued liabilities increased by million primarily due to an increase in variable incentive based compensation as well as a rise in income taxes payable as a result of the significant increase in profits 
deferred profits for shipments not yet recognized as revenue rose by million  reflecting significantly increased rates of shipments and the timing of customer acceptances 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities during fiscal was million 
we sold million  net  of short term investments that contributed to the repayment of our notes in june  net capital expenditures were million and focused on computer equipment and machinery 
net property and equipment was million at june   compared to million at june  this decrease is primarily due to million of depreciation expense  million in write offs of leasehold improvements and certain fixed assets related to buildings that we have vacated due to restructuring activities  
table of contents million in write offs related to our decision to cease investment in cmp systems development which  together  exceed the million in capital expenditures discussed above 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used by financing activities in fiscal was million and consisted primarily of the principal repayment of our notes in the amount of million 
in connection with the settlement of our interest rate swap agreement  we received proceeds of million 
we also reissued million from treasury stock through our employee stock purchase program and net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock from stock option exercises totaled million 
given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry  we believe that maintaining sufficient liquidity reserves is important to support sustaining levels of investment in r d and capital infrastructure through ensuing business cycles 
based upon our current business outlook  our levels of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at june  are expected to be sufficient to support our presently anticipated levels of operations  investments  and capital expenditures  through at least the next months 
in the longer term  liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately size our business based on demand for our products 
should additional funding be required  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
we believe that  in the event of such requirements  we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives 
however  given the possibility of changes in market conditions or other occurrences  there can be no certainty that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 

table of contents risk factors our quarterly revenues and operating results are unpredictable our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
we manage our expense levels based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
if revenue levels in a particular quarter do not meet our expectations  our operating results may be adversely affected 
because our operating expenses are based in part on anticipated future revenues  and a certain amount of those expenses are relatively fixed  a change in the timing of recognition of revenue and or the level of gross profit from a single transaction can unfavorably affect operating results in a particular quarter 
factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate unpredictably include  but are not limited to economic conditions in the electronics and semiconductor industry generally and the equipment industry specifically  the extent that customers use our products and services in their business  timing of customer acceptances of equipment  the size and timing of orders from customers  customer cancellations or delays in our shipments  installations  and or acceptances  changes in average selling prices and product mix  our ability in a timely manner to develop  introduce and market new  enhanced and competitive products  our competitors introduction of new products  legal or technical challenges to our products and technology  changes in import export regulations  transportation  communication  demand  information technology or supply disruptions based on factors outside our control such as acts of god  wars  terrorist activities and natural disasters  legislative  tax  accounting  or regulatory changes or changes in their interpretation  procurement shortages  manufacturing difficulties  the failure of our suppliers or outsource providers to perform their obligations in a manner consistent with our expectations  new or modified accounting regulations  and exchange rate fluctuations 
further  because a significant amount of our r d and administrative operations and capacity is located at our fremont  california campus  natural  physical  logistical or other events or disruptions affecting these facilities including labor disruptions  earthquakes and power failures could adversely impact our financial performance 
we derive our revenues primarily from a relatively small number of high priced systems system sales constitute a significant portion of our total revenue 
our systems can typically range in price from approximately million to million per unit  and our revenues in any given quarter are dependent upon the acceptance of a rather limited number of such systems 
as a result  the inability to declare revenue on even a few systems can cause a significant adverse impact on our revenues for that quarter 
variations in the amount of time it takes for our customers to accept our systems may cause fluctuation in our operating results we generally recognize revenue for new system sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse 
as a result  the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new systems revenues may be subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation  which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate 

table of contents the semiconductor equipment industry is volatile and reduced product demand has a negative impact on shipments our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products using integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and historically experiences periodic downturns 
business conditions historically have changed rapidly and unpredictably 
fluctuating levels of investment by semiconductor manufacturers could continue to materially affect our aggregate shipments  revenues and operating results 
we will attempt to respond to these fluctuations with cost management programs aimed at aligning our expenditures with anticipated revenue streams  which sometimes result in restructuring charges 
even during periods of reduced revenues  we must continue to invest in research and development and maintain extensive ongoing worldwide customer service and support capabilities to remain competitive  which may temporarily harm our financial results 
we depend on new products and processes for our success 
consequently  we are subject to risks associated with rapid technological change rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances enabling such processes 
we believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products 
if new products have reliability or quality problems  our performance may be impacted by reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in acceptance of and payment for new products  and additional service and warranty expenses 
we may be unable to develop and manufacture new products successfully  or new products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace 
our failure to complete commercialization of these new products in a timely manner could result in unanticipated costs and inventory obsolescence  which would adversely affect our financial results 
in order to develop new products and processes  we expect to continue to make significant investments in r d and to pursue joint development relationships with customers  suppliers or other members of the industry 
we must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully  as introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products 
future technologies  processes or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete  leaving us with non competitive products  or obsolete inventory  or both 
we are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of product revenue diversification we derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products  and we expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term 
continued market acceptance of our primary products is  therefore  critical to our future success 
our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows could therefore be adversely affected by a decline in demand for even a limited number of our products  a failure to achieve continued market acceptance of our key products  an improved version of products being offered by a competitor in the market we participate in  technological change that we are unable to address with our products  and a failure to release new enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis 
we have a limited number of key customers sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue 
as a result  the actions of even one customer may subject us to revenue swings that are difficult to predict 
similarly  significant portions of our credit risk may  at any given time  be concentrated among a limited number of customers  so that the failure of even one of these key customers to pay its obligations to us could significantly impact our financial results 

table of contents we are dependent upon a limited number of key suppliers we obtain certain components and sub assemblies included in our products from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
we have established long term contracts with many of these suppliers 
these long term contracts can take a variety of forms 
we may renew these contracts periodically 
in some cases  these suppliers sold us products during at least the last four years  and we expect that we will continue to renew these contracts in the future or that we will otherwise replace them with competent alternative suppliers 
however  several of our outsourced assembly suppliers are new providers to us so that our experience with them and their performance is limited 
where practical  our intent is to establish alternative sources to mitigate the risk that the failure of any single supplier will adversely affect our business 
nevertheless  a prolonged inability to obtain certain components could impair our ability to ship products  lower our revenues and thus adversely affect our operating results and result in damage to our customer relationships 
our outsource providers may fail to perform as we expect outsource providers have played and will play key roles in our manufacturing operations and in many of our transactional and administrative functions 
although we aim at selecting reputable providers and secure their performance on terms documented in written contracts  it is possible that one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect and such failure could have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition  the expansive role of outsource providers has required and will continue to require us to implement changes to our existing operations and to adopt new procedures to deal with and manage the performance of these outsource providers 
any delay or failure in the implementation of our operational changes and new procedures could adversely affect our customer relationships and or have a negative effect on our operating results 
once a semiconductor manufacturer commits to purchase a competitor s semiconductor manufacturing equipment  the manufacturer typically continues to purchase that competitor s equipment  making it more difficult for us to sell our equipment to that customer semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line 
we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier s processing equipment  the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application 
accordingly  we expect it to be more difficult to sell to a given customer if that customer initially selects a competitor s equipment 
we are subject to risks associated with our competitors strategic relationships and their introduction of new products and we may lack the financial resources or technological capabilities of certain of our competitors needed to capture increased market share we expect to face significant competition from multiple current and future competitors 
we believe that other companies are developing systems and products that are competitive to ours and are planning to introduce new products  which may affect our ability to sell our existing products 
we face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop  as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers 
we believe that to remain competitive we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products  to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide  and to invest in product and process r d 
certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to increasingly dominate the semiconductor equipment industry 
these competitors may deeply discount or give away products similar to those that we sell  challenging or even exceeding our ability to make similar accommodations and threatening our ability to sell those products 
for these reasons  we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide 
in addition  our competitors may provide innovative technology that may have performance advantages over systems we currently  or expect to  offer 
they may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
in particular  while we currently are developing additional product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements  we 
table of contents may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully  or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive 
accordingly  we may be unable to continue to compete in our markets  competition may intensify  or future competition may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  operating results  financial condition  and or cash flows 
our future success depends on international sales and the management of global operations non us sales  as a percentage of total revenue  accounted for approximately in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue in future years 
we are subject to various challenges related to the management of global operations  and international sales are subject to risks including  but not limited to trade balance issues  regional economic and political conditions  changes in currency controls  differences in the enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in varying jurisdictions  ability to develop relationships with local suppliers  compliance with us and international laws and regulations  including us export restrictions  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  and the need for technical support resources in different locations 
many of these challenges are applicable in china  which is a fast developing market for the semiconductor equipment industry and therefore an area of potential significant growth for our business 
as the business volume between china and the rest of the world grows  there is inherent risk  based on the complex relationships between china  taiwan and the united states  that political and diplomatic influences might lead to trade disruptions which would adversely affect our business with china and or taiwan and perhaps the entire asia pacific region 
a significant trade disruption in these areas could have a material  adverse impact on our future revenue and profits 
we currently enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of exchange rate fluctuations on japanese yen denominated assets and will continue to enter into hedging transactions for the purposes outlined in the foreseeable future 
a failure to comply with environmental regulations may adversely affect our operating results we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals 
we believe that we are in general compliance with these regulations and that we have obtained or will obtain or are otherwise addressing all necessary environmental permits to conduct our business 
these permits generally relate to the disposal of hazardous wastes 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production  cessation of our operations or reduction in our customers acceptance of our products 
these regulations could require us to alter our current operations  to acquire significant equipment or to incur substantial other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
our failure to control the use  sale  transport or disposal of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities 
if we are unable to adjust the scale of our business in response to rapid changes in demand in the semiconductor equipment industry  our operating results and our ability to compete successfully may be impaired the business cycle in the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by frequent periods of rapid change in demand that challenge our management to adjust spending on operating activities 
during periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services  we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls  management processes  information systems and procedures and in training  managing  and appropriately sizing our work force and other components of our business on a timely basis 
our success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively 
if we do not adequately meet these challenges  our gross margins and earnings may be impaired during periods of demand decline  and we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to 
table of contents meet customer expectations and compete successfully during periods of demand growth 
if we choose to acquire or dispose of product lines and technologies  we may encounter unforeseen costs and difficulties that could impair our financial performance an important element of our management strategy is to review acquisition prospects that would complement our existing products  augment our market coverage and distribution ability  or enhance our technological capabilities 
as a result  we may make acquisitions of complementary companies  products or technologies  or we may reduce or dispose of certain product lines or technologies  which no longer fit our long term strategies 
managing an acquired business  disposing of product technologies or reducing personnel entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel or separating existing business or product groups  diversion of management s attention away from other business concerns  amortization of acquired intangible assets and potential loss of key employees or customers of acquired or disposed operations among others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and manage successfully any such integration of potential acquisitions  disposition of product lines or technologies  or reduction in personnel or that our management  personnel  or systems will be adequate to support continued operations 
any such inabilities or inadequacies could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
in addition  any acquisitions could result in changes such as potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  the amortization of related intangible assets  and goodwill impairment charges  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations and or the price of our common stock 
the market for our common stock is extremely volatile  which may affect our ability to raise capital or make acquisitions the market price for our common stock is extremely volatile and has fluctuated significantly over the past years 
the trading price of our common stock could continue to be highly volatile and fluctuate widely in response to factors  including but not limited to the following general market  semiconductor  or semiconductor equipment industry conditions  global economic fluctuations  variations in our quarterly operating results  variations in our revenues or earnings from levels that securities analysts forecast  announcements of restructurings  technological innovations  reductions in force  departure of key employees  consolidations of operations  or introduction of new products  government regulations  developments in  or claims relating to  patent or other proprietary rights  success or failure of our new and existing products  disruptions with key customers or suppliers  or political  economic  or environmental events occurring globally or in any of our key sales regions 
in addition  the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations 
historically  we have witnessed significant volatility in the price of our common stock due in part to the actual or anticipated movement in interest rates and the price of and markets for semiconductors 
these broad market and industry factors have and may again adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  following volatile periods in the price of stock  many companies became the object of securities class action litigation 
if we are sued in a securities class action  we could incur substantial costs  and it could divert management s attention and resources and have an unfavorable impact on the price for our common stock 

table of contents we rely upon certain critical information systems for the operation of our business we maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business 
these information systems include telecommunications  the internet  our corporate intranet  various computer hardware and software applications  network communications  and e mail 
these information systems may be owned by us or by our outsource providers or even third parties such as vendors and contractors and may be maintained by us or by such providers and third parties 
these information systems are subject to attacks  failures  and access denials from a number of potential sources including viruses  destructive or inadequate code  power failures  and physical damage to computers  hard drives  communication lines  and networking equipment 
to the extent that these information systems are under our control  we have implemented security procedures  such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes  to address the outlined risks  however  security procedures for information systems cannot be guaranteed to be failsafe and our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timely and efficient operation of our business 
the potential anti takeover effects of our bylaws provisions and the rights plan we have in place may affect our stock price and inhibit a change of control desired by some of our stockholders in  we adopted a rights plan the rights plan in which rights were distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of our common stock  held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on january   and thereafter 
in connection with the adoption of the rights plan  our board of directors also adopted a number of amendments to our bylaws  including amendments requiring advance notice of stockholder nominations of directors and stockholder proposals 
our rights plan may have certain anti takeover effects 
our rights plan will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire lam in certain circumstances 
accordingly  the existence of the rights plan and the issuance of the related rights may deter certain acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers 
the rights plan  however  is not intended to prevent a takeover 
rather it is designed to enhance the ability of our board of directors to negotiate with a potential acquirer on behalf of all of our stockholders 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes issuance of  shares of undesignated preferred stock 
our board of directors  without further stockholder approval  may issue this preferred stock on such terms as the board of directors may determine  which also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of lam 
the issuance of preferred stock could also adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock  including causing the loss of voting control 
moreover  section of the delaware general corporation law restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders  as defined by that statute 
intellectual property and other claims against us can be costly and could result in the loss of significant rights which are necessary to our continued business and profitability third parties may assert infringement  unfair competition or other claims against us 
from time to time  other parties send us notices alleging that our products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
in addition  our bylaws and indemnity obligations provide that we will indemnify officers and directors against losses that they may incur in legal proceedings resulting from their service to lam 
in such cases  it is our policy either to defend the claims or to negotiate licenses or other settlements on commercially reasonable terms 
however  we may be unable in the future to negotiate necessary licenses or reach agreement on other settlements on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and any litigation resulting from these claims by other parties may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 

table of contents we may fail to protect our proprietary technology rights  which would affect our business our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
while we attempt to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secret protection  we believe that our success also depends on increasing our technological expertise  continuing our development of new systems  increasing market penetration and growth of our installed base  and providing comprehensive support and service to our customers 
however  we may be unable to protect our technology in all instances  or our competitors may develop similar or more competitive technology independently 
we currently hold a number of united states and foreign patents and pending patent applications 
however  other parties may challenge or attempt to invalidate or circumvent any patents the united states or foreign governments issue to us or these governments may fail to issue patents for pending applications 
in addition  the rights granted or anticipated under any of these patents or pending patent applications may be narrower than we expect or  in fact provide no competitive advantages 
compliance with internal control attestation and outside audit firm independence pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we will be required  beginning with our fiscal year ending june   to include in our annual report our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our audited financial statements as of the end of fiscal furthermore  our independent registered public accounting firm firm will be required to attest to whether our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is fairly stated in all material respects and separately report on whether it believes we maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of june  we have not yet completed our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control 
if we fail to timely complete this assessment  or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot timely attest to our assessment  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and a loss of public confidence in our internal control 
in addition  any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations 
our independent registered public accounting firm communicates with us at least annually regarding any relationships between the firm and the company that  in the firm s professional judgment  might have a bearing on the firm s independence with respect to the company 
if  for whatever reason  our independent registered public accounting firm finds that it cannot confirm that it is independent of the company based on existing securities laws and registered public accounting firm independence standards  we could experience delays or other failures to meet our regulatory reporting obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
we maintain a conservative investment policy  which focuses on the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio  long term assets and long term debt obligations at june  and june  june  june  there fair after total value total in thousands cash equivalents fixed rate average rate short term investments fixed rate average rate auction rate preferreds variable rate average rate restricted cash fixed rate average rate total investment securities average rate long term debt fixed rate average rate we mitigate default risk by investing in high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to achieve portfolio liquidity and maintain a prudent amount of diversification 
we had no foreign exchange cash flow exposure related to our fixed rate notes 
we conduct business on a global basis in several major international currencies 
as such  we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
for this reason  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the value of our japanese yen denominated assets 
the changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded in other income and expense 
in addition  we periodically hedge anticipated cash flow transactions with foreign currency forward contracts 
we defer the gains and losses on these contracts and recognize them in income during the same period as the hedged transaction is recognized in income 
on june   the notional amount of outstanding japanese yen forward contracts that are designated as balance sheet hedges was million 
the unrealized gain on the contracts on june   was million 
a appreciation of the japanese yen would result in an unrealized loss of million 
depreciation in the exchange rate of the japanese yen of approximately would result in an unrealized gain of million
