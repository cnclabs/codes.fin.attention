item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more detailed discussion of ebitda  as adjusted were attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season from october through march  as many customers use propane for heating purposes 
consequently  sales and operating profits are normally concentrated in the first and second fiscal quarters  while cash flows from operations are generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak season 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from peak periods for distribution to unitholders during the warmer seasons 
typically  customer service locations are found in suburban and rural areas where natural gas is not readily available 
generally  such locations consist of a one to two acre parcel of land  an office  a small warehouse and service facility  a dispenser and one or more  to  gallon storage tanks 
propane is generally transported from refineries  pipeline terminals  leased storage facilities and coastal terminals by rail or truck transports to our customer service locations where it is unloaded into storage tanks 
in order to make a retail delivery of propane to a 
table of contents customer  a bobtail truck is loaded with propane from the storage tank 
propane is then delivered to the customer by the bobtail truck  which generally holds  to  gallons of propane  and pumped into a stationary storage tank on the customer s premises 
the capacity of these customer tanks ranges from approximately gallons to  gallons  with a typical tank capacity of to gallons in milder climates and from to  gallons in colder climates 
we also deliver propane to retail customers in portable cylinders  which typically have a capacity of to gallons 
when these cylinders are delivered to customers  empty cylinders are picked up for refilling at our distribution locations or are refilled on site 
we also deliver propane to certain other bulk end users of propane in tractor trailer transports  which typically have an average capacity of approximately  gallons 
end users receiving transport deliveries include industrial customers  large scale heating accounts  mining operations and large agricultural accounts 
we encourage our customers whose propane needs are temperature sensitive to implement a regular delivery schedule 
many of our residential customers receive their propane supply pursuant to an automatic delivery system  which eliminates the customer s need to make an affirmative purchase decision and allows for more efficient route scheduling 
we also sell  install and service equipment related to our propane distribution business  including heating and cooking appliances 
we own  through our subsidiaries  a interest in m p energy partnership  a canadian partnership that supplies us with propane as described below under propane supply and storage 
approximately of the domestic gallons we sold in the fiscal year ended august  were to retail customers and were to wholesale customers 
of the retail gallons we sold  approximately were to residential customers  were to industrial  commercial and agricultural customers  and were to other retail users 
sales to residential customers in the fiscal year ended august  accounted for of total domestic gallons sold but accounted for approximately of our gross profit from propane sales 
residential sales have a greater profit margin and a more stable customer base than the other markets we serve 
industrial  commercial and agricultural sales accounted for of our gross profit from propane sales for the fiscal year ended august   with all other retail users accounting for 
additional volumes sold to wholesale customers contributed of our gross profit from propane sales 
no single customer accounts for or more of revenues 
these figures are on a aggregate basis  which includes the historical figures of the operations of holp from the period from september  through august  the propane business is very seasonal with weather conditions significantly affecting demand for propane 
we believe that the geographic diversity of our operations helps to reduce our overall exposure to less than favorable weather conditions in any particular region of the united states 
although overall demand for propane is affected by climate  changes in price and other factors  we believe our residential and commercial business to be relatively stable due to the following characteristics residential and commercial demand for propane has been relatively unaffected by general economic conditions due to the largely non discretionary nature of most propane purchases  loss of customers to competing energy sources has been low due to the lack of availability or the high cost of alternative fuels  the tendency of our customers to remain with us due to the product being delivered pursuant to a regular delivery schedule and to our ownership as of august  of of the storage tanks utilized by our customers  which prevents fuel deliveries from competitors  and our historic ability to more than offset customer losses through internal growth of our customer base in existing markets 
since home heating usage is the most sensitive to temperature  residential customers account for the greatest usage variation due to weather 
variations in the weather in one or more regions in which we operate can significantly affect the total volumes of propane that we sell and the margins realized thereon and  consequently  our results of operations 
we believe that sales to the commercial and industrial markets  while affected by economic patterns  are not as sensitive to variations in weather conditions as sales to residential and agricultural markets 
propane supply and storage 
table of contents supplies of propane from our sources historically have been readily available 
we purchase from over energy companies and natural gas processors at numerous supply points located in the united states and canada 
in the fiscal year ended august   enterprise products operating lp enterprise and dynegy liquids marketing and trade dynegy provided approximately and of ours and heritage s combined total propane supply  respectively 
in addition  m p energy partnership  a canadian partnership in which our wholly owned subsidiary mp oils  ltd 
owns a interest in  procured of heritage s combined total propane supply during the fiscal year ended august  m p energy partnership buys and sells propane for its own account and supplies propane to us for our northern united states operations 
we believe that if supplies from enterprise and dynegy were interrupted we would be able to secure adequate propane supplies from other sources without a material disruption of our operations 
aside from enterprise  dynegy and the supply procured by m p energy partnership  no still true single supplier provided more than of our total domestic propane supply during the fiscal year ended august  we believe that our diversification of suppliers will enable us to purchase all of our supply needs at market prices without a material disruption of our operations if supplies are interrupted from any of our existing sources 
although no assurances can be given that supplies of propane will be readily available in the future  we expect a sufficient supply to continue to be available 
however  increased demand for propane in periods of severe cold weather  or otherwise  could cause future propane supply interruptions or significant volatility in the price of propane 
we typically enter into one year supply agreements 
the percentage of contract purchases may vary from year to year 
supply contracts generally provide for pricing in accordance with posted prices at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery or storage points  and some contracts include a pricing formula that typically is based on these market prices 
most of these agreements provide maximum and minimum seasonal purchase guidelines 
we receive our supply of propane predominately through railroad tank cars and common carrier transport 
because our profitability is sensitive to changes in wholesale propane costs  we generally seek to pass on increases in the cost of propane to customers 
we have generally been successful in maintaining retail gross margins on an annual basis despite changes in the wholesale cost of propane  but there is no assurance that we will always be able to pass on product cost increases fully  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
consequently  our profitability will be sensitive to changes in wholesale propane prices 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
we lease space in larger storage facilities in new york  georgia  michigan  south carolina  arizona  new mexico  texas  alberta  canada and smaller storage facilities in other locations and have the opportunity to use storage facilities in additional locations when we pre buy product from sources having such facilities 
we believe that we have adequate third party storage to take advantage of supply purchasing advantages as they may occur from time to time 
access to storage facilities allows us to buy and store large quantities of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  or at favorable prices  thereby helping to ensure a more secure supply of propane during periods of intense demand or price instability 
pricing policy pricing policy is an essential element in the marketing of propane 
we rely on regional management to set prices based on prevailing market conditions and product cost  as well as local management input 
all regional managers are advised regularly of any changes in the posted price of each customer service location s propane suppliers 
in most situations  we believe that our pricing methods will permit us to respond to changes in supply costs in a manner that protects our gross margins and customer base  to the extent such protection is possible 
in some cases  however  our ability to respond quickly to cost increases could occasionally cause our retail prices to rise more rapidly than those of our competitors  possibly resulting in a loss of customers 
billing and collection procedures customer billing and account collection responsibilities for our propane operations are retained at the local customer service locations 
we believe that this decentralized approach is beneficial for several reasons the customer is billed on a timely basis  
table of contents the customer is more apt to pay a local business  cash payments are received more quickly  and local personnel have a current account status available to them at all times to answer customer inquiries 
our propane distribution business is largely seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in its service areas 
propane sales to residential and commercial customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and  in some cases  net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september of each year 
sales to industrial and agricultural customers are much less weather sensitive 
gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns but also by changes in customer mix 
for example  sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
wholesale margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  gross profit margins vary by geographic region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
government regulation and environmental matters the operation of pipelines  plants and other facilities for gathering  compressing  treating  processing  or transporting natural gas  natural gas liquids and other products is subject to stringent and complex federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to release of hazardous contaminants into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations can restrict or prohibit our business activities that affect the environment in many ways  such as restricting the way we can release materials or waste products into the air  water  or soils  limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands or areas of endangered species habitat  or otherwise constraining how or when construction is conducted  requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution from former operations  or requiring plans and activities to prevent pollution from ongoing operations  and imposing substantial liabilities on us for pollution resulting from our operations  including  for example  potentially enjoining the operations of facilities if it were determined that they were not in compliance with permit terms 
in most instances  the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the potential release of substances or waste products into the air  water or soils and include measures to control or prevent the release of substances or waste products to the environment 
costs of planning  designing  constructing and operating pipelines  plants and other facilities must incorporate compliance with environmental laws and regulations and safety standards 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  which can include the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements  the issuance of injunctions and federally authorized citizen suits 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of substances or other waste products to the environment 
the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and thus  there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation  and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate 
moreover  risks of process upsets  accidental releases or spills are associated with our operations  and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such upsets  releases  or spills  including those relating to claims for damage to property and persons 
in the event of future increases in costs  we may not be able to pass on those increases to our customers 
we will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly in order to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 

table of contents the following is a discussion of certain environmental and safety concerns that relate to the midstream natural gas and ngls industry 
it is not intended to constitute a complete discussion of all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations  or specific matters  to which etc olp may be subject 
our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern emissions of pollutants into the air resulting from our activities  for example in relation to our processing plants and our compressor stations  and also impose procedural requirements on how we conducts our operations 
such laws and regulations may include requirements that we obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions  strictly comply with the emissions and operational limitations of air emissions permits we are required to obtain  or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 
failure to comply with these requirements exposes us to civil enforcement actions from the state agencies and perhaps the epa  including monetary penalties  injunctions  conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions or federally authorized citizen suits 
our operations generate wastes  including some hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws 
however  rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste 
specifically  rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development  or production of crude oil  natural gas or geothermal energy 
unrecovered petroleum product wastes  however  may still be regulated under rcra as solid waste 
moreover  ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes  waste solvents  laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils  may be regulated as hazardous waste 
the transportation of natural gas and ngls in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes 
although we believe it is unlikely that the rcra exemption will be repealed in the near future  repeal would increase costs for waste disposal and environmental remediation at our facilities 
our operations could incur liability under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla and comparable state laws regardless of our fault  in connection with the disposal or other release of hazardous substances or wastes  including those arising out of historical operations conducted by our predecessors 
although petroleum as well as natural gas and ngls are excluded from cercla s definition of hazardous substance  in the course of its ordinary operations we will generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
cercla authorizes the environmental protection agency the epa and  in some cases  third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other wastes released into the environment 
if we were to incur liability under cercla  we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
we currently own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  numerous properties that for many years have been used for the measurement  gathering  field compression and processing of natural gas and ngls 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators or property contamination including groundwater contamination  whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills or to perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination  in some instances regardless of fault or the amount of waste we sent to the site 
for example  we are currently involved in several remediation operations in which our cost for cleanup and related liabilities is estimated to be between million and million in the aggregate 
however  with respect to one of the remedial projects  we expect to recover approximately million to million of these estimated cleanup costs pursuant to a contractual requirement that makes a predecessor owner responsible for environmental liabilities 
we have established environmental accruals totaling approximately million as of august  to address environmental conditions and related liabilities including costs for cleanup and remediation of properties 

table of contents our operations can result in discharges of pollutants to waters 
the federal water pollution control act of  as amended fwpca  also known as the clean water act  and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the united states 
the unpermitted discharge of pollutants such as from spill or leak incidents is prohibited 
the fwpca and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of fill material and certain other activities in wetlands unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 
any unpermitted release of pollutants  including ngls or condensates  from our systems or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations 
we currently expect to incur costs of approximately million over the next year to make spill prevention upgrades or modifications at certain of its facilities as required under its recently updated spill prevention controls and countermeasures or spcc plans 
our operations are subject to regulation by the us department of transportation the dot under the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act  or hlpsa  pursuant to which the dot has established requirements relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of pipeline facilities 
the hlpsa covers crude oil  carbon dioxide  ngl and petroleum products pipelines and requires any entity which owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with the regulations under the hlpsa  to permit access to and allow copying of records and to make certain reports and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
we believe that our pipeline operations are in substantial compliance with applicable hlpsa requirements  however  due to the possibility of new or amended laws and regulations or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that future compliance with the hlpsa will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial positions 
currently  the department of transportation  through the office of pipeline safety  is in the midst of promulgating a series of rules intended to require pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for gas transmission pipelines that  in the event of a failure  could impact high consequence areas 
high consequence areas are currently defined as areas with specified population densities  buildings containing populations of limited mobility and areas where people gather that occur along the route of a pipeline 
similar rules are already in place for operators of hazardous liquid pipelines  which are also applicable to etc olp s pipelines in certain instances 
the office of pipeline safety has yet to publish a final rule requiring gas pipeline operators to develop integrity management plans  but it is expected that a rule will eventually be finalized 
compliance with such rule  or rules  when finalized  could result in increased operating costs that  at this time  cannot reasonably be quantified 
we are subject to the requirements of the occupational safety and health act  referred to as osha  and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens 
etc olp believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with the osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances 
we do not believe that compliance with federal  state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
in addition  we believe that the various environmental activities in which we are presently engaged are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather  compress  treat  process and transport natural gas and ngls 
we cannot assure you  however  that future events  such as changes in existing laws  the promulgation of new laws  or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs 
holp is subject to various federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
generally  these laws impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants and establish standards for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes 
these laws include  without limitation  rcra  cercla  the clean air act  the occupational safety and health act  the emergency planning and community right to know act  the clean water act and comparable state statutes 
cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes joint and several liability in most instances  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
propane is not a hazardous substance within the meaning of cercla 
however  certain automotive waste products generated by our truck fleet  as well as hazardous substances or hazardous waste disposed of during past operations by third parties on our properties  could subject us to liability under cercla 
such laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties in cases of non compliance and impose liability for remediation costs 
in 
table of contents addition  third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances or waste 
in connection with all acquisitions of retail propane businesses that involve the acquisition of any interests in real estate  we conduct an environmental review in an attempt to determine whether any substance other than propane has been sold from  or stored on  any such real estate prior to its purchase 
such review includes questioning the seller  obtaining representations and warranties concerning the seller s compliance with environmental laws and conducting inspections of the properties 
where warranted  independent environmental consulting firms are hired to look for evidence of hazardous substances or the existence of underground storage tanks 
petroleum based contamination or environmental wastes are known to be located on or adjacent to six sites  which we presently have or which we or our predecessors formerly had operations 
these sites were evaluated at the time of their acquisition 
in all cases  remediation operations have been or will be undertaken by others  and in all six cases  we obtained indemnification for expenses associated with any remediation from the former owners or related entities 
we have not been named as a potentially responsible party at any of these sites  nor have our operations contributed to the environmental issues at these sites 
accordingly  no amounts have been recorded in our august  consolidated balance sheets for any liability that may be attributable to any required remediation 
based on information currently available to us  such projects are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  heritage acquired a company that had previously received a request for information from the epa regarding potential contribution to a widespread groundwater contamination problem in san bernardino  california  known as the newmark groundwater contamination 
although the epa has indicated that the groundwater contamination may be attributable to releases of solvents from a former military base located within the subject area that occurred long before the facility acquired by us was constructed  it is possible that the epa may seek to recover all or a portion of groundwater remediation costs from private parties under cercla 
based upon information currently available to us  it is not believed that our liability  if such action were to be taken by the epa  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
national fire protection association pamphlets no 
and no 
 which establish rules and procedures governing the safe handling of propane  or comparable regulations  have been adopted as the industry standard in all of the states in which we operate 
in some states these laws are administered by state agencies  and in others they are administered on a municipal level 
with respect to the transportation of propane by truck  we are subject to regulations promulgated under the federal motor carrier safety act 
these regulations cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered by the united states department of transportation 
we conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations 
we maintain various permits that are necessary to operate our facilities  some of which may be material to our operations 
we believe that the procedures currently in effect at all of our facilities for the handling  storage  and distribution of propane are consistent with industry standards and are in compliance in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations 
we have implemented environmental programs and policies designed to avoid potential liability and cost under applicable environmental laws 
it is possible  however  that we will have increased costs due to stricter pollution control requirements or liabilities resulting from non compliance with operating or other regulatory permits 
it is not anticipated that our compliance with or liabilities under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including cercla  will have a material adverse effect on us 
to the extent that there are any environmental liabilities unknown to us or environmental  health and safety laws or regulations are made more stringent  there can be no assurance that our results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected 
employees to carry out our operations for the midstream and transportation segments  we employ people as of october  as of october   our propane operations had  full time employees  of whom were general and administrative and  were operational employees 
of our operational employees  are represented by labor unions 
we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
historically  heritage has also hired seasonal workers to meet peak winter demands in our propane operations

item properties substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights of way granted by the apparent record owners of the property 
lands over which pipeline rights of way have been obtained may be subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right of way grants 
we have obtained  where necessary  easement agreements from public authorities and railroad companies to cross over or under  or to lay facilities in or along  watercourses  county roads  municipal streets  railroad properties and state highways  as applicable 
in some cases  property on which our pipeline was built was purchased in fee 
some of the leases  easements  rights of way  permits  licenses and franchise ordinances that will be transferred to us will require the consent of the current landowner to transfer these rights  which in some instances is a governmental entity 
we believe that we have obtained or will obtain sufficient third party consents  permits and authorizations for the transfer of the assets necessary for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this prospectus supplement 
with respect to any consents  permits or authorizations that have not been obtained  we believe that these consents  permits or authorizations will be obtained  or that the failure to obtain these consents  permits or authorizations will have no material adverse effect on the operation of our business 
we own an office building with  square feet of space for our executive offices in dallas  texas 
we also lease office facilities in san antonio  texas  tulsa  oklahoma  and helena  montana  which consist of  square feet   square feet  and  square feet  respectively 
while we may require additional office space as our business expands  we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet its needs for the immediate future  and that additional facilities will be available on commercially reasonable terms as needed 
we are currently in negotiations to replace our leased facility in helena  montana  which is for the administration of our propane operations  with a new building that we anticipate owning 
we operate bulk storage facilities at over customer service locations for our propane operations 
we own substantially all of these facilities and have entered into long term leases for those that we do not own 
we believe that the increasing difficulty associated with obtaining permits for new propane distribution locations makes our high level of site ownership and control a competitive advantage 
we own approximately million gallons of above ground storage capacity at our various propane plant sites and have leased an aggregate of approximately million gallons of underground storage facilities in new york  georgia  michigan  south carolina  arizona  new mexico  texas and alberta  canada 
we do not own or operate any underground propane storage facilities excluding customer and local distribution tanks or propane pipeline transportation assets other than local delivery systems 
prior to january  heritage owned a interest in bi state propane  a california general partnership that conducts business in california and nevada 
in january  heritage s subsidiary  heritage bi state  llc  acquired of the assets of bi state propane  and we conduct those operations under the tradename bi state propane 
the transportation of propane requires specialized equipment 
the trucks and railroad tank cars used for 
table of contents this purpose carry specialized steel tanks that maintain the propane in a liquefied state 
as of august   we utilized approximately transport truck tractors  transport trailers  railroad tank cars   bobtails and  other delivery and service vehicles  all of which we own 
as of august   we owned approximately  customer storage tanks with typical capacities of to  gallons that are leased or available for lease to customers 
these customer storage tanks are pledged as collateral to secure our obligations to our banks and the holders of our notes 
we utilize a variety of trademarks and tradenames in our propane operations that we own or have secured the right to use  including heritage propane 
these trademarks and tradenames have been registered or are pending registration before the united states patent and trademark office or the various jurisdictions in which the marks or tradenames are used 
we believe that our strategy of retaining the names of the companies we have acquired has maintained the local identification of these companies and has been important to the continued success of these businesses 
some of our most significant trade names include balgas  bi state propane  blue flame gas of charleston  blue flame gas of mt 
pleasant  blue flame gas  carolane propane gas  gas service company  energynorth propane  gibson propane  guilford gas  holton s lp gas  ikard newsom  northern energy  sawyer gas  proflame  rural bottled gas and appliance  servigas  and v propane 
we regard our trademarks  tradenames and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in the marketing of our products 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to or valid rights to use all of our material properties 
although some of such properties are subject to liabilities and leases  liens for taxes not yet due and payable  encumbrances securing payment obligations under non competition agreements and immaterial encumbrances  easements and restrictions  we do not believe that any such burdens will materially interfere with our continued use of such properties in our business  taken as a whole 
in addition  we believe that we have  or are in the process of obtaining  all required material approvals  authorizations  orders  licenses  permits  franchises and consents of  and have obtained or made all required material registrations  qualifications and filings with  the various state and local government and regulatory authorities which relate to ownership of our properties or the operations of our business 
item legal proceedings 
although our midstream operating partnership  etc olp  may  from time to time  be involved in litigation and claims arising out of its operations in the normal course of business  etc olp is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings 
in addition  we are not aware of any material legal or governmental proceedings against etc olp  or contemplated to be brought against etc olp  under the various environmental protection statutes to which it is subject 
propane is a flammable  combustible gas 
serious personal injury and significant property damage can arise in connection with its storage  transportation or use 
in the ordinary course of business  we are sometimes threatened with or are named as a defendant in various lawsuits seeking actual and punitive damages for product liability  personal injury and property damage 
we maintain liability insurance with insurers in amounts and with coverages and deductibles we believe are reasonable and prudent  and which are generally accepted in the industry 
however  there can be no assurance that the levels of insurance protection currently in effect will continue to be available at reasonable prices or that such levels will remain adequate to protect us from material expenses related to product liability  personal injury or property damage in the future 
although any litigation is inherently uncertain  based on past experience  the information currently available and the availability of insurance coverage  we do not believe that pending or threatened litigation matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
of the pending or threatened matters in which we are a party  none have arisen outside the ordinary course of business except for an action filed by heritage on november  against scana corporation  cornerstone ventures  lp and suburban propane  lp in the fifth judicial circuit court of common pleas  richland county  south carolina the scana litigation 
prior to trial  a settlement was reached with defendant cornerstone ventures  lp and they were dismissed from the litigation 
the trial began on october  against the remaining defendants and testimony was concluded on october  on october   the jury returned a verdict in favor of heritage against scana and in favor of defendant suburban 
the jury found in favor of heritage on all four claims against scana  awarding a total of million in actual and punitive damages 
it is expected that the 
table of contents court will render a final judgment by the end of november scana has publicly stated that it plans to appeal any adverse judgment by the court 
we cannot predict whether the final judgment will affirm the jury verdict without any modification or whether any appeal of the final judgment by scana will be successful 
as a result  we cannot yet predict whether we will receive any of the damages award covered by this verdict 
the partnership is a party to various legal proceedings and or regulatory proceedings incidental to its business 
certain claims  suits and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business have been filed or are pending against the partnership 
in the opinion of management  all such matters are either covered by insurance  are without merit or involve amounts  which  if resolved unfavorably  would not have a significant effect on the financial position or results of operations of the partnership 
once management determines that information pertaining to a legal proceeding indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred  an accrual is established equal to management s estimate of the likely exposure 
for matters that are covered by insurance  the partnership accrues the related deductible 
as of august  and  an accrual of and  respectively  was recorded as accrued and other current liabilities on the partnership s consolidated balance sheets

description of units as of september   there were approximately  individual common unitholders  which includes common units held in street name 
common units and class c units represent limited partner interest in the name never changed any explanation needed partnership s amended and restated agreement of limited partnership the partnership agreement that entitle the holders to the rights and privileges specified in the partnership agreement 
as of august   we had  common units outstanding  of which  were held by the public   were held by la grange energy or its affiliates  and  were held by our officers and directors 
as of such date  the common units represent an aggregate limited partner interest in the partnership 
our general partner owns an aggregate general partner interest in the partnership 
common units 
our common units are registered under the securities exchange act of and are listed for trading on the new york stock exchange the nyse 
each holder of a common unit is entitled to one vote per unit on all matters presented to the limited partners for a vote 
in addition  if at any time any person or group other than our general partner and its affiliates owns beneficially or more of all common units  any common units owned by that person or group may not be voted on any matter and are not considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders unless otherwise required by law  calculating required votes  determining the presence of a quorum or for other similar purposes under our partnership agreement 
the common units are entitled to distributions of available cash as described below under cash distribution policy 
class c units 
in conjunction with the transaction with us propane and the change of control of our general partner in august  we issued  newly created class c units to heritage holdings in conversion of that portion of its incentive distribution rights that entitled it to receive any distribution attributable to the net amount received by us in connection with the settlement  judgment  award or other final nonappealable resolution of specified litigation filed by us prior to the transaction with us propane  which we refer to as the scana litigation 
the class c units have a zero initial capital account balance and were distributed by heritage holdings to its former stockholders in connection with the transaction with us propane 
on october   we announced that heritage received a favorable jury verdict with respect to the scana litigation 
the jury found in favor of heritage on all four claims against scana  awarding a total of million in actual and punitive damages 
it is expected that the court will render a final judgment by the end of november scana has publicly stated that it plans to appeal any adverse judgment by the court 
we cannot predict whether the final judgment will affirm the jury verdict without any modification or whether any appeal of the final judgment by scana will be successful 
as a result  we cannot yet predict whether we will receive any of the damages award covered by this verdict 
all decisions of our general partner relating to the scana litigation are determined by a special litigation committee consisting of one or more independent directors of our general partner 
as soon as practicable after the time that we receive any final cash payment as a result of the resolution of the scana litigation  the special litigation committee will determine the aggregate net amount of these proceeds distributable by us by deducting from the amounts received all costs and expenses incurred by us and our affiliates in connection with the scana litigation and any cash reserves necessary or appropriate to provide for operating expenditures 
when the special litigation committee decides to distribute the distributable proceeds  the amount of the distribution will be deemed to be available cash under our partnership agreement and will be distributed as described below under cash distribution policy 
the amount of distributable proceeds that would be distributed to holders of incentive distribution rights will instead be distributed to the holders of the class c units  pro rata 
we 
table of contents cannot predict whether we will receive any cash payments as a result of the scana litigation and  if so  when these distributions might be received 
the class c units do not have any rights to share in any of our assets or distributions upon dissolution and liquidation of our partnership  except to the extent that any such distributions consist of proceeds from the scana litigation to which the class c unitholders would have otherwise been entitled 
the class c units do not have the privilege of conversion into any other unit and do not have any voting rights except to the extent provided by law  in which case the class c units will be entitled to one vote 
the amount of cash distributions to which the incentive distribution rights are entitled was not increased by the creation of the class c units  rather  the class c units are a mechanism for dividing the incentive distribution rights that heritage holdings and its former stockholders would have been entitled to 
class d units 
the class d units were issued to la grange energy  lp in connection with our acquisition of the etc olpoperations in january and generally had voting rights identical to the voting rights of the common units  and the class d units voted with the common units as a single class on each matter with respect to which the common units were entitled to vote 
each class d unit initially was entitled to receive of the quarterly amount distributed on each common unit  for each quarter  provided that the class d units were subordinated to the common units with respect to the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution for such quarter and any arrearage in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution for all prior quarters 
we were required  as promptly as practicable following the issuance of the class d units  to submit to a vote of our unitholders a change in the terms of the class d units to provide that each class d unit would convert into one common unit immediately upon such approval 
holders of the class d units were entitled to vote upon the proposal to change the terms of the class d units and the special units in the same proportion as the votes cast by the holders of the common units other than the common units issued to la grange energy in connection with the energy transfer transaction with respect to this proposal 
our unitholders approved this change in the terms of the class d units on june  at a special meeting of the common unitholders 
pursuant to the request of the holders of the class d units  these class d units were converted to an equal number of common units on june  class e units 
in conjunction with our purchase of the capital stock of heritage holdings in january  the  common units held by heritage holdings were converted into  class e units 
the class e units generally do not have any voting rights but were entitled to vote on the proposals to make class d units and special units convertible into common units 
these class e units are entitled to aggregate cash distributions equal to of the total amount of cash distributed to all unitholders  including the class e unitholders  up to per unit per year 
we plan to leave the class e units in the form described here indefinitely 
in the event of our termination and liquidation  the class e units will be allocated of any gain upon liquidation and will be allocated any loss upon liquidation to the same extent as the common units 
after the allocation of such amounts  the class e units will be entitled to the balance in their capital accounts  as adjusted for such termination and liquidation 
the terms of the class e units were determined in order to provide us with the opportunity to minimize the impact to us of our ownership of heritage holdings  including the million in deferred tax liabilities of heritage holdings that we inherited in connection with our purchase of heritage holdings 
the class e units are treated as treasury stock for accounting purposes because they are owned by our wholly owned subsidiary  heritage holdings 
due to the ownership of the class e units by this corporate subsidiary  the payment of distributions on the class e units will result in annual tax payments by heritage holdings at corporate federal income tax rates  which tax payments will reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available for distribution to us  as the owners of heritage holdings 
because distributions on the class e units will be available to us as the owner of heritage holdings  those funds will be available  after payment of taxes  for our general partnership purposes  including to satisfy working capital requirements  for the repayment of outstanding debt and to make distributions to our unitholders 
because the class e units are not entitled to receive any allocation of partnership income  gain  loss  deduction or credit that is attributable to our ownership of heritage holdings  such amounts will instead be allocated to our general partner in accordance with its respective interest and the remainder to all unitholders other than the holders of class e units pro rata 
in the event that partnership distributions exceed per unit annually  all such amounts in excess thereof will be available for distribution to unitholders other than the holders of class e units in proportion to their respective interests 
special units 
the special units were issued to la grange energy  lp on january  by us as consideration for the bossier pipeline in connection with the energy transfer transactions 
the special units 
table of contents generally did not have any voting rights but were entitled to vote on the proposal to change the terms of the special units in the same proportion as the votes cast by the holders of the common units other than the common units issued to la grange energy in connection with the energy transfer transactions with respect to this proposal  and were not entitled to share in partnership distributions 
we were required  as promptly as practicable following the issuance of the special units  to submit to a vote of our unitholders the approval of the conversion of the special units into common units in accordance with the terms of the special units 
following unitholder approval at a special meeting of the unitholders on june  and upon the bossier pipeline becoming commercially operational june   each special unit converted into one common unit on june  upon the request of the holder 
incentive distribution rights 
incentive distribution rights represent the contractual right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution has been paid 
please read quarterly distributions of available cash below 
the general partner owns all of the incentive distribution rights  except that in conjunction with the august transaction with us propane  the partnership issued  class c units to heritage holdings  its general partner at that time  in conversion of that portion of heritage holdings incentive distribution rights that entitled it to receive any distribution made by the partnership of funds attributable to the net amount received in connection with the settlement  judgment  award or other final nonappealable resolution of the scana litigation 
the class c units were distributed by heritage holdings to its former shareholders 
any amount payable on the class c units in the future will reduce the amount otherwise distributable to holders of incentive distribution rights at the time the distribution of such litigation proceeds is made and will not reduce the amount distributable to holders of common units 
no payments to date have been made on the class c units

table of contents cash distribution policy general 
we will distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders and our general partner within days following the end of each fiscal quarter 
definition of available cash 
available cash is defined in our partnership agreement and generally means  with respect to any calendar quarter  all cash on hand at the end of such quarter less the amount of cash reserves that are necessary or appropriate in the reasonable discretion of the general partner to provide for the proper conduct of our business comply with applicable law or and debt instrument or other agreement including reserves for future capital expenditures and for our future capital needs  or provide funds for distributions to unitholders and our general partner in respect of any one or more of the next four quarters  plus all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter 
working capital borrowings are generally borrowings that are made under our credit facilities and in all cases are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners 
available cash is more fully defined in the partnership agreement previously filed as an exhibit 
characterization of cash distributions 
we will treat all available cash distributed as coming from operating surplus until the sum of all available cash distributed since we began operations equals the operating surplus as of the most recent date of determination of available cash 
we will treat any amount distributed in excess of operating surplus  regardless of its source  as capital surplus 
as defined in our partnership agreement  operating surplus includes million in addition to our cash balance on the closing date of our initial public offering  cash receipts from our operations and cash from working capital borrowings 
this amount does not reflect actual cash on hand that is available for distribution to our unitholders 
rather  it is a provision that will enable us  if we choose  to distribute as operating surplus up to million of cash we receive in the future from non operating sources  such as asset sales  issuances of securities  and long term borrowings  that would otherwise be distributed as capital surplus 
we have not made  and we anticipate that we will not make  any distributions from capital surplus 
distributions of available cash from operating surplus we will make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for any quarter in the following manner first  to all common and class e unitholders  in accordance with their percentage interests  and to the general partner  until each common unit has received per unit for such quarter the minimum quarterly distribution  second  to all common and class e unitholders  in accordance with their percentage interests  and to the general partner  until each common unit has received per unit for such quarter the first target distribution  third  to all common and class e unitholders  in accordance with their percentage interests  to the holders of incentive distribution rights  pro rata  and to the general partner  until each common unit has received at least per unit for such quarter the second target distribution  fourth  to all common and class e unitholders  in accordance with their percentage interests  to the holders of incentive distribution rights  pro rata  and to the general partner  until each common unit has received at least per unit for such quarter  the third target distribution  and

notwithstanding the foregoing  any arrearage in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution for all prior quarters and the distributions on each class e unit may not exceed per year

however  our subsidiaries  oasis pipe line  heritage holdings and heritage service corporation  are corporations that are subject to income taxes

c ebitda  as adjusted  is defined as the partnership s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  such as compensation charges for unit issuances to employees  gain or loss on disposal of assets  and other expenses 
we present ebitda  as adjusted  on a partnership basis  which includes both the general and limited partner interests 
non cash compensation expense represents charges for the value of the common units awarded under the partnership s compensation plans that have not yet vested under the terms of those plans and are charges which do not  or will not  require cash settlement 
non cash income such as the gain arising from our disposal of assets is not included when determining ebitda  as adjusted 
ebitda  as adjusted  i is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and ii should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flow as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
ebitda  as adjusted  is presented because such information is relevant and is used by management  industry analysts  investors  lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of the partnership s fundamental business activities 
management believes that the presentation of ebitda  as adjusted  is useful to lenders and investors because of its use in the natural gas and propane industries and for master limited partnerships as an indicator of the strength and performance of the partnership s ongoing business operations  including the ability to fund capital expenditures  service debt and pay distributions 
additionally  management believes that ebitda  as adjusted  provides additional and useful information to the partnership s investors for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the operating results of the partnership from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures 
the presentation of ebitda  as adjusted  allows investors to view the partnership s performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management and provides additional insight to the partnership s operating results 

table of contents ebitda  as adjusted  is used by management to determine our operating performance  and along with other data as internal measures for setting annual operating budgets  assessing financial performance of the partnership s numerous business locations  as a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition and as a measurement component of incentive compensation 
the partnership has a large number of business locations located in different regions of the united states 
ebitda  as adjusted  can be a meaningful measure of financial performance because it excludes factors which are outside the control of the employees responsible for operating and managing the business locations  and provides information management can use to evaluate the performance of the business locations  or the region where they are located  and the employees responsible for operating them 
our ebitda  as adjusted  includes non cash compensation expense which is a non cash expense item resulting from our unit based compensation plans that does not require cash settlement and is not considered during management s assessment of the operating results of the partnership s business 
by adding these non cash compensation expenses in ebitda  as adjusted  allows management to compare the partnership s operating results to those of other companies in the same industry who may have compensation plans with levels and values of annual grants that are different than the partnership s 
other expenses include other finance charges and other asset non cash impairment charges that are reflected in the partnership s operating results but are not classified in interest  depreciation and amortization 
we do not include gain on the sale of assets when determining ebitda  as adjusted  since including non cash income resulting from the sale of assets increases the performance measure in a manner that is not related to the true operating results of the partnership s business 
in addition  our debt agreements contain financial covenants based on ebitda  as adjusted 
for a description of these covenants  please read item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of indebtedness 
there are material limitations to using a measure such as ebitda  as adjusted  including the difficulty associated with using it as the sole measure to compare the results of one company to another  and the inability to analyze certain significant items that directly affect a company s net income or loss 
in addition  our calculation of ebitda  as adjusted  may not be consistent with similarly titled measures of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with gaap 
ebitda  as adjusted  for the periods described herein is calculated in the same manner as presented by us in the past 
management compensates for these limitations by considering ebitda  as adjusted  in conjunction with its analysis of other gaap financial measures  such as gross profit  net income loss  and cash flow from operating activities

c ebitda  as adjusted  is defined as heritage s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash items  such as compensation charges for unit issuances to employees  gain or loss on disposal of assets  and other expenses 
heritage presented ebitda  as adjusted  on a partnership basis  which includes both the general and limited partner interests 
non cash compensation expense represents charges for the value of the common units awarded under heritage s compensation plans that have not yet vested under the terms of those plans and are charges which do not  or will not  require cash settlement 
non cash income such as the gain arising from our disposal of assets is not included when determining ebitda  as adjusted 
ebitda  as adjusted  i is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and ii should not be considered in isolation or as a 
table of contents substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flow as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
ebitda  as adjusted  is presented because such information is relevant and is used by management  industry analysts  investors  lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of heritage s fundamental business activities 
management believes that the presentation of ebitda  as adjusted  is useful to lenders and investors because of its use in the propane industry and for master limited partnerships as an indicator of the strength and performance of heritage s ongoing business operations  including the ability to fund capital expenditures  service debt and pay distributions 
additionally  management believes that ebitda  as adjusted  provides additional and useful information to heritage s investors for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the operating results of heritage from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures 
the presentation of ebitda  as adjusted  allows investors to view heritage s performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management and provides additional insight to heritage s operating results 
ebitda  as adjusted  is used by management to determine our operating performance  and along with other data as internal measures for setting annual operating budgets  assessing financial performance of heritage s numerous business locations  as a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition and as a measurement component of incentive compensation 
the heritage had a large number of business locations located in different regions of the united states 
ebitda  as adjusted  can be a meaningful measure of financial performance because it excludes factors which are outside the control of the employees responsible for operating and managing the business locations  and provides information management can use to evaluate the performance of the business locations  or the region where they are located  and the employees responsible for operating them 
to present ebitda  as adjusted on a full partnership basis  we add back the minority interest of the general partner because net income is reported net of the general partner s minority interest 
heritage s ebitda  as adjusted  includes non cash compensation expense which is a non cash expense item resulting from our unit based compensation plans that does not require cash settlement and is not considered during management s assessment of the operating results of heritage s business 
by adding these non cash compensation expenses in ebitda  as adjusted  allows management to compare the partnership s operating results to those of other companies in the same industry who may have compensation plans with levels and values of annual grants that are different than heritage s 
other expenses include other finance charges and other asset non cash impairment charges that are reflected in heritage s operating results but are not classified in interest  depreciation and amortization 
we do not include gain on the sale of assets when determining ebitda  as adjusted  since including non cash income resulting from the sale of assets increases the performance measure in a manner that is not related to the true operating results of the partnership s business 
in addition  heritage s debt agreements contain financial covenants based on ebitda  as adjusted 
for a description of these covenants  please read item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations description of indebtedness 
there are material limitations to using a measure such as ebitda  as adjusted  including the difficulty associated with using it as the sole measure to compare the results of one company to another  and the inability to analyze certain significant items that directly affect a company s net income or loss 
in addition  heritage s calculation of ebitda  as adjusted  may not be consistent with similarly titled measures of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with gaap 
ebitda  as adjusted  for the periods described herein is calculated in the same manner as presented by heritage in the past 
management compensates for these limitations by considering ebitda  as adjusted  in conjunction with its analysis of other gaap financial measures  such as gross profit  net income  and cash flow from operating activities

other recent transactions 
table of contents on june   we announced the closing of the acquisition of the midstream natural gas assets of txu fuel company  a gas transportation subsidiary of txu corp  which we refer to as the tufco acquisition  for approximately million in cash  subject to post closing adjustments 
the former tufco system  which we refer to as the et fuel system  serves some of the most active drilling areas in the united states 
the et fuel system is comprised of approximately  miles of intrastate natural gas pipeline and related natural gas storage facilities located in texas 
the et fuel system is strategically located near high growth production areas and major markets such as the waha hub  the katy hub and the carthage hub  three major natural gas trading centers located in texas 
on november  we announced the closing of the acquisition of certain midstream natural gas assets of devon energy corporation devon for approximately million in cash after adjustments 
the assets  known as the texas chalk and madison systems  include approximately  miles of gathering and mainline pipeline systems  four natural gas treating plants  condensate stabilization facilities  fractionation facilities and the mmcf d madison gas processing plant 
general the energy transfer transactions were accounted for as a reverse acquisition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
although heritage was the surviving parent entity for legal purposes  etc olp was the acquiror for accounting purposes 
as a result  etc olp s historical financial statements will be the historical financial statements of the registrant 
the operations of heritage prior to the energy transfer transactions are referred to as heritage 
midstream and transportation segments our midstream and transportation segments are operated by etc olp 
these segments commenced operations in october with etc olp s acquisition of the natural gas gathering  processing and transportation assets previously owned by aquila  inc the assets acquired from aquila include the southeast texas system and the oklahoma system as well as a equity interest in the oasis pipe line company oasis 
etc olp purchased the remaining interest in oasis pipeline on december  the equity method of accounting was used to account for our oasis pipeline from october  through december  at which time it became a fully consolidated subsidiary 
we own and operate approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transportation pipelines with an aggregate throughput capacity of billion cubic feet of natural gas per day  with natural gas treating and processing plants located in texas  oklahoma  and louisiana 
our major asset groups consist of the southeast texas system  the elk city system  the oasis pipeline  the et fuel system  and the bossier pipeline 
the southeast texas system has a throughput capacity of  mmcf d and includes approximately  miles of pipeline with approximately  wells connected  the la grange and madison processing plants  and ten natural gas treating facilities 
the elk city system has a throughput capacity of mmcf d and includes approximately miles of pipeline with wells connected  the elk city processing plant  and a treating facility 
the mile long oasis pipeline  which connects the west texas waha hub to the katy texas tailgate  has a throughput capacity of bcf d 
the et fuel system  which serves some of the most active drilling areas in the united states  is comprised of approximately  miles of intrastate natural gas pipeline 
the et fuel system is strategically located near high growth production areas and major centers such as the waha hub  the katy hub  and the carthage hub and has a throughput capacity of bcf d 
the bossier pipeline is a mile natural gas pipeline that connects three treating facilities with our southeast texas assets of which  one treating facility is owned by us 
this bossier pipeline is the first phase of a multi phased project that will service producers in east and north central texas 
the bossier pipeline has throughput capacity of mmcf d and currently has over mmcf d of pipeline capacity contracted under long term agreements with xto energy inc and other producers 
results from the midstream segment are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered  compressed  treated  processed  purchased and sold through our pipeline and gathering systems and the level of natural gas and ngl prices 
we generate our midstream revenues and gross margins principally under fee based arrangements or other arrangements 
under fee based arrangements  we receive a fee for natural gas gathering  compressing  treating or processing services 
the revenue we earn from these arrangements is directly related to the volume of natural gas that flows through its systems and is not directly dependent on commodity prices 

table of contents we also utilize other types of arrangements in the midstream segment  including i discount to index price arrangements which involve purchases of natural gas at either a percentage discount to a specified index price  a specified index price less a fixed amount or a percentage discount to a specified index price less an additional fixed amount  ii percentage of proceeds arrangements under which we gather and process natural gas on behalf of producers  selling the resulting residue gas and ngl volumes at market prices and remitting to producers an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on an index price  and iii keep whole arrangements where we gather natural gas from the producer  process the natural gas and sell the resulting ngls to third parties at market prices 
in many cases  we provide services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described above 
the terms of our contracts vary based upon gas quality conditions  the competitive environment at the time the contracts are signed and customer requirements 
the contract mix may change as a result of changes in producer preferences  expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors 
our ownership of the oasis pipeline allows us to elect not to process natural gas at the la grange processing plant when processing margins are unfavorable 
we can bypass the la grange processing plant and deliver natural gas meeting pipeline quality specifications by blending rich natural gas from the southeast texas system with lean natural gas transported on the oasis pipeline 
we can also generally bypass the elk city processing plant 
the natural gas supplied to the elk city system has a relatively low ngl content and does not require processing to meet pipeline quality specifications 
during periods of unfavorable processing margins  we can bypass the elk city processing plant and deliver the natural gas directly into connecting pipelines 
we conduct our marketing operations through our producer services business  in which we market the natural gas that flows through our assets  which we refer to as on system gas  and attracts other customers by marketing volumes of natural gas that do not move through our assets  which we refer to as off system gas 
for both on system and off system gas  we purchase natural gas from natural gas producers and other supply points and sell that natural gas to utilities  industrial consumers  other marketers and pipeline companies  thereby generating gross margins based upon the difference between the purchase and resale prices 
our marketing activities involve the marketing of on system and off system gas 
for the fiscal year ended august   we marketed approximately mmcf d of natural gas  of which was on system gas 
substantially all of our on system marketing efforts involve natural gas that flows through either the southeast texas system or the oasis pipeline 
we market only a small amount of natural gas that flows through the elk city system 
for off system gas  we purchase gas or act as an agent for small independent producers that do not have marketing operations 
we develop relationships with natural gas producers  which facilitates our purchase of their production on a long term basis 
we believe that this business provides us with strategic insights and valuable market intelligence  which may impact our expansion and acquisition strategy 
results from our transportation segment are determined primarily by the amount of capacity our customers reserve as well as the actual volume of natural gas that flows through our transportation pipelines 
under transportation contracts  we charge our customers i a demand fee  which is a fixed fee for the reservation of an agreed amount of capacity on the transportation pipeline for a specified period of time and which obligates the customer to pay us even if the customer does not transport natural gas on the respective pipeline  ii a transportation fee  which is based on the actual throughput of natural gas by the customer on the oasis pipeline  iii a fuel retention based on a percentage of gas transported on the pipeline  or a combination of the three  generally payable monthly 
retail and wholesale propane segments our propane related segments are operated by holp and its subsidiaries who are engaged in the sale  distribution and marketing of propane and other related products through its retail  domestic wholesale and foreign wholesale propane segments  the propane segments and also through the liquids marketing activity of heritage energy resources 
holp derives its revenue primarily from the retail propane segment 
we believe that heritage was  and we are now  the fourth largest retail marketer of propane in the united states  based on retail gallons sold 
we serve more than  propane customers in from customer service locations in states 

table of contents the propane segments are margin based businesses in which gross profits depend on the excess of sales price over propane supply cost 
the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which we will have no control 
product supply contracts are one year agreements subject to annual renewal and generally permit suppliers to charge posted prices plus transportation costs at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major delivery points 
since rapid increases in the wholesale cost of propane may not be immediately passed on to retail customers  such increases could reduce gross profits 
we generally have attempted to reduce price risk by purchasing propane on a short term basis 
we have on occasion purchased significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at our customer service locations and in major storage facilities for future resale 
our retail propane business of the partnership consists principally of transporting propane purchased in the contract and spot markets  primarily from major fuel suppliers  to our customer service locations and then to propane tanks located on the customers premises  as well as to portable propane cylinders 
in the residential and commercial markets  propane is primarily used for space heating  water heating  and cooking 
in the agricultural market  propane is primarily used for crop drying  tobacco curing  poultry brooding  and weed control 
in addition  propane is used for certain industrial applications  including use as an engine fuel to power vehicles and forklifts and as a heating source in manufacturing and mining processes 
since its formation in  heritage grew primarily through acquisitions of retail propane operations and  to a lesser extent  through internal growth 
since its inception through january   heritage completed acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price approximating million 
since the energy transfer transactions on january  through august   we have completed three additional retail propane acquisitions 
our propane distribution business is largely seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in our service areas 
propane sales to residential and commercial customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
historically  approximately two thirds of heritage s retail propane volume and in excess of of heritage s ebitda  as adjusted  is attributable to sales during the six month peak heating season of october through march 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income in the propane segments during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september of each year 
consequently  sales and operating profits for the propane segments are concentrated in the first and second fiscal quarters  however  cash flow from operations is generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane purchased during the six month peak heating season 
sales to industrial and agricultural customers are much less weather sensitive 
a substantial portion of our propane is used in the heating sensitive residential and commercial markets causing the temperatures realized in our areas of operations  particularly during the six month peak heating season  to have a significant effect on the financial performance in our propane operations 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane use  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater propane use 
we use information on normal temperatures in understanding how temperatures that are colder or warmer than normal affect historical results of operations and in preparing forecasts related to our future operations 
the retail propane segment s gross profit margins are not only affected by weather patterns  but also vary according to customer mix 
sales to residential customers generate higher margins than sales to certain other customer groups  such as commercial or agricultural customers 
wholesale propane segment s margins are substantially lower than retail margins 
in addition  propane gross profit margins vary by geographical region 
accordingly  a change in customer or geographic mix can affect propane gross profit without necessarily affecting total revenues 
amounts discussed below reflect of the results of mp energy partnership the foreign wholesale propane segment 
mp energy partnership is a canadian general partnership in which holp owns a interest 
because mp energy partnership is primarily engaged in lower margin wholesale distribution  its contribution to our net income is not significant and the minority interest of this partnership is excluded from the ebitda  as adjusted  calculation 
analysis of historical results of operations 
table of contents the energy transfer transactions affect the comparability of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended august  to the eleven months ended august  because our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended august  include the twelve month results for etc olp and its subsidiaries and the results of holp  its subsidiaries  and heritage holdings only for the period from january  through august  the financial statements of etc olp for the eleven months ended august  reflect only the results of etc olp and its subsidiaries  and the financial statements of heritage reflect the results of holp and its subsidiaries see note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements 
the changes in the line items discussed below are a result of these transactions 
the aggregate results disclosed below reflect heritage s historical results from september  until the closing of the energy transfer transactions on january   and of heritage s historical results for the fiscal year ended august   and the actual results for the year ended august   for comparability purposes only 
this aggregate information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the transactions been made at the beginning of the periods presented or the future results of the combined operations 
fiscal year ended august  compared to the eleven months ended august volume 
total volumes of natural gas sales  ngl sales including propane  and natural gas transported by our midstream  transportation  retail propane  domestic wholesale propane  and foreign wholesale propane segments for the fiscal year ended august  and eleven months ended august  are as follows eleven months year ended year ended ended year ended august  august  august  august  actual aggregate etc olp aggregate unaudited actual unaudited midstream natural gas mmbtu d ngls bbls d transportation natural gas mmbtu d propane gallons in thousands retail domestic wholesale foreign wholesale total gallons natural gas sales volumes were  mmbtu d for the year ended august  compared to  mmbtu d for the eleven months ended august   an increase of  mmbtu d or 
ngls sales volumes decreased from  bbls d for the eleven months ended august  to  bbls d for the year ended august  the increased natural gas sales volumes are result of our expanded marketing efforts  enhanced relationships with producers and expanded credit facilities with commodity counter parties 
as previously discussed  our sales volumes of ngls varies due to our ability to by pass our processing plants during unfavorable conditions to process and extract ngls from our processing plants 
the decrease in ngls sales volumes was attributable to the bypassing of our la grange plant 
total retail propane gallons sold in the twelve months ended august  were million gallons  with no retail propane gallons reflected in the year ended august  the difference in retail gallons sold is due to the energy transfer transactions described above 
we also sold approximately million and million domestic and foreign wholesale propane gallons  respectively  in the fiscal year ended august   with no domestic or foreign wholesale propane gallons reflected for the eleven months ended august  as a comparison  heritage would have reflected aggregate volumes of million retail propane gallons for the fiscal year ended august  and historical volumes of million gallons for the fiscal year ended august  of the million gallon aggregate increase  million gallons are the result of volumes sold by customer service locations added through acquisitions  offset by a decrease of million gallons that were weather related 

table of contents we experienced temperatures that were on average  warmer in the twelve months ended august  compared to last year and warmer than normal during fiscal also  as a comparison  heritage would have reflected aggregated volumes of million and million domestic wholesale and foreign wholesale propane gallons  respectively  for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to historical volumes of million and million domestic and foreign wholesale propane gallons for the fiscal year ended august  the million gallon decrease in domestic wholesale propane gallons is primarily the effect of the loss of two commercial customers to alternative fuel sources  and the million gallon decrease in foreign wholesale volumes is due to an exchange contract that was in effect during the fiscal year ended august   which was not economical to renew during fiscal set forth in the table below is certain financial data for the periods presented

total revenues were  million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  million for the eleven months ended august  these revenues reflect a full twelve months of etc olp s revenues consolidated with the revenues of holp after the energy transfer transactions occurred from january  through august  
the aggregate revenues for the periods presented would have been total revenues of  million for the year ended august  as compared to aggregate total revenues of  million for the year ended august  total midstream and transportation revenues were  million for the year ended august  compared to  million for the eleven months ended august   an increase of  million or 
midstream revenues increased  million or from million for the eleven months ended august  to  million for the year ended august  the increase is principally attributable to expanding our producer services activities and increases in sales volumes during the year ended august  our average natural gas sales prices were per mmbtu for the year ended august  compared to per mmbtu for the eleven months ended august  average ngls sales prices increased or from per gallon for the eleven months ended august  compared to per gallon for the year ended august  the market price for ngls tends to correlate with the price of crude oil 
transportation revenues were million for the year ended august  compared to million for the eleven months ended august   an increase of 
the significant increase in transportation revenues is principally due to the following accounting for oasis pipeline 
as discussed above  we accounted for the oasis pipeline as an equity method investment prior to december  when we purchased the remaining in oasis pipeline 
as a result  the eleven months ended august  only includes the results of operations subsequent to december  had oasis pipeline been consolidated for the entire reporting period  transportation revenues would have been million for the eleven months ended august  increased volumes 
during the year ended august   we transported  mmbtu d through our transportation pipelines compared to  mmbtu d during the period from december  to august   an increase of  mmbtu d or 
the volume increase is a result of our decision to pursue additional volumes on the middle and west end of the system on the oasis pipeline  the acquisition of the et fuel system in june  and the completion of the bossier pipeline in june the et fuel system and bossier pipeline contributed million in revenues from the date of acquisition or completion through august  we believe that we will be able to increase throughput on  and therefore revenue from  the et fuel system in future years through the addition of interconnects with other pipelines and other industrial end users  the addition of new customers and more active management of the et fuel system and storage facilities to capitalize market opportunities 
in addition  a wide basis differential between the waha and katy market hubs provides an incentive to transport increased volumes of natural gas to a more attractive marketplace 

table of contents for the fiscal year ended august   we had retail propane revenues of million  domestic wholesale propane revenues of million  foreign wholesale propane revenues of million  other revenues of million and net liquids marketing activities of million with no propane revenues reflected in the eleven months ended august  these revenues reflect only the amounts earned after the energy transfer transactions from january  through august  
as a comparison  for the fiscal ended august   heritage would have reflected aggregate retail propane revenues of million as compared to historical revenues of million in the fiscal year ended august  for heritage

the increase is principally attributable to the increase in sales volumes and prices during the year ended august  as we have expanded our marketing efforts 
transportation cost of sales was million for the year ended august  and million for the eleven months ended august  the transportation segment generally retains a portion of each shipper s gas to compensate for fuel used in operating the pipeline 
the actual usage of gas can differ from the amounts retained from our customers 
cost of sales activity is typically generated from the sale of excess inventory or the recognition  either positive or negative  of unaccounted fuel within the pipeline system

ebitda  as adjusted 
ebitda  as adjusted  increased million to million for the fiscal year ended august  as compared to ebitda  as adjusted  of million for the eleven months ended august  this increase is due to the energy transfer transactions and operating performance described above 
this ebitda  as adjusted  reflects the full twelve months of etc olp s ebitda  as adjusted  consolidated with the ebitda  as adjusted  of holp after the energy transfer transactions from january  through august

we present ebitda  as adjusted  on a partnership basis  which includes both the general and limited partner interests 
non cash compensation expense represents charges for the value of the common units awarded under the partnership s compensation plans that have not yet vested under the terms of those plans and are charges which do not  or will not  require cash settlement 
non cash income or loss such as the gain or loss arising from our disposal of assets is not included when determining ebitda  as adjusted 
ebitda  as adjusted  i is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and ii should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income  income from operations or cash flow as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
ebitda  as adjusted  is presented because such information is relevant and is used by management  industry analysts  investors  lenders and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of our fundamental business activities 
management believes that the presentation of ebitda  as adjusted  is useful to lenders and investors because of its use in the natural gas and propane industries and for master limited partnerships as an indicator of the strength and performance of the partnership s ongoing business operations  including the ability to fund capital expenditures  service debt and pay distributions 
additionally  management believes that ebitda  as adjusted  provides additional and useful information to our investors for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the operating results of our partnership from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures 
the presentation of ebitda  as adjusted  allows investors to view our performance in a manner similar to the methods used by management and provides additional insight to our operating results 
ebitda  as adjusted  is used by management to determine our operating performance  and along with other data as internal measures for setting annual operating budgets  assessing financial performance of our numerous business locations  as a measure for evaluating targeted businesses for acquisition and as a measurement component of incentive compensation 
we have a large number of business locations located 
table of contents in different regions of the united states 
ebitda  as adjusted  can be a meaningful measure of financial performance because it excludes factors which are outside the control of the employees responsible for operating and managing the business locations  and provides information management can use to evaluate the performance of the business locations  or the region where they are located  and the employees responsible for operating them 
to present ebitda  as adjusted  on a full partnership basis  we add back the minority interest of the general partner because net income is reported net of the general partner s minority interest 
our ebitda  as adjusted  includes non cash compensation expense which is a non cash expense item resulting from our unit based compensation plans that does not require cash settlement and is not considered during management s assessment of the operating results of the our business 
by adding these non cash compensation expenses in ebitda  as adjusted  allows management to compare our operating results to those of other companies in the same industry who may have compensation plans with levels and values of annual grants that are different than ours 
other expenses include other finance charges and other asset non cash impairment charges that are reflected in our operating results but are not classified in interest  depreciation and amortization 
we do not include gain or loss on the sale of assets when determining ebitda  as adjusted  since including non cash income or loss resulting from the sale of assets increases decreases the performance measure in a manner that is not related to the true operating results of our business

there are material limitations to using a measure such as ebitda  as adjusted  including the difficulty associated with using it as the sole measure to compare the results of one company to another  and the inability to analyze certain significant items that directly affect a company s net income or loss 
in addition  our calculation of ebitda  as adjusted  may not be consistent with similarly titled measures of other companies and should be viewed in conjunction with measurements that are computed in accordance with gaap 
ebitda  as adjusted  for the periods described herein is calculated in the same manner as presented by us and heritage in the past 
management compensates for these limitations by considering ebitda  as adjusted in conjunction with its analysis of other gaap financial measures  such as gross profit  net income loss  and cash flow from operating activities

the note agreements for each of the senior secured notes  medium term note program and senior secured promissory notes  and the operating partnership s bank credit facilities contain customary restrictive covenants applicable to the operating partnerships  changes in ownership of the operating partnerships  including limitations on the level of additional indebtedness  creation of liens  and substantial disposition of assets 
these covenants require the operating partnerships to maintain ratios of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitda as these terms are similarly defined in the bank credit facilities and the note agreements of not more than to for holp s bank credit facility and note agreements and to during the day period following the funding of the purchase price of the et fuel system and to to during any period other than the day period following the funding of the purchase price of the et fuel system for etc olp s bank credit facility and consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as these terms are similarly defined in the bank credit facilities and the note agreements of not less than to for holp s bank credit facility and note agreements and to for etc olp s bank credit facility 
the consolidated ebitda used to determine these ratios is calculated in accordance with these debt agreements 
for purposes of calculating the ratios under the bank credit facilities and the note agreements  consolidated ebitda is based upon the operating partnership s ebitda  as adjusted  during the most recent four quarterly periods and modified to give pro forma effect for acquisitions and divestures made during the test period  and is compared to consolidated funded indebtedness as of the test date and the consolidated interest expense for the most recent twelve months 
the debt agreements also provide that the operating partnerships may declare  make  or incur a liability to make  a restricted payment during each fiscal quarter  if a the amount of such restricted payment  together with all other restricted payments during such quarter  do not exceed available cash with respect to the immediately preceding quarter  b no default or event of default exists before such restricted payment  and c each operating partnership s restricted payment is not greater than the product of each operating partnership s percentage of aggregate partner obligations as these terms are similarly defined in the bank credit facilities and the note agreements 
the debt agreements further provide that holp s available cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to of the interest to be paid on the notes 
in addition  in the third  second and first quarters preceding a quarter in which a scheduled principal payment is to be made on the notes  available cash is required to reflect a reserve equal to   and  respectively  of the principal amount to be repaid on such payment dates 
failure to comply with the various restrictive and affirmative covenants of the operating partnership s bank credit facilities and the note agreements could negatively impact our ability to incur additional debt and our ability to pay distributions

new accounting standards in january of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb issued fin r  which clarified certain issues identified in fin fin r requires an entity to consolidate a variable interest entity to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the entity does not have a majority of voting interest 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of this statement apply at inception of any entity created after january  for an entity created before february   the provisions of this interpretation must be applied at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after march  the adoption did not have an impact on the partnerships consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as of august   we own various unconsolidated entities in which our share of the unconsolidated entities range from to 
we account for our investments under the equity method of accounting as prescribed by apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
we do not control these entities and each partner shares in all profits and losses equal to their respective share in the entities 
there are no limits on the exposure to losses or on the ability to share in returns 
based on the analysis performed  we are not the primary beneficiary of the entities  and as a result  we will not consolidate the entities but will continue to account for our investment in these entities under the equity method 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of sfas as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted the provisions of sfas as of september  the adoption did not have a material impact on the partnership s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities 
table of contents have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment applied to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
for further details on our accounting policies and a discussion of new accounting pronouncements  see note summary of significant accounting policies and balance sheet detail to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for sales or services at the time the natural gas or ngls are delivered or at the time the service is performed 
transportation capacity payments are recognized when earned in the period the capacity is made available 
sales of propane  propane appliances  parts  and fitting are recognized at the later of the time of delivery of the product to the customer or the time of sale or installation 
revenue from service labor is recognized upon completion of the service and tank rent is recognized ratably over the period it is earned 
shipping and handling revenues are included in the price of propane charged to customers  and thus are classified as revenues 
marketable securities 
we have marketable securities that are classified as available for sale 
unrealized holding losses occur as a result of declines in the market value of our holdings 
the fair market value of these holdings is determined based upon the market price of the securities  which are publicly traded securities 
based on the performance of the securities over the preceding nine month period  we reviewed the fair market value to determine if an other than temporary impairment should be recorded 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
long lived assets are required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill must be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss should be recognized only if the carrying amount of the asset goodwill is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in order to test for recoverability  we must make estimates of projected cash flows related to the asset which include  but are not limited to  assumptions about the use or disposition of the asset  estimated remaining life of the asset  and future expenditures necessary to maintain the asset s existing service potential 
in order to determine fair value  we make certain estimates and assumptions  including  among other things  changes in general economic conditions in regions in which our markets are located  the availability and prices of natural gas and propane supply  our ability to negotiate favorable sales agreements  the risks that natural gas exploration and production activities will not occur or be successful  our dependence on certain significant customers and producers of natural gas  and competition from other midstream companies  including major energy producers 
due to the subjectivity of the assumptions used to test for recoverability and to determine fair value  significant impairment charges could result in the future  thus affecting our future reported net income 
stock based compensation plans 
we account for our stock compensation plans following the fair value recognition method 
this method was adopted as we believe it is the preferable method of accounting for stock based compensation 
please see the caption stock based compensation plans in note summary of significant accounting policies and balance sheet detail to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report for additional information about this adoption 
property  plant  and equipment 
maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their useful lives 
maintenance capital expenditures also include capital expenditures made to connect additional wells to our systems in order to maintain or increase throughput on its existing assets 
growth or expansion capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to expand the existing operating capacity of our assets  whether through construction or acquisition 
we treat repair and maintenance expenditures that do not extend the useful life of existing assets as operating expenses as we incur them 
upon disposition or retirement of pipeline components or gas plant components  any gain or loss is recorded to accumulated depreciation 
when entire pipeline systems  gas plants or other property and equipment are retired or sold  any gain or loss is included in operations 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is provided using the straight line method based on their estimated useful life ranging from to years 
changes in the estimated useful lives of the assets could have a material effect 
table of contents on our results of operation 
we do not anticipate future changes in the estimated useful live of our property  plant  and equipment 
amortization of intangible assets 
we calculate amortization using the straight line method over periods ranging from to years 
we use amortization methods and determine asset values based on management s best estimate using reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
changes in the amortization methods or asset values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we do not anticipate future changes in the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets 
fair value of derivative commodity contracts 
we utilize various exchange traded and over the counter commodity financial instrument contracts to limit our exposure to margin fluctuations in natural gas  ngl and propane prices 
these contracts consist primarily of commodity forward  future  swaps  options and certain basis contracts as cash flow hedging instruments 
many of these contracts  which  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are not accounted for as hedges  but are marked to fair value on the income statement 
in our retail propane business  we classify all gains and losses from these derivative contracts entered into for risk management purposes as liquids marketing revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
on our contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 the effective portion of the hedged gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the instrument settles 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
we utilize published settlement prices for exchange traded contracts  quotes provided by brokers  and estimates of market prices based on daily contract activity to estimate the fair value of these contracts 
the values have been adjusted to reflect the potential impact of liquidating a position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under existing market conditions 
changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we do not anticipate future changes in the methods used to determine the fair value of these derivative contracts 
natural gas imbalances 
we record imbalance receivables and payables when a customer delivers more or less gas into our pipelines than they take out 
we primarily estimate the value of our imbalances at prices representing the value of the commodity at the end of the accounting reporting period 
changes in natural gas prices may impact our valuation 
based on our net receivable position of million as of august   a change in natural gas prices of percent could positively or negatively affect our results of operations by million 
volume measurement 
we record amounts for natural gas gathering and transportation revenue  liquid transportation and handling revenue  natural gas sales and natural gas purchases  and the sale of production based on volumetric calculations 
variances resulting from such calculations are inherent in our business 
asset retirement obligation 
an entity is required to recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
if a reasonable estimate cannot be made in the period the asset retirement obligation is incurred  the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
in order to determine fair value  management must make certain estimates and assumptions including  among other things  projected cash flows  a credit adjusted risk free rate  and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
these estimates and assumptions are very subjective 
we have determined that we are obligated by contractual or regulatory requirements to remove assets or perform other remediation upon retirement of certain assets 
however  the fair value of the asset retirement obligation cannot currently be reasonably estimated because the settlement dates are indeterminate 
we will record an asset retirement obligation in the periods in which it can reasonably determine the settlement dates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we face market risk from commodity variations  risks related to interest rate variations  and to a lesser extent  credit risks 
from time to time  we may utilize derivative financial instruments as described below to manage our exposure to such risks 

table of contents commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk from the risk of price changes in the natural gas and ngls that we buy and sell and in our midstream  processing and marketing activities 
derivative instruments are used to protect margins on natural gas purchases  sales  transportation  and natural gas liquid sales 
pursuant to our risk management policy  we do not engage in speculative trading in our midstream  processing and marketing activities 
in our retail propane business  the market price of propane is often subject to volatile changes as a result of supply or other market conditions over which we have no control 
in the past  price changes have generally been passed along to our propane customers to maintain gross margins  mitigating the commodity price risk 
in order to help ensure adequate supply sources are available to us during periods of high demand  we will at times purchase significant volumes of propane during periods of low demand  which generally occur during the summer months  at the then current market price  for storage both at our customer service locations and in major storage facilities and for future resale 
we use a combination of financial instruments including  but not limited to  futures  price swaps and basis trades to manage our exposure to market fluctuations in the prices of natural gas  ngls and propane 
swaps and futures allow us to protect our margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of financial instruments are generally offset by gains or losses in the physical market 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances when sales volumes are less than expected requiring market purchases to meet commitments  or our counterparties fail to purchase the contracted quantities of natural gas or otherwise fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly protected against decreases in such prices 
we manage our price risk related to future physical purchase or sale commitments for our producer services activities by entering into either corresponding physical delivery contracts or financial instruments with an objective to balance our future commitments and significantly reduce our risk to the movement in prices 
however  we are subject to counterparty risk for both the physical and financial contracts 
we account for such physical contracts under the normal purchases and sales exception in accordance with sfas no 
in our midstream and transportation segments  we account for certain of our derivatives as cash flow hedges under sfas this accounting allows for the effective portion of gains and losses on derivatives of cash flow hedges to be reported as other comprehensive income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge will be reported in net income as it occurs 
when the derivative is settled  along with the hedged transaction  the amount in other comprehensive income that is related to the derivative will be reported in net income 
for each reporting period  we record the fair value of financial instruments based on the difference between the quoted market price and the contract price 
accordingly  the change in fair value is recorded as a liability or asset 
in addition  realized gains or losses from settled contracts are recorded in gain or loss from derivates 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the related anticipated future cash flow is recognized in earnings

 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf  applied to energy trading contracts not within the scope of sfas that were entered into prior to october  the types of contracts we utilize in our liquids marketing segment include energy commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps traded on the over the counter financial markets 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  derivative financial instruments utilized in connection with our liquids marketing activity are accounted for using the mark to market method 
additionally  all energy trading contracts entered into prior to october  were accounted for using the mark to market method in accordance with the provisions of eitf by heritage 
under the mark to market method of accounting  forwards  swaps  options  and storage contracts are reflected at fair value  and are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities from liquids marketing activities 
as of august   heritage adopted the applicable provisions of eitf issue no 
 issues related to accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf  which requires that gains and losses on derivative instruments be shown net in the statement of operations if the derivative instruments are held for trading purposes 
net realized and unrealized gains and losses from the financial contracts and the impact of price movements are recognized in the statement of operations as liquids marketing revenue 
changes in the assets and liabilities from the liquids marketing activities result primarily from changes in the market prices  newly originated transactions  and the timing and settlement of contracts 
eitf also rescinds eitf for all energy trading contracts entered into after october  and specifies certain disclosure requirements 
consequently  we do not and heritage did not apply mark to market accounting for any contracts entered into after october  that are not within the scope of sfas we attempt to balance its contractual portfolio in terms of notional amounts and timing of performance and delivery obligations 
however  net unbalanced positions can exist 
the notional amounts and terms of these financial instruments as of august  include fixed price payor for  barrels of propane and fixed price receiver of  barrels of propane 
notional amounts reflect the volume of the transactions  but do not represent the amounts exchanged by the parties to the financial instruments 
accordingly  notional amounts do not accurately measure heritage s exposure to market or credit risks 
the fair value of the financial instruments related to liquids marketing activities  as of august  were assets of million and liabilities of million 
on all transactions where we are exposed to counterparty risk  we analyze the counterparty s financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establish limits  and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis 

table of contents sensitivity analysis at august   the fair value of nymex futures was million on a net short position of  mmbtu 
a hypothetical change of in the underlying commodity value would change the fair value of the futures by million 
at august  the fair value of basis trades was million on a net short of position of  mmbtu 
a hypothetical change of in basis prices would change the fair value by million 
we also hedged liquid sales in our midstream segment during the quarter ended august  the fair value of these hedges at august  was million on a short position of  bbls 
a hypothetical price change of on the liquid hedges would have an effect of million on the fair value of derivatives 
estimates related to our liquids marketing activities are sensitive to uncertainty and volatility inherent in the energy commodities markets and actual results could differ from these estimates 
a theoretical change of in the underlying commodity value of the liquids marketing contracts would not change the market value of the contracts as there was no unbalanced positions at august  the following table summarizes the fair value of our liquids marketing contracts  aggregated by method of estimating fair value of the contracts as of august  where settlement had not yet occurred 
these contracts all have a maturity of less than year 
the market prices used to value these transactions reflect management s best estimate considering various factors including closing average spot prices for the current and outer months plus a differential to consider time value and storage costs

table of contents heritage august  august  august  less realized gains losses recognized during the period unrealized gains losses in fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our long term debt with floating interest rates 
an interest rate swap agreement is used to manage a portion of the exposure related to etc olp s term loan facility to changing interest rates by converting floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
as of august   this interest rate swap had a notional amount of million that matures on october  the fair value of the interest rate swap is marked to market and the changes in the fair value are recorded in interest expense 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of million as of august  we also have long term debt instruments  which are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt obligations mature  we may refinance all or a portion of such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
as of august   we had million of variable rate debt of which million is covered by the interest rate swap discussed above 
a change of one percent in the libor rates effective as of august  would have changed interest expense by million 
this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate borrowings outstanding as of august  credit risk we are diligent in attempting to ensure that we issue credit to only credit worthy customers 
however  our purchase and resale of gas exposes us to significant credit risk  as the margin on any sale is generally a small percentage of the total sales price 
therefore  a credit loss can be very large relative to our overall profitability
