item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following is management s assessment of certain significant factors affecting the financial condition and operating results of energy group and its subsidiaries over the past three years 
the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional data 
for the twelve months ended december   of energy group s operating revenues were derived from central hudson s electric service  from central hudson s natural gas service  and from the competitive business subsidiaries 
executive summary the past five years have been turbulent times for the electric and natural gas utility industries 
although there was some recovery in  numerous utilities experienced declining credit quality  and many utility investors experienced large losses in the market value of their securities 
even today  there is uncertainty regarding the direction of deregulation and how regulators will respond to customer expectations for regulated utilities to deliver higher levels of reliability and customer service 
from the very beginning of deregulation in  energy group has remained focused on considering all options for sustaining and increasing shareholder value in today s fiercely competitive capital markets 
in all of its endeavors  energy group is committed to maintaining strong credit quality by carefully assessing and managing risk 
although each succeeding year has been filled with surprises  energy group has stayed on a steady course and provided its shareholders with an attractive  total return  consisting of stock price appreciation and dividends paid 
in fact o energy group s total return during the last three years  a period of market instability  placed it in the top of the edison electric institute s index of electric utilities 
o central hudson s delivery prices for all classes of customers are the lowest in new york state  and household prices are at least below the statewide average 
o electric service reliability has steadily improved  as has the number of highly satisfied customers 
o energy group s credit rating is among the highest in the industry 
a strategic assessment energy group and its stock have outperformed the industry by staying away from risky ventures and  when required to do so  responding incisively and decisively to changing markets 
as a result  cash of million and borrowing capacity of at least another million is available to deploy in businesses that will increase shareholder value over time 
as reported at the annual shareholders meeting in april  major planning initiatives are being undertaken on three fronts to grow earnings  to increase cash flow  and to maintain the dividend at the current level in the foreseeable future 
o first  management is seeking to utilize available cash reserves and debt capacity to selectively acquire electric generating and or natural gas pipeline assets and passive investments that meet its criteria for profitability  risk  and diversification 
o secondly  the goal is to grow earnings internally at energy group s fuel oil delivery companies  griffith and scasco  by expanding profitable product lines 
at central hudson  increased revenues  which are tied to the growing economy of the region  will be fully taken advantage of 
o lastly  as has been done so effectively over the last five years  energy group will invest in technology  in improved internal processes  and in the training and development of its employees to continuously maintain competitive prices  higher profit margins  and customer satisfaction 
central hudson gas electric corporation a challenge to invest to meet customer expectations central hudson s contribution to earnings in totaled per share  compared to per share in the increased frequency and severity of storms in resulted in restoration expenses of million  or cents per share  which was twice the average of the last ten years 
in each case  however  investments made in more extensive tree trimming and the rebuilding of selected portions of the system reduced the impact and the duration of interruptions on central hudson s customers 
customer satisfaction increased in due largely to efforts to enhance reliability in those areas experiencing above average interruptions  improved call center performance  and an increased awareness by central hudson s customers that  on average  households in new york state pay more for electric delivery service than the prices paid by central hudson customers 
an outage management system  which enables better predictability of restoration times during storms  has also been well received by customers  who are increasingly expressing their willingness to pay more to raise the standard of reliability 
importantly  the hudson valley is one of the fastest growing regions in new york state  and it maintains an exceptionally favorable trend in employment 
population growth has been boosted by an ever increasing migration of residential customers from the new york city metropolitan area 
these new residents are attracted by the opportunities and desirable living choices in pleasant surroundings that are available in the hudson river valley within commuting distance of new york city 
central hudson s extremely favorable electric delivery pricing is a competitive advantage  and one of the important amenities that attract high tech business customers to locate in the region 
the new computer age electronic economy has dramatically increased customer expectations for higher levels of electric service reliability 
the blackout of august   which affected million people  further highlighted a compelling need to increase the capacity of the regional electric transmission grid 
so far  central hudson s electric delivery system has met the challenge 
during the last five years  central hudson has invested more than million to upgrade and expand the wires  cables and systems that deliver electricity to its customers homes and businesses 
but  the system is being strained for one basic reason the demands for service reliability and quality increase daily  as electronic devices proliferate in homes  hospitals  offices  security systems  and information networks just to name a few 
the standards of yesterday are simply not enough  as growing demands are placed on the electric delivery grid to meet the needs of an increasingly high technology economy and lifestyle 
in focused surveys  central hudson customers have expressed their willingness to pay more for enhanced reliability 
equally important  electric service reliability is an essential need for prospective high technology customers who are considering expanding or locating their businesses in this region 
additional capital will be invested to meet the expectations of current and future customers for higher standards of reliability  provided that state and federal regulators provide central hudson with a reasonable opportunity to earn a competitive return on its investment 
clearly  investments made in the transmission and distribution wire networks that deliver electricity will benefit customers in three ways first  they provide the capacity to meet the needs of a growing economy  secondly  they improve reliability 
and  lastly  they are likely to stabilize supply prices of electricity by reinforcing the transmission lines that connect this region to the lower cost sources of electricity in upstate new york  as well as neighboring power regions in the united states and canada 
central hudson enterprises corporation restructured chec  energy group s competitive business subsidiary  was restructured to focus on delivery of fuel oil  propane and related services to its  retail customers in the baltimore washington  dc metro area and in southern new england 
in  earnings from fuel delivery and services were cents per share  compared to cents per share in as part of the restructuring  expenses were reduced through consolidation  process redesign  and more effective fuel purchases 
product and service offerings are also being reevaluated to create increased margin and customer value parameters that all brands must meet in their respective markets 
business lines and service locations that do not meet these thresholds will be reformed  consolidated  or shut down 
as chec increases its effectiveness in its markets  consideration will be given to acquisitions that can be consolidated into chec s existing structure 
by  the goal is to achieve a return on shareholder equity of or more  compared to the current 
competition deregulation holding company energy group is the holding company parent corporation of central hudson and chec  as described under the caption subsidiaries of energy group in item of this k annual report 
energy group s operations are conducted through central hudson  chec  and the other competitive business subsidiaries 
energy group s common stock trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol chg 
the holding company structure was instituted to permit quick response to changes in the evolving competitive energy industry 
the structure permits the use of financing techniques that are better suited to the particular requirements  characteristics  and risks of competitive operations without affecting the capital structure or creditworthiness of central hudson 
this increases energy group s financial flexibility by allowing it to establish different capital structures for each of its individual lines of business 
chec s business plan chec s primary focus is fuel distribution and related services  and chec expects such focus to continue 
chec s fuel distribution subsidiaries  griffith and scasco  continue to explore opportunities to expand through both internal growth and acquisitions  depending on financial performance and opportunities available 
there can be no assurance that such expansion opportunities will exist  or if consummated  that they will be profitable

results of operations the following discussion and analyses include explanations of significant changes in revenues and expenses between results and results and between results and results for both energy group and central hudson 
additional information relating to changes between these years is provided in the notes 
earnings earnings per share basic of energy group s common stock are shown after provision for dividends on central hudson s preferred stock and are computed on the basis of the average number of common shares outstanding during the subject year 
the number of average shares outstanding of energy group common stock  the earnings per share basic  and the rate of return earned on average common equity are as follows average shares outstanding 
   earnings per share basic return earned on common equity consolidated basic earnings per share for energy group  were for as compared to in  an increase of 
per share 
the increase in earnings reflects a 
per share increase from central hudson operations due largely to increases in electric and natural gas net operating revenue  net of the cost of purchased electricity  natural gas and revenue taxes  an increase in the amortization of shareholder benefits relating to the sale of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets  the favorable effect of the recording of regulatory carrying charges  a reduction of interest charges and preferred stock dividends  and the positive impact of energy group s repurchases of its common stock  further described in note capitalization 
the increase in net revenues results from an increase in sales due to the colder weather experienced in the early part of and customer growth  a reduction in shared earnings  and the recording of previously deferred electric and natural gas delivery revenues to income over the months ended june  the increase in net revenues was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses  increased depreciation on utility plant assets  and the effect of non recurring income recorded in from the sale of insurance stock 
the stock was received due to the demutualization of certain insurance companies through which central hudson provided employee benefits 
earnings for chec decreased by per share resulting largely from a per share reduction relating to the net gain recorded in from the sale of ch resources 
the decrease in earnings was largely offset by an increase in earnings from operations due to increased fuel oil distribution sales attributable to the colder weather in  and the acquisition of fuel oil distribution companies in the fourth quarter of and in january  and increases in productivity and a related reduction in operating expenses 
the earnings from griffith and scasco increased from 
per share in to 
per share in a nominal gain on the sale of chec s natural gas business unit in october and the favorable impact of energy group s common stock repurchase program also partially offset the reduction in earnings 
the increase in consolidated earnings was also partially offset by a 
per share reduction in earnings mainly from the liquidation of energy group s investment program by july  and the absence of favorable state income tax adjustments recorded in related to the sale of the major generating assets that took place in proceeds from the liquidation of approximately million were reinvested in lower yield money market instruments with lower principal risk 
consolidated basic earnings per share decreased per share in when compared to this decrease resulted largely from the effect of regulatory actions taken in in conjunction with the sale of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets 
these actions included the recognition of tax benefits in  a reduction in rate base related to the sale of central hudson s interests in these assets  and an after tax contribution to central hudson s customer benefit fund in described in note regulatory matters  under the captions summary of regulatory assets and liabilities and rate proceedings electric and natural gas 
the reduction in earnings also reflects a decrease in interest and investment income due to lower cash balances and rates of return  an increase in other operating expenses for central hudson  primarily storm restoration costs due to increased storm activity in  and a decrease in central hudson s natural gas net operating revenues net of the cost of natural gas and revenue taxes resulting from lower sales due to milder weather 
the reduction in earnings per share from to was partially offset by an increase in central hudson s electric net operating revenues net of the cost of purchased electricity  fuel used in the generation of electricity  and revenue taxes  reductions in central hudson s interest charges and preferred stock dividends  and an enhancement in earnings from a non recurring item recorded by central hudson 
the increase in electric net operating revenues results primarily from increased sales  due in part to hotter weather during the summer months in interest charges and preferred stock dividends were reduced due to the redemption or repurchase of various long term debt and preferred stock issues in and using proceeds from the sale of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets 
the non recurring item is income that was recorded by central hudson in for the receipt and subsequent sale of stock related to the demutualization of certain insurance companies through which central hudson provided employee benefits 
energy group s earnings in were also enhanced by an increase in earnings from chec  largely attributable to discontinued operations described in note acquisitions  divestitures  and discontinued operations 
a net gain was realized for the may sale of ch resources 
this gain was partially offset by one time charges related to restructuring certain energy efficiency contracts and lower earnings from sales by its fuel distribution subsidiaries due to milder weather 
operating revenues total operating revenues of energy group increased million  or  in as compared to  and decreased million  or  in as compared to see the table below for details of the variations increase or decrease from prior year electric gas other total electric gas other total operating revenues in thousands customer sales       sales to other utilities      energy cost adjustment 
      deferred revenues     miscellaneous subtotal      competitive business subsidiary sales     total        sales central hudson central hudson s revenues vary seasonally in response to weather 
in particular  electric revenues peak in the summer while natural gas revenues peak in the winter 
utility sales of electricity to full service customers within central hudson s service territory  plus delivery of electricity supplied by others  increased in as compared to sales to residential customers increased  sales to commercial customers increased and sales to industrial customers increased 
the across the board increase in delivery sales was due largely to colder weather and a modest increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers 
billing heating degree days were higher than last year and higher than normal 
utility sales of natural gas to firm central hudson customers  plus transportation of gas supplied by others  increased in as compared to the prior year 
residential and commercial sales  primarily space heating sales  both increased by due to the colder weather experienced in and modest growth in the average number of customers 
industrial sales  representing approximately of total firm sales in and in  decreased slightly by 
interruptible sales decreased due to a reduction in the sale of natural gas for electric generation and to the curtailment of interruptible service to meet increased demand from firm customers 
for  sales of electricity to full service customers  plus delivery of electricity supplied by others  increased as compared to sales to residential customers increased and sales to commercial customers increased reflecting  in part  an increase in electricity usage due to hotter summer weather in cooling degree days in were higher than in sales to industrial customers increased  reflecting  in substantial part  a significant increase in usage by a single large industrial customer 
for  sales of firm natural gas  plus transportation of natural gas supplied by others  decreased as compared to the prior year 
residential sales decreased while sales to commercial customers decreased 
such sales  comprised largely of sales for heating  decreased primarily as a result of milder weather as billing heating degree days in were lower than in industrial sales  representing approximately of total firm sales in and  decreased while interruptible sales increased 
changes in sales from the prior year by major customer classification  including interruptible natural gas sales  are set forth below 
also included are the changes related to electricity delivery 
increase decrease from prior year electric mwh natural gas mcf 
residential commercial industrial interruptible n a n a mwh means megawatt hour 
mcf means thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
because of sharing arrangements established for interruptible natural gas sales and interruptible transportation of customer owned natural gas  as described under the caption incentive arrangements below  variations in these sales from year to year typically have a minimal impact on earnings 
incentive arrangements under certain earnings sharing formulas approved by the psc  central hudson either shares with its customers certain revenues and or cost savings exceeding predetermined levels  or is penalized in some cases for shortfalls from certain performance standards 
earnings sharing formulas are currently effective for interruptible natural gas sales  natural gas capacity release transactions  natural gas reliability  electric service reliability  certain aspects of customer service and satisfaction  and certain aspects of market participant satisfaction 
see note regulatory matters  under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas for a description of earnings sharing formulas approved by the psc for central hudson 
the net results of these and previous earnings sharing formulas also had the effect of increasing pretax earnings by million  million  and million during   and  respectively  above the applicable sharing thresholds 
sales and revenues competitive business subsidiaries sales chec s sales of petroleum products increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons in from million gallons during this increase was primarily due to colder weather as evidenced by a average increase in heating degree days for as compared to  and increased sales as a result of acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of and in january in  chec s sales of natural gas decreased by approximately  mcf  or  to  mcf  as compared to  mcf in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of certain assets and liabilities of scasco s natural gas business unit on october  in  sales of petroleum products increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in this increase was the result of acquisitions 
in  sales of natural gas increased by  mcf  or  to million mcf from million mcf in this increase was due to customer growth 
revenues total revenues net of weather derivative contracts increased million from million in to million in revenues from petroleum products increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was the result of increased sales volumes as a result of acquisitions in the fourth quarter of and january and colder weather in as compared to in  natural gas revenues increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was due primarily to higher wholesale prices for natural gas in partially offsetting the increase was a million reduction in revenues from chec s retail electric program which chec terminated in total revenues for chec decreased from million in to million in the reduction in revenues reflects  in substantial part  the impact of the sale of ch resources  which was sold in may revenues and expenses for ch resources were eliminated from the results of continuing operations beginning december in accordance with accounting principles relating to discontinued operations 
ch resources cumulative net operating loss and the gain on its sale are reported separately from the results of continuing operations in energy group s consolidated income statement 
the overall decrease in revenues was partially offset by revenues from increased sales of petroleum products due to acquisitions of fuel distribution businesses in the latter part of in  revenues from petroleum products increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was the result of increased sales volumes as a result of acquisitions 
in  natural gas revenues increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was due to increased sales volume 
operating expenses central hudson the most significant elements of central hudson s operating expenses are purchased electricity and purchased natural gas 
in  approximately of every revenue dollar related to sales of electricity was expended for the combined cost of fuel used in electric generation and purchased electricity 
the corresponding percentage for the cost of purchased natural gas related to sales of natural gas was 
approximately in and in of every revenue dollar related to sales of electricity was expended for the combined cost of fuel used in electric generation and purchased electricity 
the corresponding figures for the cost of purchased natural gas related to sales of natural gas were and  respectively 
central hudson negotiated multi year electricity purchase contracts with the new owners of the major generating assets it divested 
these purchases are supplemented by purchases from the nyiso and other parties 
for information regarding these electricity purchase contracts  see item of this k annual report under the subcaption load and capacity  note regulatory matters  under the caption sales of major generating assets and note nine mile plant 
total utility operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in purchased electricity and purchased natural gas increased by a total of million due primarily to increases in the wholesale cost of these commodities 
the balance of operating expenses  including income taxes  increased million  reflecting a significant increase in costs related to central hudson s reliability and economic development programs that are funded by the customer benefit fund see note regulatory matters for discussion on customer benefit fund 
the rise in operating expenses also reflects increases in storm restoration and other electric distribution and maintenance costs  uncollectible accounts  property and other insurance costs  property taxes  and employee compensation and welfare costs 
operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in purchased electricity and fuel used in electric generation increased by million  primarily as a result of the sale of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets in january and november of purchased electricity costs for reflect the purchase of substantially all of central hudson s energy requirements  compared to of these requirements in the increase in electric sales also contributed to the increase in these costs 
partially offsetting the increase in operating expenses is the elimination of operating costs for central hudson s major generating assets and a reduction in purchased natural gas costs reflecting both lower commodity prices and a reduction in sales 
operating expenses chec chec s operating expenses for increased million  or  from million in to million in operating expenses are primarily the cost of petroleum and natural gas  which increased million for compared to  due primarily to higher sales by griffith and scasco as a result of colder weather in the first quarter of and acquisitions made in the fourth quarter of and in january the cost of petroleum and natural gas also increased due to higher wholesale market prices 
other operating expenses increased primarily as a result of increased distribution costs and income taxes due to these increased sales and acquisitions 
operating expenses for chec decreased million  from million in to million in  largely as a result of the sale of ch resources 
this decrease was partially offset by increased operating expenses due to additional acquisitions of fuel oil distribution companies 
the cost of purchased petroleum products increased by million  or  to million from million in from increased sales due to acquisitions of fuel oil distribution companies 
the cost of natural gas increased by million  or  to million from million in due to an increase in sales 
other income other income for energy group for decreased million due primarily to the liquidation of its alternate investment program portfolio of securities by july and the reinvestment of approximately million into lower yield  but lower risk  money market instruments 
for discussion of the alternate investment program  see financing program of energy group and its subsidiaries in item of this k annual report 
the reduction is also attributable to favorable new york state income tax adjustments recorded in for central hudson  other income increased million in mainly reflecting increases in the amortization of shareholder benefits relating to the sale of central hudson s interest in its major generating assets and the accrual of regulatory carrying charges on accumulated balances related to pension credits in customer rates 
the increases were partially offset by a reduction in interest income resulting primarily from a decrease in temporary cash investments and the early settlement of a balance due to central hudson from the sale of its interest in the nine mile plant 
also offsetting the increase was the effect of non recurring income recorded in that related to the sale of the stock of certain insurance companies through which central hudson provided employee benefits 
expiring amortization under a prior psc regulatory settlement related to the sales of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets  a portion of the gain recognized on the sales is being recorded as net income over a four year period which commenced in amounts recorded or to be recorded by year  net of tax  are as follows million  million  million  and million 
energy group is seeking to use its cash reserves and debt capacity to make investments with a view to produce new earnings intended to replace  in whole or in part  the income from the sales of central hudson s major generating assets 
in this connection  energy group is actively seeking new energy related investments that provide diversification and offer attractive returns with acceptable risks 
such opportunities may include  but are not limited to  currently operating assets that use proven technology and have a relatively stable customer base such as electric generating plants and natural gas pipelines  in either case with a significant portion of their output under long term contract 
energy group also may use its cash reserves to repurchase shares of its common stock 
such repurchases  depending on the number and average price of shares repurchased  could have the effect of offsetting a substantial portion of the earnings per share impact of the expiring amortization noted above 
in  interest charges and preferred stock dividends for energy group and central hudson decreased million and million  respectively  due primarily to a decrease in regulatory carrying charges accrued on a declining customer benefit fund balance and the redemption and repurchases of higher cost long term debt and preferred stock issues by central hudson in and in  other income for central hudson decreased million as compared to primarily reflecting the net effect of favorable tax benefits related to the sale of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets and the after tax contribution to central hudson s customer benefit fund  both recorded in the reduction also reflects a decrease in interest and investment income 
other income for energy group decreased million in reflecting the above and an additional reduction in interest and investment income due primarily to lower balances available for investment 
interest charges and preferred stock dividends for energy group and central hudson decreased million and million  respectively  in due primarily to redemptions and repurchases of various long term debt and preferred stock issues by central hudson in and utilizing proceeds from the sale of central hudson s interests in its major generating assets 
the reduction of energy group s interest charges also reflects the repayment of debt in the following table sets forth some of the pertinent data on energy group s outstanding debt unless noted otherwise  this debt relates to central hudson in thousands long term debt debt retired    outstanding at year end amount including current portion    estimated effective interest rate

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risks for energy group and its subsidiaries are commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk  related primarily to purchases of natural gas  electricity  and petroleum products for resale is mitigated in several different ways 
central hudson  under the agreement  collects its actual purchased electricity and natural gas costs through automatic adjustment clauses in its rates 
these adjustment clauses provide for the collection of costs  including risk management costs  from customers to reflect the actual costs incurred in obtaining supply 
risk management costs are defined by the psc as costs associated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or reduce overall costs to customers 
these costs include transaction costs  and gains and losses associated with risk management instruments 
griffith and scasco may increase the prices charged for the commodities they sell in response to changes in costs  however  the ability to raise prices is limited by the competitive market 
depending on market conditions  central hudson  griffith  and scasco enter into long term fixed supply and long term forward supply contracts for the purchase of these commodities 
central hudson also uses natural gas storage facilities  which enable it to purchase and hold quantities of natural gas at pre heating season prices for use during the heating season 
central hudson and the competitive business subsidiaries have in place an energy risk management program to manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  various risks associated with their respective operations  namely commodity price risk and sales volatility due to weather 
this risk management program permits the use of derivative financial instruments for hedging purposes and does not permit their use for trading or speculative purposes 
central hudson  griffith  and scasco have entered into either exchange traded futures contracts or over the counter otc contracts with third parties to hedge commodity price risk associated with the purchase of natural gas  electricity  and petroleum products and also  to hedge the effect on earnings due to significant variances in weather conditions from normal patterns 
the types of derivative instruments used include natural gas futures and basis swaps to hedge natural gas purchases  contracts for differences to hedge electricity purchases  put and call options to hedge oil purchases  and weather derivatives 
otc derivative transactions are entered into only with counter parties that meet certain credit criteria 
the creditworthiness of these counter parties is determined primarily by reference to published credit ratings

interest rate risk largely affects central hudson and is managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities and variable rate debt for which interest is reset on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the difference between costs associated with actual variable interest rates related to central hudson s bonds issued by the new york state energy research development authority nyserda and costs embedded in customer rates is deferred for eventual refund to  or recovery from  customers 
the variability in interest rates is also managed with the use of a derivative financial instrument  known as an interest rate cap agreement  for which the premium cost and any realized benefits also pass through the aforementioned regulatory recovery mechanism 
central hudson also repurchases or redeems existing debt at a lower cost when market conditions permit
