item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan  predict  potential  believe  should and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appearing throughout our k are statements regarding our intent  belief  or current expectations  primarily regarding our operations 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including those set forth under business and additional business risks  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview was an important year for onyx as we realigned our resources and placed an increased priority on the development of bay with our collaborator bayer  we began a pivotal phase iii clinical trial for the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer 
as a result  we received a million creditable milestone based payment from bayer upon the initiation of the first phase iii clinical trial in the program 
prior to june  in addition to our small molecule program  we were developing therapeutic viruses that selectively replicate in cells with cancer causing genetic mutations 
in june  we discontinued this program and terminated all internal research activities 
as a first step  in january  we suspended the development of the lead product candidate in the therapeutic virus program  onyx  including clinical trials and manufacturing activities 
the january and june actions resulted in a reduction in force of approximately positions  most of which were associated with the therapeutic virus program 
during  we recorded aggregate charges of million associated with both restructurings 
these charges consisted of million related to employee severance benefits and million related to the early termination of a process development and manufacturing agreement with xoma us llc 
in addition  we incurred aggregate charges of million related to the discontinued use of a portion of our leased facilities and the disposal of certain property and equipment 
while we anticipate that the restructuring activities in january and june will reduce our future operating expenses  we expect that these savings will be fully offset by our share of the increased codevelopment costs for bay as the compound progresses through phase iii clinical trials 
in february  we raised net proceeds of million in a private placement primarily with deerfield management company  inc we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in july and august  we raised net cash proceeds of million in a public offering of our common stock 
we sold  shares at per share pursuant to an effective registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
subsequent to year end  in february  we raised net cash proceeds of million in another public offering of our common stock 
we sold  shares at per share pursuant to an effective registration statement previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
proceeds from these offerings will be used primarily for working capital purposes  with a priority on the clinical development and commercialization activities of bay  general administrative support and general corporate purposes  including possible acquisition of products or technologies 
we have not been profitable since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future  primarily due to expenses associated with the development and commercialization of bay we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the bay clinical trials  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition 
table of contents from other products 
we currently have no products that have received marketing approval  and we have generated no revenues from the sale of products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from the sale of proposed products in the foreseeable future 
we expect that all of our revenues in the foreseeable future  if any  will be generated from collaboration agreements 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimations used in included estimated charges related to our restructuring and assumptions used in the determination of stock based compensation related to stock options granted to non employees 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
research and development expense in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  supplies and materials  and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a significant portion of our research and development expenses  approximately percent in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represent our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
such amounts are recorded based on invoices and other information we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
in addition  research and development costs incurred by us and reimbursed by bayer are recorded as a reduction to research and development expense 
results of operations years ended december   and total revenue 
total revenue was million in  million in and zero in total revenue in both and primarily included amounts received for collaboration revenue from warner lambert 
revenue of million reflected reimbursement for the therapeutic virus program research and development activities and for small molecule research funding 
total revenue of million reflected research funding for the therapeutic virus collaboration 
the small molecule research collaboration concluded in  and the therapeutic virus collaboration was terminated in our revenue was zero 
currently  we do not expect to record any revenue in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  a net decrease of million  or percent  from in  expenses for our therapeutic virus program decreased by million from levels as a result of the january and june restructuring that discontinued the therapeutic virus program development activities and terminated all internal research activities 
the decrease in the therapeutic virus expenses was partially offset by increased expenses related to onyx s share of the codevelopment costs with bayer for bay the increase in bay expenses amounted to million in over bay development costs reflect multiple ongoing phase i clinical trials  phase ii clinical trials initiated in the second half of and a phase iii clinical trial initiated in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses were million in 
table of contents  a net increase of million  or percent  from in  expenses related to the codevelopment of bay with bayer increased over levels by million due to multiple ongoing phase i clinical trials initiated in july and phase ii clinical trials initiated in the second half of earlier stage small molecule research programs  which were terminated in  accounted for reductions in expenses of million from levels 
future cost savings from the discontinuation of our therapeutic virus program are expected to be offset by increased costs associated with advancing the clinical development of bay the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  supplies and materials  and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase i  ii and iii clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development results in increasing expenditures  and the timing for completion of these steps is uncertain 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and cost of completing a product development phase  see the additional business risks section of this report 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  collabo phase of development product description rator estimated completion in millions bay small molecule inhibitor of tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis  targeting raf kinase  vegfr and pdgfr bayer phase i phase ii unknown phase iii unknown therapeutic virus program p selective replicating virus rb selective replicating virus rb selective replicating virus armed with anticancer genes phase ii iii preclinical preclinical cell cycle kinases small molecule inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase warner lambert preclinical other other small molecule research total research and development expenses program discontinued during the second quarter of see note to our financial statements 
warner lambert is responsible for research and development costs 
programs discontinued in the overall completion dates of our major research and development programs are estimates based on current information 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due 
table of contents to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing 
these risks and uncertainties make the reliable estimate of overall completion dates and total costs to complete development highly speculative 
for additional discussion of factors affecting overall completion dates and total costs  see the additional business risks section of this report 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of  or percent  from the increase was primarily due to an increase in corporate development consulting expenses and stock based compensation expense related to consultant stock option grants 
the increase to stock based compensation expense was caused in part by the increase in our stock price in compared with general and administrative expenses were million in  a decrease of  or percent  from the decrease was primarily related to a decline in employee related expenses as a result of a restructuring and staff reductions at the end of we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in may increase slightly from expenses due to additional hiring 
restructuring 
prior to june  in addition to our small molecule program  we were developing therapeutic viruses that selectively replicate in cells with cancer causing genetic mutations 
in june  we announced that we were discontinuing this program and terminating all internal research activities 
the decision was part of a business realignment that placed an increased priority on the development of bay as a first step in this realignment  in january  we suspended the development of onyx  including clinical trials and manufacturing activities 
together these actions resulted in a reduction in force of approximately positions  most of which were associated with the therapeutic virus program 
during  we recorded aggregate charges of million associated with the january and june restructurings 
these charges consist of million related to employee severance benefits and million related to the early termination of a process development and manufacturing agreement with xoma us llc 
in addition  we incurred aggregate charges of million related to the discontinued use of a portion of our leased facilities and the disposal of certain property and equipment 
we reclassified  from property and equipment to other current assets for equipment held for sale at december  had this equipment not been reclassified to other current assets  we would have recorded an additional  of depreciation expense in we anticipate that the restructuring activities in january and june will reduce our future operating expenses  however  these savings are expected to be fully offset by our share of the increased codevelopment costs for bay as the compound progresses through phase iii clinical trials 
there were no restructuring expenses in fiscal year in october  we formally adopted and announced a restructuring plan aimed at reducing future operating costs 
we recognized  of restructuring charges in the last quarter of of the   related to the impairment of certain long lived assets   related to employee termination costs  and  related to office closure costs 
we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately positions  primarily impacting the research and administrative functions 
employee termination costs consisted of wage continuation and advance notice pay 
office closure costs included losses on operating leases and asset impairments including leasehold improvements related to vacated facilities and equipment related to research and development programs not expected to continue 
interest income and expense  net 
we had net interest income of  in  a decrease of  from  primarily due to lower average interest rates 
we had net interest income of million in  a decrease of million from  primarily due to lower average cash and investment balances 
other income expense related party 
in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx  inc assets from our small molecules discovery program  including drug targets  related reagents and assays  compound libraries and certain intellectual property rights in exchange for preferred stock valued at  the entire amount was recorded as other income related party on the date of sale 
the value of the preferred stock was initially determined based on similar sales of syrrx preferred stock to unrelated third parties for cash 
in  due to a further round of financing completed by syrrx  we recorded  as other expense related party to recognize a permanent impairment in the carrying value of the investment 

table of contents in  based on a further round of financing completed by syrrx in april  we recorded an additional impairment charge of  as other expense related party to reduce the carrying value of the investment 
we consider the reduction in value of the syrrx investment to be other than temporary 
at the time of the transactions mentioned above  a member of the board of directors of onyx was a director and officer of syrrx 
this board member is no longer an officer of syrrx 
other income 
in  we licensed assets from our small molecules discovery program to a third party for  this amount was recorded as other income 
no similar items were recorded in fiscal years and income taxes since our inception  we have incurred operating losses and accordingly have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented and since inception 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were approximately million and for state income tax purposes were approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
realization of these deferred tax assets are dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they can be used 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
related party transactions in march  we issued and sold  shares of common stock to warner lambert in a private placement  at a price of per share  for aggregate proceeds of million 
we record related party revenue under our collaboration agreements with warner lambert 
please read note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this form k for further information 
in november  we sold and licensed to syrrx assets from our small molecules discovery program in exchange for syrrx preferred stock valued at  we could also receive royalties on pharmaceutical products resulting from these assets 
at the time of the transaction mentioned above  a member of the board of directors of onyx was a director and officer of syrrx 
this board member is no longer an officer of syrrx 
in may  we issued and sold  shares of common stock in a private placement to a current shareholder and several new investors  at a price of per share  for gross proceeds of million 
we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
a member of our board of directors is a managing member of domain associates  llc  one of the participants in the private placement 
we have a loan with a former employee of which approximately  was outstanding at december  and this loan bears interest at per annum  however  we have forgiven  of interest over the term of the loan through december  liquidity and capital resources since our inception  our cash expenditures have substantially exceeded our revenues  and we have relied primarily on the proceeds from the sale of equity securities and revenue from collaborative research and development agreements to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  compared to million at december   and million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million in was attributable to our public offering completed in july and august  which raised aggregate net cash proceeds of million  the 
table of contents private placement financing that we completed in february  which raised net cash proceeds of million  million received from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan  and  received from the sale of equipment 
in addition  we received a million creditable milestone based payment from bayer in december upon initiation of a phase iii clinical trial of bay this payment will be repayable to bayer from onyx s share of any profits and royalties 
these sources of cash were partially offset by cash used in operations of million and capital expenditures of  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million in was primarily attributable to cash used in operating activities of million and capital expenditures of  these uses of cash were partially offset by the private placement of common stock we completed in may  which raised net proceeds of million 
in addition  we received a million creditable milestone based payment from bayer in august upon initiation of phase ii clinical trials of bay this payment will be repayable to bayer from onyx s share of any profits and royalties 
our cash used in operations was million in  million in and million in the cash was used primarily for cofunding clinical development costs with bayer for bay and to fund development expenses including manufacturing and clinical trial costs for onyx expenditures for capital equipment amounted to  in  as compared to  in  and million in we currently expect to make expenditures for capital equipment and leasehold improvements of up to million in we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon  together with approximately million in net proceeds from our public offering closed in february  will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through however  if we change our development plans  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
in addition  we anticipate that our codevelopment costs for the bay program will increase over the next several years as the phase iii clinical trial program advances 
while these costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the cofunding of the program in future periods beyond we intend to seek this additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter are as follows payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases  net of sublease income this table does not include any payments under research and development collaborations  as the amount and timing of such payments are not known 
this table also does not include the obligation to repay the million creditable milestone based payments that we received from bayer  because the repayment of these amounts is contingent upon onyx generating profits or royalties on any products 
whether onyx will ever generate any profits or royalties is not known at this time 
we have leases for  square feet of office and laboratory space in our main facility and  square feet of space in a secondary facility in richmond  california 
in december  we determined that we no longer required the secondary facility as a result of a reduction in force 
in september  we entered into a sublease agreement for this facility through september  which is also the lease expiration date for this space 
we are currently seeking a subtenant for a portion of our primary facilities 
any amounts we may receive under this additional subleasing arrangement have not been considered in the table above 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred 
previous guidance in emerging issues task force  eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring required that a liability for an exit cost be recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we adopted sfas on january  and recorded our january and june restructurings in accordance with the provisions of sfas in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin  as amended  requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the quarter ending march  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
