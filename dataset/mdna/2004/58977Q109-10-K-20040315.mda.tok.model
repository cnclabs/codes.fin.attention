item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general meridian is an independent oil and natural gas company that explores for  acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties utilizing d seismic technology 
our operations are focused on the onshore oil and gas regions in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico 
our reserves and strategic acreage position provide us with a significant presence in our areas of focus  enabling us to manage a large asset base and to add successful exploratory and development wells at relatively low incremental costs 
as of december   we had proved reserves of bcfe  approximately of which were natural gas  with a present value of future pre tax cash flows pv of million 
we own interests in approximately  gross  net acres  including fields and wells  and we operate approximately of our total production 
the company s business model utilizing d seismic technology to explore for large reserve accumulations in areas where others have overlooked or not encountered commercial hydrocarbons because of the inability to resolve structures or recognize hydrocarbon indicators with traditional d seismic data  has proven successful 
during the period of  meridian generated and participated in the discovery of approximately bcfe of natural gas and oil 
as demonstrated from the apparent declines in domestic production  fewer and fewer economic projects are being recognized by the domestic industry 
this is partly a result of better technology that has improved the industry s ability to determine probabilities of success  thereby impacting the number of economic prospects available for drilling 
in addition  the conditions of the industry price volatility and uncertainty as well as declining prospect opportunities and the overall economy have influenced the availability of debt and equity capital for small capitalization companies such as meridian 
this  combined with the geological geophysical and mechanical risks associated with drilling primarily deep  high pressured wells with large working interests  has resulted in a shift in the company s strategy for exploration 
recognizing the trend and risks resulting therefrom  beginning in  management embarked on its current strategy to continue to utilize its application of d seismic technology to generate and drill shallower  higher confidence  lower risk plays  such as its biloxi marshlands project in st 
bernard parish  louisiana  blended with its traditional deeper  higher risk  but higher potential opportunities where its capital expenditure budget permits 
we have a large  balanced inventory of exploration  exploitation and development drilling prospects in our producing region 
in addition to a solid reserve base and acreage position in our area of focus  we believe we possess the technical knowledge and information necessary to sustain successful growth 
with licenses and rights to approximately  square miles of d seismic data and  linear miles of d seismic data  our technical and professional staff is in a position to continue to generate future prospects for our growth 
our strategy 
the key elements of our strategy are as follows generate reserve additions through exploration  exploitation and development drilling of a risk balanced portfolio of high potential prospects  maintain a concise geographic focus in south louisiana  the texas gulf coast and offshore in the gulf of mexico  applying professional and technical knowledge and experience to the development of a high quality project inventory  apply a disciplined methodology utilizing d seismic technology to reduce exploration risk  improve the probability of success  optimize well locations and reduce our finding costs  maximize percentage ownership in each drilling prospect relative to probability of success  increasing the impact of discoveries on shareholder value  and maintain operational control to manage quality  costs and timing of our drilling and production activities 
we use a disciplined approach in the generation of drilling projects  which forms the basis of the company s ability to grow its reserves  production and cash flow 
the company s process of review begins with a thorough analysis of each project area using traditional geological methods of prospect development  combined with computer aided technology to analyze all available d and d seismic data and other geological and geophysical data with respect to the opportunity 
in addition  from time to time  we may purchase producing properties through acquisitions that have substantial additional drilling opportunities associated with them 
the company previously announced that it intends to increase its capital budget to approximately million for or over its spending  subject to adjustments depending on drilling results  oil and natural gas prices and other factors 
during  the company turned production declines into growth with drilling successes in its core area of south louisiana where it used its proprietary d seismic to develop an inventory of low risk exploration and exploitation plays 
the results are delivering solid production increases with improved returns and enabling meridian to increase drilling activities to an expected level of wells during  primarily focused in its biloxi marshlands project area 
in addition to increased drilling activities  meridian expects to extend its proprietary d data base at biloxi marshlands with the shooting of square miles of new data  the total of which ultimately will provide over square miles covering approximately  acres in st 
bernard parish  louisiana 
the exploration drilling and seismic acquisition activities were initiated in january it is anticipated that the biloxi marshlands project area will comprise a substantial portion of the company s future drilling inventory over the next several years as it continues to work the entire d data set ranging in depths from shallow to deep for new prospect opportunities 
review of during  the company focused on corporate fundamentals financial  seismic  land and production 
the company reduced total debt million by reducing its senior bank facility from million to million and by reducing the sub debt from million to million 
in addition  outstanding preferred stock was reduced from a high of million in stated value of shares outstanding  to approximately million as a result of conversions to common stock 
by year end  the company s debt to book capitalization had been reduced from to 
in addition  during  six wells were brought on line increasing production from mmcfe per day to the current range of mmcfe to mmcfe per day 
with the drilling results of last year  coupled with completion of our square mile d seismic survey  and added cash flows  meridian expects to increase its drilling activities four to five fold  to wells during growth in reserves  as in prior years  in a very high priority for the company in recent developments 
during the first quarter of the company entered into a conversion agreement with kayne anderson to convert million of their convertible subordinated notes to common stock 
in addition  the company has made million in debt repayments and anticipates further simplifying its capital structure and reducing total outstanding debt by million during  based on current projections of commodity prices  production levels and the current stock price 
in furthering its objective of organic reserve growth  the company is continuing to develop its biloxi marshlands play 
to date the company has drilled eight wells  five of which have been completed and are producing at a gross rate of approximately mmcfe per day 
the company has also reached total depth on its sixth successful well in its biloxi marshlands project area and expects to place it on production by may  the biloxi marshlands no 
well was drilled to a total depth of  feet md and electric logs have been run and indicate apparent gas pay in the targeted cris i sand interval with an overall gross pay section of feet md 
meridian holds a working interest in the well and is the operator of the field 
also  during the first quarter of  the company drilled the lake eugene land development no 
well in its biloxi marshlands project area and did not encounter commercial production in the well 
the well was drilled to test a deeper rob l sand interval target at a total depth of  feet md 
while the well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons  the company believes many other rob l sand interval targets exist within its biloxi marshlands project area  only one of which was scheduled for during the last several months  the company has participated in several state of louisiana oil and gas lease sales and has successfully bid on additional tracts in the area  covering  acres in and around our current lease holdings 
these new tracts together with the company s land acreage position provides the opportunity to drill or more new wells during in our biloxi project area 
in an effort to further its development in the biloxi project area for future years  the company began the third phase of its d seismic program in january this approximately square mile d seismic survey is expected to be completed in may although meridian s focus is currently on the cris i geological time horizon  the survey is designed to look at all shallow and for deep objectives 
with the successful completion to the myles salt st well  we continue to develop new opportunities in our weeks island field 
currently  we are drilling the weeks island sand unit a no 
well the wisu a  and have logged an overall gross pay section of feet md with feet md being net apparent oil pay 
the company has drilled to a measured depth of  feet and  based on electric logs  encountered oil pay in the m and o sand intervals between depths of  and  feet md 
the company is currently setting casing through the oil pay section and once casing is set  will drill ahead to test deeper o and p sand intervals 
the test of the deeper intervals is expected to take approximately ten days after which the company will begin completion operations and expects to have the well on production early in the second quarter of the company anticipates that the results of wisu a well will further define other drilling opportunities in the weeks island field through the remainder of the company owns a working interest in the wisu a well 
the company has currently scheduled several more wells in this field for also in the weeks island field  the company has completed workover operations on the myles salt company no 
well and re established production in the o sand interval at rates of approximately barrels of oil per day 
prior to the workover  the myles salt no 
was producing at significantly lower rates 
the company is currently performing workover operations on the myles salt company no 
well to replace corroded tubing and expects to return the well to production at rates similar to the rates in the myles salt no 
the company has identified several other high potential workovers in the weeks island field 
industry conditions 
our revenues  profitability and cash flow are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
oil and natural gas prices have been extremely volatile in recent years and are affected by many factors outside of our control 
the average price we received during the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe during the year ended december  fluctuations in prevailing prices for oil and natural gas have several important consequences to us  including affecting the level of cash flow received from our producing properties  the timing of exploration of certain prospects and our access to capital markets  which could impact our revenues  profitability and ability to maintain or increase our exploration and development program 
refer to item a for a discussion of commodity price risk management activities utilized to mitigate a portion of the near term effects of this exposure to price volatility 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues increased million  primarily as a result of an increase in average commodity prices 
the following table summarizes meridian s operating revenues  production volumes and average sales prices for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease production oil mbbls   natural gas mmcf   natural gas equivalent mmcfe   average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe gross revenues s oil   natural gas   total   operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in lease operating expenses reflect savings realized on sold properties combined with other cost savings offset by additional operating expenses associated with the biloxi marshlands project area 
on a unit basis  lease operating expenses decreased per mcfe to per mcfe for the year from per mcfe for the year in  our anticipated future increases in production should result in a continued reduction in operating costs on a per unit level 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease is largely attributable to the decrease in the average tax rate for natural gas and the decrease in oil revenues from the levels  partially offset by an increase in natural gas production 
meridian s production is primarily from southern louisiana  and  therefore  is subject to a current tax rate of of gross oil revenues and per mcf for natural gas effective july 
the tax rate for natural gas for the first half of was per mcf and from july through june was per mcf 
on an equivalent unit of production basis  severance and ad valorem taxes decreased to per mcfe from per mcfe for the comparable period 
the per mcfe cost for will increase due to a higher anticipated severance tax rate than what was experienced in depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense increased million to million in from million for this increase was primarily a result of an increased depletion rate from levels  partially offset by the decrease in production on an mcfe basis from the comparable period in on a unit basis  depletion and depreciation expenses increased to per mcfe for  compared to per mcfe for the increase in the depletion rate is primarily a result of the impairment of long lived assets mentioned below 
we are expecting a downward trend in our depletion rate as we find and develop new reserves during the year 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the year as previously announced  during the first quarter of the company initiated reductions in staff to reflect a change in exploration strategy to lower risk  higher probability projects  maintaining focus in south louisiana and southeast texas 
although the full impact of these reductions has not been fully recognized due to the severance packages included  it is anticipated that these changes will result in future savings in costs without sacrificing the company s exploration efforts or opportunities 
in addition to the reduction in staff during the year  professional services decreased partially offset by an increase in insurance costs primarily for company directors and officers 
on an equivalent unit of production basis  general and administrative expenses were comparable for the two years 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease is primarily a result of the reduction in long term debt by million and the federal reserve bank s decrease in overall interest rates which has led to a decrease in the average interest rate on the revolving credit facilities 
the funds for the reduction in debt were the result of the august stock offering  improved cash flow from operations and the sale of certain non strategic oil and gas properties 
impairment of long lived assets 
in  a write down in oil and natural gas proved undeveloped reserves resulted in the company recognizing a non cash impairment of million of its oil and natural gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
this was due to a negative revision associated with an unsuccessful well drilled in the kent bayou field in if oil and natural gas price were to significantly drop during  the risk of future impairments exists 
credit facility retirement costs 
during august  the company replaced its chase manhattan bank credit facility with a new three year million underwritten senior secured agreement with societe generale and fortis capital corp 
deferred debt costs associated with the prior credit facility of million were written off in september taxes on income 
the provision for income taxes for is million 
income taxes were provided on book income after taking into account permanent differences between book income and taxable income  and after reducing the income tax valuation allowance by million 
the income tax for was a credit of million 
this credit resulted from the book loss after taking into account permanent differences between book income and taxable income 
this credit was limited to the amount of the company s deferred tax liability at december  adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
as a result  the company recorded a long term liability of million representing the discounted present value of the estimated retirement obligations and an increase in capitalized oil and gas properties of million 
the liability will be accreted to its future value in subsequent reporting periods and will be charged to earnings on the company s consolidated statement of operations as accretion expense 
as a result of adoption of sfas no 
 the company has charged approximately million to earnings as accretion expense during the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle for prior years totaled million or per share  and was charged to earnings in the first quarter of year ended december   compared to year ended december  oil and natural gas revenues decreased million as a result of decreased production volumes and a decrease in average commodity prices 
the production decrease was primarily a result of the property sales completed during  hurricane related production losses and natural production declines  partially offset by the inclusion of new wells being placed on production 
the following table summarizes meridian s operating revenues  production volumes and average sales prices for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease production oil mbbls   natural gas mmcf   natural gas equivalent mmcfe   average sales price oil per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe gross revenues s oil   natural gas   total   interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased million to million in  compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to a lower average amount of invested funds and lower interest rates during than in a significant portion of the interest income for was earned on the investment of funds accumulated from the sale of properties and a common stock offering during these funds had been accumulated to exercise the option to buy back the company s preferred stock and six million shares of the company s common stock from shell on january  operating expenses 
oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of high cost  non core properties during and the reorganization of field operations over the last thirteen months partially offset by the inclusion of costs associated with returning the company s properties to production following hurricanes 
this reorganization involved a reduction in field operating personnel and increased emphasis on operating cost reductions 
in addition  the company undertook an expanded well workover program during in order to benefit from the higher commodity prices being realized at the time 
severance and ad valorem taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased million to million in  compared to million in this decrease is largely attributable to the decrease in natural gas production and the decrease in oil revenues from the levels  partially offset by an increase in the average tax rate for natural gas 
meridian s production is primarily from southern louisiana  and  therefore  is subject to a current tax rate of of gross oil revenues and per mcf for natural gas 
the tax rate for natural gas for the first half of was per mcf and from july through june was per mcf 
depletion and depreciation 
depletion and depreciation expense decreased million to million in from million for this decrease was primarily a result of the decrease in production on an mcfe basis from  partially offset by an increase in the depletion rate from levels primarily due to the write down of the proved reserves associated with the kent bayou field 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the year this reduction was primarily due to the savings realized from staff reductions and the purchase and termination of certain outstanding well bonus plan interests at the end of interest expense 
interest expense decreased million to million in compared to million for the decrease is primarily a result of the reduction in the debt balance and the federal reserve bank s decrease in overall interest rates which has led to a decrease in the average interest rate on the revolving credit facility 
full cost ceiling writedown 
during  a negative revision in oil and natural gas proved undeveloped reserves associated with an unsuccessful well drilled in the kent bayou field resulted in the company recognizing a full cost ceiling write down of its oil and natural gas properties totaling million million after tax 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices caused us to recognize million in full cost ceiling write downs during credit facility retirement costs 
during  the company replaced its chase manhattan bank credit facility with a new three year million underwritten senior secured credit agreement with societe generale and fortis capital corp 
deferred debt costs associated with the prior credit facility of million were written off in fliquidity and capital resources cash flows 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in revenue due to price increases 
the year over year change in operating assets and liability from december   to december   also accounted for approximately million of increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in capital expenditures of million  coupled with the selling of a non strategic field for million 
net cash flows used in financing activities were million for the year ended december   as compared to net cash flows provided from financing activities of million 
during  the company retired million in long term debt  partially offset by the million raised by selling common stock 
during  the company raised million by selling redeemable preferred stock which funded the retirement of million in long term debt and capital expenditures in excess of net cash flows provided by operating activities 
credit facility 
during august  the company replaced its chase manhattan bank credit facility with a new three year million underwritten senior secured credit agreement the credit agreement with societe generale as administrative agent  lead arranger and book runner  and fortis capital corporation  as co lead arranger and documentation agent 
borrowings under the credit agreement mature on august  the borrowing base is currently set at million and is scheduled to be redetermined and be effective on april  credit facility payments of million were made during  bringing the outstanding balance to million as of december  during the first two months of  the company made million in additional debt repayments and anticipates that it will continue to make debt repayments during the remainder of the year 
in addition to the scheduled quarterly borrowing base redeterminations  the lenders or borrower  under the credit agreement  have the right to redetermine the borrowing base at any time  once during each calendar year 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by pledges of outstanding capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and a mortgage on the company s oil and natural gas properties of at least of its present value of proved properties 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants  including  among other items  maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on cash dividends on common stock and under certain circumstances preferred stock  and an unqualified audit report on the company s consolidated financial statements beginning with those as of and for the year ended december  the auditor s report on the consolidated financial statements contained a going concern modification 
the company obtained a waiver of the related covenant that would have triggered a violation of the loan agreement 
under the credit agreement  the company may secure either i an alternative base rate loan that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate  plus an additional to depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base or a federal funds based rate plus of or  ii a eurodollar base rate loan that bears interest  generally  at a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus to  depending on the ratio of the aggregate outstanding loans and letters of credit to the borrowing base 
at december   the three month libor interest rate was 
the credit agreement also provides for commitment fees ranging from to per annum 
subordinated credit agreement 
the company extended and amended a short term subordinated credit agreement with fortis capital corporation for million on april   with a maturity date of december  the interest rate is libor plus through december   libor plus from january   through august   and libor plus from september   through december  at december   the three month libor interest rate was 
a note payment of million is due on april   with the remaining million payable on december  note payments totaling million were paid in the outstanding balance is million as of december  convertible subordinated notes 
during june  we completed private placements of an aggregate of million of our convertible subordinated notes due june  the notes are unsecured and contain customary events of default  but do not contain any maintenance or other restrictive covenants 
interest is payable on a quarterly basis 
during march  the company and the holders of the notes amended the conversion price from to per share 
the notes are convertible at any time by the holders of the notes into shares of the company s common stock  par value utilizing the conversion price 
the conversion price is subject to customary anti dilution provisions 
we may prepay the notes at any time without penalty or premium 
redeemable convertible preferred stock 
a private placement of million of redeemable convertible preferred stock was completed during may the preferred stock is convertible into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per share 
dividends are payable semi annually in cash or additional preferred stock 
at the option of the company  one third of the preferred shares can be forced to convert to common stock if the closing price of the company s common stock exceeds of the conversion price for out of consecutive trading days on the new york stock exchange 
based on the above conversion criteria  the company can elect to convert up to one third of the original issue provided that the conversion occurs no sooner than twelve months from the most recent conversion 
the preferred stock is subject to redemption at the option of the company after march  and mandatory redemption on march  the holders of the preferred stock have been granted registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the preferred stock 
in the last quarter of  million of preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock 
in addition  million of preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock during january and february dividends of million were accumulated net of million of deferred preferred stock offering costs amortized during during  of which million was satisfied with the issuance of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock  and million was paid in cash in january dividends of million were accumulated in  of which million was paid in cash and million was satisfied with the issuance of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in consisted of million for property and equipment additions primarily related to exploration and development of various prospects  including leases  seismic data acquisitions  production facilities  and related drilling and workover activities 
our strategy is to blend exploration drilling activities with high confidence workover and development projects selected from our broad asset inventory in order to capitalize on periods of high commodity prices 
this strategy brought on production and added reserves sooner than the drilling of deep  higher risk exploration wells 
the capital expenditures plan is currently forecast at approximately million 
the final projects will be determined based on a variety of factors  including prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  our expectations as to future pricing and the level of cash flow from operations 
we currently anticipate funding the plan primarily utilizing cash flow from operations 
when appropriate  excess cash flow from operations as a result of increased rates or prices beyond that needed for the capital expenditures plan will be used to de lever the company by development of exploration discoveries or direct payment of debt 
sale of properties 
during  the company sold certain non strategic oil and gas properties located in south louisiana for approximately million 
the sale was comprised of approximately bcfe proved developed reserves and bcfe of undeveloped reserves 
benefits of the sale include the reduction of total debt by an additional million resulting in an immediate savings in interest costs on the company s senior bank debt  the elimination of million in future capital expenditures associated with the properties  and the elimination of over million in annual lease operating expenses 
cash obligations 
the following summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands less than after one year years years total short and long term debt    non cancelable operating leases    total contractual cash obligations    dividends 
it is our policy to retain existing cash for reinvestment in our business  and therefore  we do not anticipate that dividends will be paid with respect to the common stock in the foreseeable future 
dividends on the redeemable preferred stock aggregating million were accrued for in of that amount  million was satisfied with the issuance of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock  and million was paid in cash in january during  million of deferred preferred stock offering costs was amortized 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements 
the company analyzes its estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its investments in oil and natural gas properties 
all costs incurred with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  including unproductive wells  are capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  such costs may be incurred both prior to or after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion and equipment 
included in capitalized costs are general and administrative costs that are directly related to acquisition  exploration and development activities  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
for the years   and  such capitalized costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
proceeds from the sale of oil and natural gas properties are credited to the full cost pool  except in transactions involving a significant quantity of reserves or where the proceeds received from the sale would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss would be recognized 
future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are estimated property by property based upon current economic conditions and are included in our amortization of our oil and natural gas property costs 
the provision for depletion and amortization of oil and natural gas properties is computed by the unit of production method 
under this computation  the total unamortized costs of oil and natural gas properties including future development  site restoration  and dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage value  excluding costs of unproved properties  are divided by the total estimated units of proved oil and natural gas reserves at the beginning of the period to determine the depletion rate 
this rate is multiplied by the physical units of oil and natural gas produced during the period 
the cost of unevaluated oil and natural gas properties not being amortized is assessed quarterly to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining impairment  an evaluation is performed on current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  and available geological and geophysical information 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarter  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties  after deducting the asset retirement obligation  net of related deferred income taxes  is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify a revision of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
during  a negative revision in oil and natural gas proved undeveloped reserves associated with the kent bayou field resulted in the company recognizing a full cost ceiling write down totaling million million after tax of its oil and natural gas properties 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices caused us to recognize million in full cost ceiling write downs during due to the inherent imprecision in estimating oil and natural gas revenues as well as the potential volatility in oil and gas prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved oil and gas reserves  there can be no assurance that write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  including volatile oil and natural gas prices  downward revisions in estimated proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
price risk management activities 
the company follows the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities which requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific cash flow hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be reported in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
cash flow hedge accounting for qualifying hedges allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the earnings statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we adopted fas effective january  the company s results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  the company has entered into various swap agreements 
these swaps allow the company to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges as provided by fas and any changes in fair value are recorded in other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item 
any changes in fair value resulting from the ineffectiveness of the hedge are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of revenues 
the company recognized minimal losses related to hedge ineffectiveness during the three years ended december  at december   the change in estimated fair value of the company s oil and natural gas swaps was an unrealized loss of million million net of tax which is recognized in other comprehensive income 
based upon december   oil and natural gas commodity prices  approximately million of the loss deferred in other comprehensive income could potentially lower gross revenues in the swap agreements expire at various dates through july  net settlements under these swap agreements reduced oil and natural gas revenues by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   the company had no material open hedging agreements 
see item a for additional discussion of disclosures about market risk 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings and subordinated notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based on quoted market prices as of the respective dates  the fair values of our subordinated notes due were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the carrying value of our subordinated notes was million at december  and new accounting pronouncements 
a reporting issue has arisen regarding the application of certain provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets to companies in the extractive industries  including oil and gas companies 
the issue is whether sfas no 
requires registrants to classify the costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangements associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets in the balance sheet  apart from other capitalized oil and gas property costs  and provide specific footnote disclosures 
historically  the company has included the costs of such mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as a component of oil and gas properties 
if it is ultimately determined that sfas no 
requires oil and gas companies to classify costs of mineral rights held under lease or other contractual arrangement associated with extracting oil and gas as a separate intangible assets line item on the balance sheet  the company would be required to reclassify approximately million at december   and million at december   respectively  out of oil and gas properties and into a separate intangible assets line item 
the company s cash flows and results of operations would not be affected since such intangible assets would continue to be depleted and assessed for impairment in accordance with full cost accounting rules 
further  the company does not believe the classification of the costs of mineral rights associated with extracting oil and gas as intangible assets would have any impact on the company s compliance with covenants under its debt agreements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made

an entity is considered to be a vie when either i the entity lacks sufficient equity to carry on its principal operations  ii the equity owners of the entity cannot make decisions about the entity s activities or iii the entity s equity neither absorbs losses or benefits from gains 
meridian owns no interests in variable interest entities  and therefore this new interpretation has not affected the company s consolidated financial statements

forward looking information from time to time  we may make certain statements that contain forward looking information as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of and that involve risk and uncertainty 
these forward looking statements may include  but are not limited to exploration and seismic acquisition plans  anticipated results from current and future exploration prospects  future capital expenditure plans  anticipated results from third party disputes and litigation  expectations regarding compliance with our credit facility  the anticipated results of wells based on logging data and production tests  future sales of production  earnings  margins  production levels and costs  market trends in the oil and natural gas industry and the exploration and development sector thereof  environmental and other expenditures and various business trends 
forward looking statements may be made by management orally or in writing including  but not limited to  the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section and other sections of our filings with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
actual results and trends in the future may differ materially depending on a variety of factors including  but not limited to the following changes in the price of oil and natural gas 
the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production and the level of such production are subject to wide fluctuations and depend on numerous factors that we do not control  including seasonality  worldwide economic conditions  the condition of the united states economy particularly the manufacturing sector  foreign imports  political conditions in other oil producing countries  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and domestic government regulation  legislation and policies 
material declines in the prices received for oil and natural gas could make the actual results differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
operating risks 
the occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas  including uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids into the environment including groundwater and shoreline contamination  blowouts  cratering  mechanical difficulties  fires  explosions  unusual or unexpected formation pressures  pollution and environmental hazards  each of which could result in damage to or destruction of oil and natural gas wells  production facilities or other property  or injury to persons 
in addition  we are subject to other operating and production risks such as title problems  weather conditions  compliance with government permitting requirements  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment  reductions in product prices  limitations in the market for products  litigation and disputes in the ordinary course of business 
although we maintain insurance coverage considered to be customary in the industry  we are not fully insured against certain of these risks either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
we cannot predict if or when any such risks could affect our operations 
the occurrence of a significant event for which we are not adequately insured could cause our actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
drilling risks 
our decision to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit a prospect or property will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis  production data and engineering studies  which are inherently imprecise 
therefore  we cannot assure you that all of our drilling activities will be successful or that we will not drill uneconomical wells 
the occurrence of unexpected drilling results could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
uncertainties in estimating reserves and future net cash flows 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating the recovery from underground accumulations of oil and natural gas we cannot measure in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of those accumulations of data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgement 
reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and may be expected to change as additional information becomes available 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond our control 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree speculative  the quantities of oil and natural gas that we ultimately recover  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
significant downward revisions to our existing reserve estimates could cause the actual results to differ from those reflected in our forward looking statements 
borrowing base for the credit facility 
the credit agreement with societe generale and fortis capital corp 
is presently scheduled for borrowing base redetermination dates on a quarterly basis  with the next such redetermination scheduled for april  the borrowing base is redetermined on numerous factors including current reserve estimates  reserves that have recently been added  current commodity prices  current production rates and estimated future net cash flows 
these factors have associated risks with each of them 
significant reductions or increases in the borrowing base will be determined by these factors  which  to a significant extent  are not under the company s control 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is from time to time exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and hedging contracts 
a discussion of the market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
interest rates we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term fixed interest rate debt and variable interest rate borrowings 
our long term borrowings primarily consist of borrowings under the credit facility and principal due december  under our subordinated credit agreement 
since interest charged borrowings under the credit facility floats with prevailing interest rates except for the applicable interest period for eurodollar loans  the carrying value of borrowings under the credit facility should approximate the fair market value of such debt 
changes in interest rates  however  will change the cost of borrowing 
assuming million remains borrowed under the credit facility and million remains borrowed under the subordinated credit agreement  we estimate our annual interest expense will change by million for each basis point change in the applicable interest rates utilized under the credit facility and million from the subordinated credit agreement 
changes in interest rates would  assuming all other things being equal  cause the fair market value of debt with a fixed interest rate  such as the notes  to increase or decrease  and thus increase or decrease the amount required to refinance the debt 
the fair value of the notes is dependent on prevailing interest rates and our current stock price as it relates to the conversion price of per share of our common stock 
hedging contracts meridian may address market risk by selecting instruments whose value fluctuations correlate strongly with the underlying commodity being hedged 
from time to time  we may enter into swaps and other derivative contracts to hedge the price risks associated with a portion of anticipated future oil and gas production 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future gains from favorable movements 
under these agreements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable product price 
these agreements are settled in cash at or prior to expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
meridian does not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitors the financial viability of counter parties and believes its credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed to price risk 
meridian has some risk of accounting loss since the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the hedging transaction 
in  we entered into certain swap agreements as summarized in the table below 
the notional amount is equal to the total net volumetric hedge position of meridian during the periods indicated 
the positions effectively hedge approximately of our proved developed natural gas production and of our proved developed oil production during the respective terms of the swap agreements 
the fair values of the cash flow hedges are based on the difference between the strike price and the new york mercantile exchange future prices for the applicable trading months 
weighted average fair value unrealized at notional strike price december  in amount per unit thousands natural gas mmbtu january june   oil bbls january july   glossary of certain oil and natural gas terms the definitions set forth below apply to the indicated terms commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and in this form k
