item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a consumer finance company specializing in purchasing retail automobile installment sales contracts originated by franchised and select independent dealers in connection with the sale of used and new automobiles 
the company generates revenue and cash flows primarily through the purchase  retention  subsequent securitization and servicing of finance receivables 
as used herein  loans include auto finance receivables originated by dealers and purchased by the company 
to fund the acquisition of receivables prior to securitization  the company uses borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities 
the company earns finance charge income on the finance receivables and pays interest expense on borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities 

table of contents the company periodically transfers receivables to securitization trusts trusts that  in turn  sell asset backed securities to investors 
prior to october   these securitization transactions were structured as sales of finance receivables 
receivables sold under this structure are referred to herein as gain on sale receivables 
the company retains an interest in the securitization transactions in the form of credit enhancement assets  representing the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by the company over the life of the securitization 
excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset backed securities  net of credit losses and expenses 
excess cash flows from the trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
once predetermined credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained  excess cash flows are distributed to the company 
credit enhancement requirements will increase if targeted portfolio performance ratios are exceeded see liquidity and capital resources section 
in addition to excess cash flows  the company earns monthly base servicing income of per annum on the outstanding principal balance of domestic receivables securitized and collects other fees  such as late charges  as servicer for securitization trusts 
the company changed the structure of its securitization transactions beginning with transactions closed subsequent to september   to no longer meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
accordingly  following a securitization  the finance receivables and the related securitization notes payable remain on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company recognizes finance charge and fee income on the receivables and interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization transaction  and records a provision for loan losses to cover probable loan losses on the receivables 
this change has significantly impacted the company s reported results of operations compared to its historical results because there is no gain on sale of receivables subsequent to september  accordingly  historical results may not be indicative of the company s future results 
prior to february  the company s business strategy was designed to achieve a high rate of growth in loan origination volume 
the increasing levels of loan originations were financed largely through the completion of securitization transactions 
excess cash flows from the company s securitizations are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements and once such requirements are reached and maintained  excess cash is distributed to the company 
in addition  agreements with fsa required that if certain portfolio performance levels on securitization transactions insured by fsa were breached  the credit enhancement requirements for those securitizations would be increased and funded through cash otherwise distributable to the company from all of its other fsa program securitizations 
as the us economy declined throughout and  and unemployment rates rose  the default rate on the company s loan portfolio increased 
in addition  the company began to experience lower recovery rates on the sale of repossessed vehicles due to a decline in used car prices at auction  which was exacerbated by aggressive new car incentives offered by auto manufacturers 
this increase in credit losses resulted in lower excess cash flows from the company s securitizations and by march resulted in a breach of cumulative net loss performance triggers on certain fsa program securitizations 
this caused a postponement of substantially all of the cash otherwise distributable to the company from its fsa program securitizations as this cash was used to fund increased credit enhancement requirements on fsa program securitizations 
additionally  the increase in credit losses resulted in increases in credit enhancement requirements on new securitizations 
faced with constrained cash flows  the company implemented a revised operating plan in february targeted at preserving and strengthening its capital and liquidity position in light of the changed economic environment 
the revised operating plan included a decrease in the company s targeted loan origination volume and a reduction of operating expenses through downsizing its workforce  consolidating its branch office network and closing its canadian lending activities 
loan origination targets were reduced to approximately million per quarter  as compared to actual origination volume of  million in the three months ended december  the quarter prior to implementation of the plan  representing a targeted decrease of approximately 
table of contents in origination volume per quarter 
as a means of achieving reduced origination volume  the company closed of its branch offices  or approximately of its branch office network 
the branch office closings effectively decreased overall loan originations to the new targeted level and reduced operating expenses to a level more commensurate with the new loan origination target 
the revised operating plan did not affect the importance of branch offices to the company s origination model 
that is  the company did not change the branch office origination model  the structure was downsized in order to achieve volume decreases and expense reductions 
on april   the board of directors of the company announced the reorganization of the company s executive management team in order to align management with the revised operating plan 
michael r 
barrington stepped down as president and chief executive officer and michael t 
miller stepped down as chief operating officer 
clifton h 
morris  jr  chairman of the board  assumed the chief executive officer position 
daniel e 
berce was promoted from chief financial officer to president 
preston a 
miller was promoted to chief financial officer and mark floyd was promoted to chief operating officer 
the stated objectives of the plan were substantially met by the end of calendar and the impact of the revised operating plan has been reflected in the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
in the first half of calendar  the company raised its loan origination targets and has added staff to its branch office network in order to support new loan growth 
as a result  loan origination volume reached  million for the three months ended june  the company intends to continue to expand loan origination volume at a moderate pace in fiscal the company restated its financial statements for the year ended june   as a result of a review of the accounting treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas for certain interest rate swap agreements that were entered into prior to and used to hedge interest rate risk on a portion of its cash flows from credit enhancement assets 
at the same time  the company restated its financial statements relating to the implementation of the emerging issues task force issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in secured financial assets eitf 
the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in future excess cash flows attributable to fluctuations in interest rates on floating rate securities issued by its securitization trusts in connection with its securitizations accounted for as sales 
the cash flows are expected to be received over the life of the securitization 
prior to calendar  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements outside of the securitization trusts  at the corporate level 
upon implementation of sfas on july   the swap agreements were valued and recorded separately from the credit enhancement assets on the consolidated balance sheets  with changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements recorded in other comprehensive income 
unrealized losses or gains related to the interest rate swap agreements were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings as accretion was recorded on the hedged cash flows of the credit enhancement assets 
however  as unrealized gains related to the credit enhancement assets declined due to worse than expected credit losses and unrealized losses related to the interest rate swap agreements increased due to a declining interest rate environment  a combined net unrealized loss position developed in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in these situations  the company reclassified amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings based upon the cash flows of the credit enhancement assets utilizing a discount rate which resulted in all of the remaining unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income being reclassified into earnings in the same period when the remaining accretion on the credit enhancement assets was projected to be realized 
a review of this accounting treatment indicated that the company should have reclassified additional accumulated other comprehensive losses into earnings since the combination of the derivative instrument and the hedged item resulted in net unrealized losses that were not expected to be recovered in future periods 
additionally  the company reported payments relating to the interest rate swap agreements as a reduction of unrealized gains on credit enhancement assets within accumulated other 
table of contents comprehensive income 
this treatment resulted in a misclassification of unrealized losses on cash flow hedges within other comprehensive income and an overstatement of servicing income by million million net of tax during the year ended june  in addition  in determining the amount of present value discount to accrete into earnings  the company utilized discount rates that were less than the discount rates used to value the credit enhancement assets 
this treatment reduced the amount of earnings to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings 
the company also compared total undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset in determining whether there was an other than temporary impairment of a credit enhancement asset that should be recorded as a loss in earnings which resulted in unrealized losses on credit enhancement assets remaining in other comprehensive income during the year ended june  a review of these two accounting treatments indicated that under eitf the company should have used the same discount rate used to value the credit enhancement assets to accrete the present value discount into earnings 
additionally  eitf requires that the company compare total discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset in determining whether there was an other than temporary impairment of a credit enhancement asset that should be recorded as a loss in earnings 
the impact of this review was that an additional million of accretion and million of impairment on credit enhancement assets  or a net million million net of tax  of servicing income should have been recorded for the year ended june  accordingly  as disclosed in the june  form k  the company restated its financial statements for the year ended june   to reclassify additional unrealized gains and losses to servicing income from accumulated other comprehensive income for changes in the amount of losses on cash flow hedges  accretion and impairment on credit enhancement assets to be recognized 
it was also determined through the review that periods prior to the year ended june   were not impacted and thus no restatement was required 
in august  the company was contacted by the staff of the enforcement division of the securities and exchange commission sec and informally requested to provide the staff with certain documents and other information related to the restatement 
subsequently  in connection with a registration statement filed by the company with the sec for the company s convertible senior notes  the staff of the division of corporation finance of the sec conducted an extensive review of the disclosures in the company s filings with the sec  including the disclosures related to and the events resulting in the restatement 
following the review by the sec s division of corporation finance  the registration statement was declared effective in july the company cooperated fully with the staff of the sec in these reviews 
at this point  the company does not anticipate any further communication from the sec related to the restatement 

table of contents the restatement resulted in the following changes to the financial statements for the year ended june   all of which were included in the june  form k in thousands  except per share data year ended june  servicing income previous as restated income before income taxes previous as restated net income previous as restated diluted earnings per share previous as restated june  credit enhancement assets previous as restated accumulated other comprehensive income previous as restated shareholders equity previous as restated critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates and those differences may be material 
the accounting estimates that the company believes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following gain on sale of receivables the company periodically transfers receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell asset backed securities to investors 
prior to october   the company recognized a gain on the sale of receivables to the trusts  which represented the difference between the sale proceeds to the company  net of transaction costs  and the company s net carrying value of the receivables  plus the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received by the company over the life of the securitization 
the company has made assumptions in order to determine the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be generated by the pool of receivables sold 
the most significant assumptions made are the cumulative credit losses to be incurred on the pool of receivables sold  the timing of those losses and the rate at which the estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 

table of contents significant assumptions used in determining the gain on sale of auto receivables were as follows years ended june  cumulative credit losses discount rate used to estimate present value interest only receivables from trusts investments in trust receivables restricted cash gain on sale trusts the cumulative credit loss assumptions utilized at the time of sale of receivables were determined using a range of possible outcomes based on historical experience  credit attributes for the specific pool of receivables and general economic factors 
the cumulative credit loss assumption reflects the approximate level that cumulative credit losses could reach notwithstanding other assumptions in a securitization pool before the credit enhancement assets would suffer an other than temporary impairment 
the discount rates used to estimate the present value of credit enhancement assets are based on the relative risks of each asset type 
interest only receivables from trusts represent estimated future excess cash flows in the trusts and have a first loss position to absorb any shortfall in trust cash flows due to adverse credit loss development or adverse changes in trust performance relative to other assumptions 
while the company earns a higher yield on its securitized receivables  the company utilizes a discount rate for interest only receivables from trusts since net undiscounted estimated future excess cash flows already incorporate a default assumption and the receivables underlying the securitization represent a diverse pool of assets 
restricted cash gain on sale trusts and investments in trust receivables represent cash and finance receivables held by the trusts and are senior to interest only receivables from trusts for credit enhancement purposes 
accordingly  restricted cash gain on sale trusts and investments in trust receivables are assigned a lower discount rate than the interest only receivables from trusts 
the assumptions used represent the company s best estimates 
the use of different assumptions would produce different financial results 
credit enhancement assets the company s credit enhancement assets  which represent retained interests in securitization trusts accounted for as sales  are recorded at fair value 
because market prices are not readily available for the credit enhancement assets  fair value is determined using discounted cash flow models 
the most significant assumptions made are the cumulative net credit losses to be incurred on the pool of receivables sold  the timing of those losses and the rate at which estimated future excess cash flows are discounted 
the assumptions used represent the company s best estimates 
the assumptions may change in future periods due to changes in the economy that may impact the performance of the company s finance receivables and the risk profiles of its credit enhancement assets 
the use of different assumptions would result in different carrying values for the company s credit enhancement assets and may change the amount of accretion of present value discount and impairment of credit enhancement assets recognized through the consolidated statements of income 
an immediate and adverse change in the assumptions used to measure the fair value of credit enhancement assets would decrease the credit enhancement assets as of june   as follows in thousands impact on fair value of adverse change adverse change expected cumulative net credit losses discount rate the adverse changes to the key assumptions and estimates are hypothetical 
the change in fair value based on the above variations in assumptions cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a 
table of contents particular assumption on fair value is calculated independently from any change in another assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may contribute to changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
furthermore  due to potential changes in current economic conditions  the estimated fair values as disclosed should not be considered indicative of the future performance of these assets 
the sensitivities do not reflect actions management might take to offset the impact of any adverse change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established systematically based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
the company reviews charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates  estimates of the value of the underlying collateral  economic trends  such as unemployment rates  and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the reporting date 
the company also uses historical charge off experience to determine a loss emergence period  which is defined as the time between when an event  such as delinquency status  giving rise to a probable credit loss occurs with respect to a specific account and when such account is charged off 
this loss emergence period is applied to the forecasted probable credit losses to determine the amount of losses inherent in finance receivables at the reporting date 
assumptions regarding probable credit losses and loss emergence periods are reviewed quarterly and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumption or loss emergence period increase  there could be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which could decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the amount of provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of income 
a and increase in cumulative credit losses over the loss emergence period would increase the allowance for loan losses as of june   as follows in thousands adverse change adverse change impact on allowance for loan losses the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover probable losses inherent in its receivables  however  because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimates 
stock based employee compensation on july   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  prospectively for all awards granted or modified subsequent to june  the fair value of each option granted or modified was estimated using an option pricing model based on the following weighted average assumptions year ended june  expected dividends expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years these assumptions are reviewed each time there is a new grant or modification of a previous grant and may be impacted by actual fluctuation in the company s stock price  movements in market interest rates and option terms 
the use of different assumptions would produce a different fair value for the options granted or modified and would impact the amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income 
the impact of a or increase in the company s assumptions of volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life on the amount of compensation expense recognized would not have been material for the year ended june  
table of contents results of operations year ended june  as compared to year ended june  revenue a summary of changes in the company s finance receivables is as follows in thousands years ended june  balance at beginning of period loans purchased liquidations and other sold to gain on sale securitization trusts balance at end of period average finance receivables the decrease in loans purchased resulted from a reduction in the number of the company s branch offices and a tightening of credit standards in connection with the company s revised operating plan implemented in february as of june   the company operated auto lending branch offices 
during fiscal  the company operated as many as branch offices 
as of june   the company operated branch offices 
the increase in liquidations and other resulted primarily from increased collections and charge offs on finance receivables due to the increase in average finance receivables and average age  or seasoning  of the portfolio 
the average new loan size was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the average annual percentage rate for finance receivables purchased during fiscal was  compared to during fiscal the company s tightening of credit standards in connection with its revised operating plan implemented in february resulted in a lower average annual percentage rate 
finance charge income increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the increase in average finance receivables 
the company s effective yield on its finance receivables decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the effective yield represents finance charges and fees taken into earnings during the period as a percentage of average finance receivables and is lower than the contractual rates of the company s auto finance contracts due to finance receivables in nonaccrual status 
the effective yield decreased primarily due to a decrease in average annual percentage rates for finance receivables outstanding during the period 
subsequent to september   the company s securitization transactions were structured as secured financings 
therefore  no gain on sale was recorded for finance receivables securitized during fiscal the gain on sale of receivables for fiscal was million  or of finance receivables securitized 
servicing income consists of the following in thousands years ended june  servicing fees other than temporary impairment accretion average gain on sale receivables servicing fees are earned from servicing domestic finance receivables sold to gain on sale trusts 
servicing fees decreased as a result of the decrease in average gain on sale receivables caused by the change in the company s securitization transaction structure from gain on sale to secured financing 
servicing fees were and of average gain on sale receivables for fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents other than temporary impairment of million for fiscal resulted from higher than forecasted default rates in certain trusts 
other than temporary impairment of million for fiscal  resulted from increased default rates caused by the continued weakness in the economy and lower than expected recovery proceeds caused by depressed used car values  as well as the expected delay in cash distributions from fsa program securitizations which reduced the present value of such cash distributions 
the present value discount related to the company s credit enhancement assets represents the risk adjusted time value of money on estimated cash flows 
the present value discount on credit enhancement assets is accreted into earnings over the life of credit enhancement assets using the effective interest method 
additionally  unrealized gains on credit enhancement assets reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income are also accreted into earnings over the life of the credit enhancement assets using the effective interest method 
the company recognized accretion of million  or  of average gain on sale receivables  during fiscal accretion of million  or  of average gain on sale receivables  was recognized during fiscal the increase in accretion as a percentage of average gain on sale receivables resulted from fewer securitization transactions incurring other than temporary impairments during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as the company does not record accretion in a period when such accretion would cause an other than temporary impairment in a securitization pool 
other income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in other income is primarily due to an increase in late fees and other fees associated with higher average finance receivables 
costs and expenses operating expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating expenses declined primarily as a result of a reduction in workforce in november  the implementation of a revised operating plan in february and the closing of the company s jacksonville collections center in april the company recognized million and million in restructuring charges for fiscal and  respectively 
the restructuring charges for fiscal consisted primarily of facility costs related to the closing of the company s jacksonville collections center  the elimination of excess space at its chandler collections center and corporate headquarters  as well as adjustments to the restructuring charges related to the company s implementation of a revised operating plan in february the restructuring charges for fiscal included million for the company s november reduction in workforce and million related to the implementation of the february revised operating plan 
provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the company s allowance for loan losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables 
the provision for loan losses recorded for the fiscal year reflects inherent losses on receivables originated during that year and changes in the amount of inherent losses on receivables originated in prior years 
the provision for loan losses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of average finance receivables  the provision for loan losses was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average finance receivables was higher for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the company s transition to structuring securitization transactions as secured financings 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to higher debt levels 
average debt outstanding was  million and  million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s effective rate of interest paid on its debt decreased to from as a result of lower short term interest rates 
the increase in average debt outstanding resulted from the company s decision to structure securitization transactions subsequent to september   as secured financings 

table of contents the company s effective income tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from lower canadian tax rates combined with the impact of a change in the mix of business among states  resulting in a lower state tax rate 
other comprehensive income loss other comprehensive income loss consisted of the following in thousands years ended june  unrealized gains losses on credit enhancement assets unrealized gains on cash flow hedges canadian currency translation adjustment income tax provision benefit credit enhancement assets unrealized gains losses on credit enhancement assets consisted of the following in thousands years ended june  unrealized gains at time of sale unrealized gains losses related to changes in credit loss assumptions unrealized gains losses related to changes in interest rates reclassification of unrealized gains into earnings through accretion changes in the fair value of credit enhancement assets as a result of modifications to the credit loss assumptions are reported as unrealized gains in other comprehensive income loss until realized 
unrealized losses are reported as a reduction in unrealized gains to the extent that there are unrealized gains 
if there are no unrealized gains to offset the unrealized losses  the losses are considered to be other than temporary and are charged to operations 
the cumulative credit loss assumptions used to estimate the fair value of credit enhancement assets are periodically reviewed by the company and modified to reflect the actual credit performance for each securitization pool through the reporting date as well as estimates of future losses considering several factors including changes in the general economy 
differences between cumulative credit loss assumptions used in individual securitization pools can be attributed to the original credit attributes of a pool  actual credit performance through the reporting date and pool seasoning to the extent that changes in economic trends will have more of an impact on the expected future performance of less seasoned pools 
the company increased the cumulative credit loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets to a range of to as of june   from a range of to as of june  on a trust by trust basis  certain trusts experienced worse than expected credit performance for fiscal  and increased cumulative credit loss assumptions resulting in other than temporary impairment 
certain other trusts experienced better than expected credit performance for fiscal  resulting in decreased cumulative credit loss assumptions resulting in unrealized gains of million for those securitization trusts 
unrealized losses of million for fiscal resulted from an increase in the cumulative credit loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets to a range of to as of june   from a range of to as of june  unrealized gains related to changes in interest rates of million for fiscal resulted primarily from an increase in estimated future cash flows to be generated from investment income earned on the restricted cash and trust collection accounts due to an increase in forward interest rate expectations 
unrealized losses related to 
table of contents changes in interest rates of million for fiscal resulted primarily from a decline in estimated future cash flows to be generated from investment income earned on the restricted cash and trust collections accounts due to lower interest rates 
the lower earnings were partially offset by an increase in value associated with a decrease in interest rates payable to investors on the floating rate tranches of securitization transactions 
net unrealized gains of million and million were reclassified into earnings through accretion during fiscal and  respectively  and relate primarily to recognition of actual excess cash collected over the company s initial estimate and recognition of unrealized gains at time of sale 
included in the net unrealized gains reclassified into earnings during fiscal and  are net unrealized gains of million and million  respectively  related to fluctuations in interest rates during the periods which are offset by changes in some of the cash flow hedges described below 
cash flow hedges unrealized gains on cash flow hedges were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
unrealized gains of million for fiscal were primarily due to the change in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges caused by an increase in forward interest rate expectations and declining notional balances 
unrealized losses of million for fiscal were primarily due to the change in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges caused by a decrease in forward interest rate expectations 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of the company s credit enhancement assets are reclassified into earnings when unrealized gains or losses related to interest rate fluctuations on the company s credit enhancement assets are reclassified 
however  if the company expects that the continued reporting of a loss in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the interest rate swap agreements and the credit enhancement assets  the loss is reclassified to earnings for the amount that is not expected to be recovered 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of the company s floating rate debt are reclassified into earnings when interest rate fluctuations on securitization notes payable affect earnings 
net unrealized losses reclassified into earnings were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
canadian currency translation adjustment canadian currency translation adjustment gains of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  were included in other comprehensive income loss 
the translation adjustment gain is due to the increase in the value of the company s canadian dollar denominated assets related to the decline in the us dollar to canadian dollar conversion rates during the years 
the company does not anticipate the settlement of intercompany transactions with its canadian subsidiaries in the foreseeable future 
net margin net margin is the difference between finance charge and other income earned on the company s receivables and the cost to fund the receivables as well as the cost of debt incurred for general corporate purposes 
the company s net margin as reflected on the consolidated statements of income is as follows in thousands years ended june  finance charge income other income interest expense net margin 
table of contents the company evaluates the profitability of its lending activities based partly upon the net margin related to its managed auto loan portfolio  including finance receivables and gain on sale receivables 
the company uses this information to analyze trends in the components of the profitability of its managed auto portfolio 
analysis of net margin on a managed basis allows the company to determine which origination channels and loan products are most profitable  guides the company in making pricing decisions for loan products and indicates if sufficient spread exists between the company s revenues and cost of funds to cover operating expenses and achieve corporate profitability objectives 
additionally  net margin on a managed basis facilitates comparisons of results between the company and other finance companies i that do not securitize their receivables or ii due to the structure of their securitization transactions  are not required to account for the securitization of their receivables as a sale 
the company routinely securitizes its receivables and prior to october   recorded a gain on the sale of such receivables 
the net margin on a managed basis presented below assumes that all securitized receivables have not been sold and are still on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  no gain on sale or servicing income would have been recognized 
instead  finance charges would be recognized over the life of the securitized receivables as earned  and interest and other costs related to the asset backed securities would be recognized as incurred

prior to october   the company sold substantially all of its finance receivables to securitization trusts shortly after the origination date 

table of contents the average new loan size was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase in average new loan size was due to a change in the mix of business towards financing later model vehicles 
the average annual percentage rate for finance receivables purchased during fiscal was  compared to during fiscal decreasing short term market interest rates have lowered the company s cost of funds  allowing the company to pass along some of this benefit to consumers in the form of lower loan pricing 
finance charge income increased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal finance charge income was higher due to an increase in average finance receivables that resulted primarily from the company s decision to structure securitization transactions as secured financings 
the company s effective yield on its finance receivables decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the effective yield represents finance charges and fees taken into earnings during the period as a percentage of average finance receivables and differs from the contractual rates of the company s auto finance contracts due to finance receivables in nonaccrual status and  for fiscal  finance charges earned between the origination date and funding date 
the effective yield decreased for fiscal due to lower levels of finance charges earned between the origination date and funding date as well as lower loan pricing 
the gain on sale of receivables decreased by to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in gain on sale of receivables resulted from the company s decision to structure securitization transactions subsequent to september   to no longer meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables 
during fiscal   million of finance receivables securitized were accounted for as sales of receivables as compared to  million during fiscal the gain as a percentage of the finance receivables securitized in gain on sale trusts remained relatively stable at for fiscal as compared to for fiscal servicing income consists of the following in thousands years ended june  servicing fees other than temporary impairment accretion average gain on sale receivables servicing fees are earned from servicing domestic finance receivables sold to gain on sale trusts 
servicing fees increased as a result of an increase in average gain on sale receivables 
servicing fees were and  of average gain on sale receivables for fiscal and  respectively 
the company recorded other than temporary impairments of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
other than temporary impairment resulted from increased default rates caused by continued weakness in the economy and lower than expected recovery proceeds caused by depressed used car values 
in addition  the company s credit enhancement assets are carried on its financial statements based on the present value of future excess cash flows to be received by the company from securitization trusts 
in fiscal  the expected delay in cash distributions from the fsa program securitizations due to breaches of certain portfolio performance ratios and  to a lesser extent  additional insurance fees payable to fsa in connection with an amendment to the event of default net loss ratios reduced the present value of such cash distributions and resulted in other than temporary impairment 
the present value discount related to the company s credit enhancement assets represents the risk adjusted time value of money on estimated cash flows

table of contents accreted into earnings over the life of the credit enhancement assets using the effective interest method 
the company recognized accretion of million  or  of average gain on sale receivables  during fiscal accretion of million  or  of average gain on sale receivables  was recognized during fiscal the decrease in accretion as a percentage of average gain on sale receivables resulted from more securitization transactions incurring other than temporary impairments during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as the company does not record accretion in a period when such accretion would cause an other than temporary impairment in a securitization pool 
other income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in other income is primarily due to investment income earned on higher average cash and restricted cash balances and an increase in late fees and other fees associated with higher average finance receivables 
costs and expenses operating expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating expenses declined primarily as a result of a reduction in workforce in november and implementation of a revised operating plan in february the company recognized million in restructuring charges including million for its november reduction in workforce and million related to the implementation of a revised operating plan in february the revised operating plan included a decrease in the company s targeted loan origination volume to approximately million per quarter and a reduction of operating expenses 
the restructuring charges consisted primarily of severance costs of identified workforce reductions of approximately  positions related to the consolidation closing of branch offices including the closing of the company s canadian lending activities  costs incurred to terminate facility and equipment leases prior to their expiration date as well as estimated costs that will continue to be incurred under the contracts for their remaining terms without economic benefit to the company 
the restructuring charges also include million of previously capitalized costs for discontinuation of the development of the company s customer relationship management system  which was designed to provide operational scalability and marketing benefits in a high growth environment 
provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the company s allowance for loan losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables 
the provision for loan losses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of average finance receivables  the provision for loan losses was and for fiscal and  respectively 
subsequent to september   the company changed the structure of its securitization transactions to no longer meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables 
under this new structure  finance receivables remain on the company s balance sheet throughout their term  and credit losses related to those securitized receivables are provided for as a charge to operations 
the remaining increase reflects the general expectation that current economic conditions  including elevated unemployment rates  will result in a higher number of charge offs  and that depressed wholesale auction prices on the sale of repossessed vehicles will result in a higher amount charged off per loan 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due to higher debt levels 
average debt outstanding was  million and  million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company s effective rate of interest paid on its debt decreased to from as a result of lower short term market interest rates 
the increase in average debt outstanding resulted from the company s decision to structure securitization transactions subsequent to september   as secured financings

table of contents other comprehensive loss other comprehensive loss consisted of the following in thousands years ended june  unrealized losses on credit enhancement assets unrealized gains on cash flow hedges canadian currency translation adjustment income tax benefit credit enhancement assets unrealized losses on credit enhancement assets consisted of the following in thousands years ended june  unrealized gains at time of sale unrealized losses gains related to changes in credit loss assumptions unrealized losses related to changes in interest rates reclassification of unrealized gains into earnings through accretion the unrealized gains at time of sale represent the excess of the fair value of credit enhancement assets over the company s allocated carrying value related to such interests when receivables are sold 
unrealized gains at time of sale were lower for fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the change in the structure of securitization transactions entered into subsequent to september   to no longer meet the criteria for sales of finance receivables 
changes in the fair value of credit enhancement assets as a result of modifications to the credit loss assumptions are reported as unrealized gains in other comprehensive loss until realized 
unrealized losses are reported as a reduction in unrealized gains to the extent that there are unrealized gains 
if there are no unrealized gains to offset the unrealized losses  the losses are considered to be other than temporary and are charged to operations 
the cumulative credit loss assumptions used to estimate the fair value of credit enhancement assets are periodically reviewed by the company and modified to reflect the actual credit performance for each securitization pool through the reporting date as well as estimates of future losses considering several factors including changes in the general economy 
differences between cumulative credit loss assumptions used in individual securitization pools can be attributed to the original credit attributes of a pool  actual credit performance through the reporting date and pool seasoning to the extent that changes in economic trends will have more of an impact on the expected future performance of less seasoned pools 
the company increased the cumulative credit loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets to a range of to as of june   from a range of to as of june   which  together with the expected delay in cash distributions from the fsa program  caused an other than temporary impairment charge of million and unrealized losses of million for fiscal the range of cumulative credit loss assumptions was increased to reflect adverse actual credit performance compared to previous assumptions as well as expectations for higher future losses due to continued weakness in the general economy 
unrealized gains of million for fiscal resulted from the decline in the carrying value of credit enhancement assets caused by the reclassification of unrealized gains and losses between credit enhancement assets and cash flow hedges 
this was partially offset by an increase in the range of cumulative credit loss assumptions for securitization trusts to reflect adverse actual credit performance compared to previous assumptions as well as expectations for higher future losses due to economic weakness 
cumulative credit loss assumptions used in measuring the fair value of credit enhancement assets ranged from to as of june   as compared to to as of june  
table of contents unrealized losses related to changes in interest rates of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  resulted primarily from a decline in estimated future cash flows to be generated from investment income earned on the restricted cash and trust collections accounts due to lower interest rates 
the lower earnings were partially offset by an increase in value associated with a decrease in interest rates payable to investors on the floating rate tranches of securitization transactions 
net unrealized gains of million and million were reclassified into earnings through accretion during fiscal and  respectively  and relate primarily to recognition of actual excess cash collected over the company s initial estimate and recognition of unrealized gains at time of sale 
included in the net unrealized gains reclassified into earnings during fiscal and are net unrealized gains of million and million  respectively  related to fluctuations in interest rates during the respective periods which are offset by some of the cash flow hedges described below 
cash flow hedges unrealized gains on cash flow hedges were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
unrealized losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  were primarily due to the change in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges caused by a decrease in forward interest rate expectations 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of the company s credit enhancement assets are reclassified into earnings when unrealized gains or losses related to interest rate fluctuations on the company s credit enhancement assets are reclassified 
however  if the company expects that the continued reporting of a loss in accumulated other comprehensive income would lead to recognizing a net loss on the combination of the interest rate swap agreements and the credit enhancement assets  the loss is reclassified to earnings for the amount that is not expected to be recovered 
unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges of the company s floating rate debt are reclassified into earnings when interest rate fluctuations on securitization notes payable affect earnings 
net unrealized losses reclassified into earnings were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
canadian currency translation adjustment canadian currency translation adjustment gains of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  were included in other comprehensive loss 
the translation adjustment gain is due to the increase in the value of the company s canadian dollar denominated assets related to the decline in the us dollar to canadian dollar conversion rates during the years 
the company does not anticipate the settlement of intercompany transactions with its canadian subsidiaries in the foreseeable future 
net margin net margin is the difference between finance charge and other income earned on the company s receivables and the cost to fund the receivables as well as the cost of debt incurred for general corporate purposes 
the company s net margin as reflected on the consolidated statements of income is as follows in thousands years ended june  finance charge income other income interest expense net margin the company evaluates the profitability of its lending activities based partly upon the net margin related to its managed auto loan portfolio  including finance receivables and gain on sale receivables 
the company uses this information to analyze trends in the components of the profitability of its managed auto portfolio 
analysis of net margin on a managed basis allows the company to determine which origination channels and loan 
table of contents products are most profitable  guides the company in making pricing decisions for loan products and indicates if sufficient spread exists between the company s revenues and cost of funds to cover operating expenses and achieve corporate profitability objectives 
additionally  net margin on a managed basis facilitates comparisons of results between the company and other finance companies i that do not securitize their receivables or ii due to the structure of their securitization transactions  are not required to account for the securitization of their receivables as a sale 
the company routinely securitizes its receivables and prior to october   recorded a gain on the sale of such receivables 
the net margin on a managed basis presented below assumes that all securitized receivables have not been sold and are still on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
accordingly  no gain on sale or servicing income would have been recognized 
instead  finance charges would be recognized over the life of the securitized receivables as earned  and interest and other costs related to the asset backed securities would be recognized as incurred 
average managed receivables consists of finance receivables held by the company and finance receivables sold to the company s securitization trusts in transactions accounted for as sales

finance receivables on the company s balance sheets include receivables purchased but not yet securitized and receivables securitized by the company after september  provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses on the balance sheet at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables 
historically  finance receivables were charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the company repossessed and disposed of the automobile or the account was otherwise deemed uncollectable 
during the three months ended december   the company changed its charge off policy to charge off repossessed accounts when the automobile has been repossessed and is legally available for disposition 
prior to october   the company periodically sold receivables to trusts in securitization transactions accounted for as a sale of receivables and retained an interest in the receivables sold in the form of credit enhancement assets 
credit enhancement assets are reflected on the company s balance sheet at fair value  calculated based upon the present value of estimated excess future cash flows from the trusts using  among other assumptions  estimates of future credit losses on the receivables sold 
charge offs of receivables that have been sold to trusts decrease the amount of excess future cash flows from the trusts 
if such charge offs are expected to exceed the company s original estimates of cumulative credit losses or if the actual timing of these losses differs from expected timing  the fair value of credit enhancement assets is written down through an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings to the extent the write down exceeds any unrealized gain

delinquencies in the company s managed receivables portfolio may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio  seasonality within the calendar year and economic factors 
due to the company s target customer base  a relatively high percentage of accounts become delinquent at some point in the life of a loan and there is a high rate of account movement between current and delinquent status in the portfolio 
total managed finance receivables to days and greater than days delinquent were lower as of june   compared to june   due to the company s implementation of more aggressive repossession and liquidation strategies on late stage delinquent accounts in early calendar as well as improved credit performance on loans originated since implementation of the revised operating plan in february the decline in the level of accounts in repossession is due to the company s change in its repossession charge off policy to charge off accounts when the automobile is repossessed and legally available for disposition rather than when it is repossessed and disposed of 
delinquencies in finance receivables are lower than delinquencies in gain on sale receivables due to the relative lower overall seasoning of such finance receivables as well as improved credit performance on loans originated since implementation of the revised operating plan in february deferrals in accordance with its policies and guidelines  the company  at times  offers payment deferrals to consumers  whereby the consumer is allowed to move up to two delinquent payments to the end of the loan generally by paying a fee approximately the interest portion of the payment deferred 
the company s policies and guidelines  as well as certain contractual restrictions in the company s warehouse credit facilities and securitization transactions  limit the number and frequency of deferments that may be granted 
the company s policies and guidelines generally limit the granting of deferments on new accounts until a requisite number of 
table of contents payments have been received 
due to the nature of the company s customer base and policies and guidelines of the deferral program  approximately of the company s customers receive a deferral at some point in the life of their loan 
an account for which all delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account 
thereafter  such account is aged based on the timely payment of future installments in the same manner as any other account 
contracts receiving a payment deferral as an average quarterly percentage of average managed receivables outstanding were as follows years ended june  finance receivables gain on sale receivables the percentage of contracts receiving a payment deferral decreased during fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to the decline in delinquent receivables 
the percentage of contracts receiving a payment deferral increased during fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to the company providing deferments to a higher number of consumers who were temporarily unable to make monthly payments as originally contracted due to weak economic conditions 
the following is a summary of total deferrals as a percentage of managed receivables outstanding june  finance receivables gain on sale total managed never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total june  finance receivables gain on sale total managed never deferred deferred times times greater than times total deferred total the company evaluates the results of its deferment strategies based upon the amount of cash installments that are collected on accounts after they have been deferred versus the extent to which the collateral underlying deferred accounts has depreciated over the same period of time 
based on this evaluation  the company believes that payment deferrals granted according to its policies and guidelines are an effective portfolio management technique and result in higher ultimate cash collections from the portfolio 

table of contents changes in deferment levels do not have a direct impact on the ultimate amount of finance receivables charged off by the company 
however  timing of charge offs may be affected if the previously deferred account ultimately results in a charge off 
to the extent that deferrals impact the ultimate timing of when an account is charged off  historical charge off ratios and loss emergence periods used in the determination of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses are also impacted 
increased use of deferrals may result in a lengthening of the loss emergence period  which would increase expectations of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and therefore increase the allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses 
changes in these ratios and periods are considered in determining the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses and related provision for loan losses

net charge offs as a percentage of average managed receivables outstanding may vary from period to period based upon the average age or seasoning of the portfolio and economic factors 
the increase in net charge offs for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from the company s change in repossession charge off policy during the quarter ended december   and weakness in the economy during the first half of fiscal in implementing the new repossession charge off policy  the company incurred additional charge offs of million related to the acceleration of charge off timing for certain accounts already repossessed 
the increase in net charge offs for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from continued weakness in the economy  including higher unemployment rates  as well as lower net recoveries on repossessed vehicles 
recoveries as a percentage of repossession charge offs decreased due to the general declines in used car auction values 
in addition  the company implemented a more aggressive strategy for repossessing and liquidating late stage delinquent accounts in early calendar resulting in a higher level of net charge offs for fiscal

whole loan purchase facility in march  the company entered into a whole loan purchase facility with an original term of approximately four years under which the company transferred billion of finance receivables to a special purpose finance subsidiary of the company and received an advance of million from the purchaser 
additionally  the company issued a million note to the purchaser representing debt issuance costs in the form of a residual interest in the finance receivables transferred 
in september  the company terminated the whole loan purchase facility

prior to october   the company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the company changed the structure of securitization transactions completed subsequent to september   to no longer meet the accounting criteria for sale of finance receivables 
this change in securitization structure does not change the company s requirement to provide credit enhancement in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the company typically makes an initial deposit to a restricted cash account and transfers finance receivables in excess of the amount of asset backed securities 
table of contents issued to create initial overcollateralization 
the company subsequently uses excess cash flows generated by the trusts to either increase the restricted cash account or repay the outstanding asset backed securities on an accelerated basis  thereby creating additional credit enhancement through overcollateralization in the trusts 
when the credit enhancement levels reach specified percentages of the trust s pool of receivables  excess cash flows are distributed to the company 
the company employs two types of securitization structures to meet its credit enhancement requirements 
the structure the company has utilized most frequently involves the purchase of a financial guaranty policy issued by an insurer to cover the asset backed securities as well as the use of reinsurance and other alternative credit enhancement products to reduce the required initial deposit to the restricted cash account and initial overcollateralization 
however  the company currently has no material outstanding commitments to obtain reinsurance or other alternative credit enhancement products and will likely be required to provide initial credit enhancement deposits in future securitization transactions from its existing capital resources 
the company s second type of securitization structure involves the sale of subordinated asset backed securities in order to provide credit enhancement for the senior asset backed securities 
the subordinated asset backed securities replace a portion of the company s credit enhancement required in a securitization transaction in a manner similar to the utilization of insurance or other alternative credit enhancements described in the preceding paragraph 
the initial cash deposit and overcollateralization transfer as well as the targeted levels of credit enhancement required in the company s securitization transactions completed since january   were higher than the levels required in the company s prior securitization transactions 
initial cash deposit and overcollateralization levels were raised to approximately from of the original receivable pool balance and target credit enhancement levels now must reach approximately compared to the previous requirement of of the receivable pool balance before cash is distributed to the company 
under this structure  the company expects to begin to receive cash distributions approximately five to eight months after receivables are securitized 
the company believes that additional securitizations to be completed in fiscal will require initial cash and overcollateralization levels and target credit enhancement levels similar to securitization transactions completed in fiscal cash flows related to securitization transactions were as follows in millions years ended june  initial credit enhancement deposits gain on sale trusts restricted cash overcollateralization borrowings under credit enhancement facility secured financing trusts restricted cash overcollateralization distributions from trusts  net of swap payments gain on sale trusts secured financing trusts with respect to the company s securitization transactions covered by a financial guaranty insurance policy  agreements with the insurers provide that if portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default or cumulative net loss triggers in a trust s pool of receivables exceed certain targets  the specified credit enhancement levels would be increased 
prior to october  the financial guaranty insurance policies for all of the company s insured securitization transactions were provided by fsa 
the restricted cash account for each securitization trust 
table of contents insured as part of the fsa program is cross collateralized to the restricted cash accounts established in connection with the company s other securitization trusts in the fsa program  such that excess cash flows from an fsa program securitization that has already met its own credit enhancement requirement may be used to fund increased credit enhancement requirements with respect to fsa program securitization in which specified portfolio performance ratios have been exceeded  rather than being distributed to the company 
the company s securitization transactions insured by financial guaranty insurance providers  including fsa  since october are cross collateralized to a more limited extent 
in the event of a shortfall in the original target credit enhancement requirement for any of these securitization trusts after a certain period of time  excess cash flows from other transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be used to satisfy the shortfall amount 
in one of the company s securitization transactions  if a secured party receives a notice of a rating agency review for downgrade or if there is a downgrade of any class of notes without taking into consideration the presence of the financial guaranty insurance policy excess cash flows from other securitization transactions insured by the same insurance provider would be utilized to satisfy any increased target credit enhancement requirements 
as of june   the company had exceeded its targeted cumulative net loss triggers in seven of the eleven remaining fsa program securitization trusts and waivers were not granted by fsa 
accordingly  cash generated by fsa program securitization trusts otherwise distributable to the company was used to fund increased credit enhancement levels for the fsa program securitizations that breached their cumulative net loss triggers 
the higher targeted credit enhancement levels have been reached and maintained in all of the fsa program securitizations that had breached targeted cumulative net loss triggers as of june  the increase in required credit enhancement levels caused by breach of cumulative net loss triggers on the fsa program trusts resulted in an additional million in restricted cash being held by these trusts as of june  the targeted cumulative net loss triggers are expected to be breached on the remaining fsa program securitization trusts during fiscal the company does not expect waivers to be granted by fsa in the future with respect to securitizations that breach portfolio performance triggers and estimates that cash otherwise distributable to the company on fsa program securitization transactions will be used to fund increased credit enhancement for remaining fsa program transactions  delaying and reducing the amount to be released to the company during fiscal the agreements that the company enters into with its financial guaranty insurance providers in connection with securitization transactions contain additional specified targeted portfolio performance ratios delinquency  cumulative default and cumulative net loss triggers that are higher than the limits referred to above 
if  at any measurement date  the targeted portfolio performance ratios with respect to any insured trust were to exceed these additional levels  provisions of the agreements permit the financial guaranty insurance providers to terminate the company s servicing rights to the receivables sold to that trust 
in addition  the servicing agreements on certain insured securitization trusts are cross defaulted so that a default under one servicing agreement would allow the financial guaranty insurance provider to terminate the company s servicing rights under all servicing agreements for securitization trusts in which they issued a financial guaranty insurance policy 
additionally  if these higher targeted portfolio performance levels were exceeded  the financial guaranty insurance providers may elect to retain all excess cash generated by other securitization transactions insured by them as additional credit enhancement 
this  in turn  could result in defaults under the company s other securitizations and other material indebtedness 
although the company has never exceeded these additional targeted portfolio performance ratios  and does not anticipate violating any event of default triggers for its securitizations  there can be no assurance that the company s servicing rights with respect to the automobile receivables in such trusts or any other trusts will not be terminated if i such targeted portfolio performance ratios are breached  ii the company breaches its obligations under the servicing agreements  iii the financial guaranty insurance providers are required to make payments under a policy  or iv certain bankruptcy or insolvency events were to occur 
as of june   no such termination events have occurred with respect to any of the trusts formed by the company 
on april   the company announced the approval of a stock repurchase plan by its board of directors 
the stock repurchase plan authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its common 
table of contents stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  based on market conditions 
in accordance with this plan  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter of fiscal subsequent to june   the company repurchased an additional  shares of its common stock  completing this repurchase plan 
on august   the company announced the approval of another stock repurchase plan by its board of directors 
the stock repurchase plan authorizes the company to repurchase up to million of its common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  based on market conditions 
no shares have been repurchased under this plan 
operating plan in february  the company implemented a revised operating plan in order to preserve and strengthen its capital and liquidity position 
the plan included a decrease in targeted loan origination volume to approximately million per quarter and a reduction of operating expenses through downsizing its workforce  consolidating its branch office network and closing the canadian lending activities 
the stated objectives of the revised operating plan were substantially met by the end of calendar in the first half of calendar  the company raised its loan origination targets and has added staff to its branch office network in order to support loan growth 
as a result  loan origination volume reached  million for the fourth quarter of fiscal the company intends to continue to expand loan origination volume at a moderate pace in fiscal the company believes that it has sufficient liquidity to achieve its expansion strategies in fiscal as of june   the company had unrestricted cash balances of million 
assuming that origination volume ranges from billion to billion in fiscal and the initial credit enhancement requirement for the company s securitization transactions remains at  the company would require million to million in cash or liquidity to fund initial credit enhancement in fiscal the company expects that cash distributions from its securitization transactions will exceed the funding requirement for initial credit enhancement deposits for fiscal the company will continue to require the execution of additional securitization transactions in fiscal there can be no assurance that funding will be available to the company through the execution of securitization transactions or  if available  that the funding will be on acceptable terms 
if the company is unable to execute securitization transactions on a regular basis  and was otherwise unable to issue any other debt or equity  it would not have sufficient funds to finance new loan originations and  in such event  the company would be required to revise the scale of its business  including possible discontinuation of loan origination activities  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to achieve its business and financial objectives 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to october   the company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
under this structure  notes issued by the company s unconsolidated qualified special purpose finance subsidiaries are not recorded as liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
see liquidity and capital resources securitization for a detailed discussion of the company s securitization transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fluctuations in market interest rates impact the company s warehouse credit facilities and securitization transactions 
the company s gross interest rate spread  which is the difference between interest earned on its finance receivables and interest paid  is affected by changes in interest rates as a result of the company s dependence upon the issuance of variable rate securities and the incurrence of variable rate debt to fund its purchases of finance receivables 
warehouse credit facilities finance receivables purchased by the company and pledged to secure borrowings under its warehouse credit facilities bear fixed interest rates 
amounts borrowed under the company s warehouse credit facilities bear 
table of contents interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
to protect the interest rate spread within each warehouse credit facility  the company s special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to purchase interest rate cap agreements in connection with borrowings under the company s warehouse credit facilities 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement pays a premium in return for the right to receive the difference in the interest cost at any time a specified index of market interest rates rises above the stipulated cap rate 
the purchaser of the interest rate cap agreement bears no obligation or liability if interest rates fall below the cap rate 
as part of the company s interest rate risk management strategy and when economically feasible  the company may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement in order to offset the premium paid by its special purpose finance subsidiary to purchase the interest rate cap agreement and thus retain the interest rate risk 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiary is included in other assets and the fair value of the interest rate cap agreement sold by the company is included in derivative financial instruments on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
securitizations the interest rate demanded by investors in the company s securitization transactions depends on prevailing market interest rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
the company utilizes several strategies to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its gross interest rate margin  including the use of derivative financial instruments  the regular sale or pledging of auto receivables to securitization trusts and pre funding of securitization transactions 
in its securitization transactions  the company transfers fixed rate finance receivables to trusts that  in turn  sell either fixed rate or floating rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to market interest rate swap spreads for transactions of similar duration or various london interbank offered rates libor and do not fluctuate during the term of the securitization 
the floating rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to libor and fluctuate periodically based on movements in libor 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap and cap agreements  are used to manage the gross interest rate spread on these transactions 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable rate exposures on securities issued by its securitization trusts to a fixed rate  thereby i locking in the gross interest rate spread to be earned by the company over the life of a securitization accounted for as a secured financing that would have been affected by changes in interest rates or ii hedging the variability in future excess cash flows to be received by the company from its credit enhancement assets over the life of a securitization accounted for as a sale that would have been attributable to interest rate risk 
interest rate swap agreements purchased by the company do not impact the amount of cash flows to be received by holders of the asset backed securities issued by the trusts 
the interest rate swap agreements serve to offset the impact of increased or decreased interest paid by the trusts on floating rate asset backed securities on the cash flows to be received by the company from the trusts 
the company utilizes such arrangements to modify its net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on the company s risk tolerance 
in circumstances where the interest rate risk is deemed to be tolerable  usually if the risk is less than one year in term at inception  the company may choose not to hedge potential fluctuations in cash flows due to changes in interest rates 
the company s special purpose finance subsidiaries are contractually required to provide additional credit enhancement on their floating rate securities even if the company chooses not to hedge its future cash flows 
to comply with this requirement  the special purpose finance subsidiary purchases an interest rate cap agreement 
although the interest rate cap agreements are purchased by the trusts  cash outflows from the trusts ultimately impact the company s retained interests in the securitization transactions as cash expended by the securitization trusts will decrease the ultimate amount of cash to be received by the company 
therefore  when economically feasible  the company may simultaneously sell a corresponding interest rate cap agreement to offset the premium paid by the trust to purchase the interest rate cap agreement 
the intrinsic value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the non consolidated special purpose finance subsidiaries is considered in the valuation of the credit enhancement assets 
the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements purchased by the special purpose finance subsidiaries in connection with securitization transactions structured as secured financings are included in other assets and the 
table of contents fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by the company are included in derivative financial instruments on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate cap agreements sold by the company are reflected in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of income 
pre funding securitizations is the practice of issuing more asset backed securities than needed to cover finance receivables initially sold or pledged to the trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until additional receivables are delivered to the trust in amounts up to the pre funded balance held in the escrow account 
the use of pre funded securitizations allows the company to lock in borrowing costs with respect to the finance receivables subsequently delivered to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations during the period between the initial securitization and the subsequent delivery of finance receivables equal to the difference between the interest earned on the proceeds held in the escrow account and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding

notional amounts on interest rate swap and cap agreements are based on contractual terms 
warehouse credit facilities  whole loan purchase facility  securitization notes payable  senior notes and convertible senior notes principal amounts have been classified based on expected payoff 
the notional amounts of interest rate swap and cap agreements  which are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contracts  represent average amounts that will be outstanding for each of the years included in the table 
notional amounts do not represent amounts exchanged by parties and  thus  are not a measure of the company s exposure to loss through its use of these agreements 
management monitors the company s hedging activities to ensure that the value of derivative financial instruments  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s strategies will be effective in minimizing interest rate risk or that increases in interest rates will not have an adverse effect on the company s profitability 
all transactions are entered into for purposes other than trading 

table of contents current accounting pronouncements statement of position in december  the accounting standards executive committee issued statement of position  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop 
sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans or debt securities loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
sop clarified that credit related discounts only apply when there is a deterioration in credit quality between the time the loan is originated and when it is acquired 
the company s loans are acquired shortly after origination and there is no credit deterioration during the time between origination of loans and purchase of loans by the company 
accordingly  once sop is adopted  the company s dealer acquisition fees  classified as nonaccretable acquisition fees prior to july   will no longer be considered credit related and will be accreted into earnings as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
sop is effective for loans acquired in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is encouraged and restatement of previously issued financial statements is prohibited 
the company adopted sop beginning with loans purchased subsequent to june  the adoption of sop will increase the provision for loan losses  thereby reducing earnings in the short term 
this impact will be offset over time by an increase in finance charge income on loans purchased after june   as acquisition fees are amortized to income 
the implementation of this guidance is expected to lower fiscal earnings by approximately million  or per share 
emerging issues task force issue no 
on july   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a tentative conclusion on eitf issue no 
 the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share eitf  to change the existing accounting for convertible debt within the dilutive earnings per share calculation 
this change would result in the company s convertible senior notes  as currently structured  being treated as convertible securities and included in dilutive earnings per share calculations using the if converted method 
this issue is expected to be discussed at the eitf s september meeting  which could ultimately result in the financial accounting standards board fasb either amending the current accounting guidance in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 earnings per share  sfas or issuing a fasb staff bulletin to clarify sfas for the specific situations when accounting for contingently issuable shares applies 
if enacted as currently proposed  eitf would require retroactive restatement of diluted earnings per share  which could result in a decrease in the company s previously reported diluted earnings per share of approximately for fiscal net income for fiscal would not be affected
