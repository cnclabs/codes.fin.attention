item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the purpose of this overview is to provide context for the discussion and analysis of our financial statements that follows by briefly summarizing the most important known trends and uncertainties  as well as the key performance indicators  on which our executives are primarily focused for both the short and long term 
we design  develop  and market field programmable gate arrays fpgas and supporting products and services 
fpgas are integrated circuits ics that adapt the processing and memory capabilities of electronic systems to specific applications 
fpgas are used by designers of communications  computer  consumer  industrial  military and aerospace  and other electronic systems to differentiate their products and get them to market faster 
we are the leading supplier of fpgas based on flash and antifuse technologies 
o semiconductors according to the semiconductor industry association sia  worldwide sales of semiconductors rose to billion in  up from billion in however  the industry reached its peak of billion in before falling to billion in thus  the semiconductor industry which has always been cyclical appears to have resumed a pattern of growth after a setback of historic proportions 
it is possible  though  that the industry has matured to the point where it will no longer be able to achieve the long term growth rates it has experienced in the past 
o logic according to sia  worldwide sales of digital logic ics were billion in  of which application specific ics asics accounted for billion 
asics include conventional gate arrays  standard cells  and programmable logic devices plds 
as they have gotten faster and cheaper over the last decade  plds have gained a sizeable share of the asic market 
we believe that this long term trend will continue because customers are willing to forego some of the price and performance advantages of hard wired asics in order to obtain the time to market as well as the design and manufacturing flexibility benefits of plds 
o plds plds include simple plds  complex plds cplds  and fpgas 
fpgas have gained share in the pld market because they generally offer greater capacity  lower total cost per usable logic gate  and lower power consumption than simple plds and cplds 
we believe that this long term trend will continue 
our three larger competitors  xilinx corporation xilinx  altera corporation altera  and lattice semiconductor corporation lattice  offer cplds as well as fpgas 
o strategy as the fourth biggest vendor in our market  we do not believe that we can compete across the board  but must choose technologies and markets in which to differentiate ourselves 
our strategy involves considerable risk 
unique technologies and products can take years to develop  if at all  and markets that we target may fail to emerge 
we have in fact sometimes faltered in these areas 
still  we believe that our strategic positioning is the best it has ever been in our history 
o technologies our flash and antifuse technologies are non volatile  so they retain their circuit configuration even in the absence of power 
in contrast to the sram and other memory technologies used by our larger competitors  our fpgas don t need a separate boot device  are live at power up  generally require less power  and offer practically unbreakable design security 
o antifuse the one time programmability of our antifuse fpgas is desirable in certain military and aerospace applications  but commercial customers generally prefer to use reprogrammable fpgas  and fpgas based on all other types of technologies are reprogrammable 
in addition  we are the only sizeable company that uses antifuse technology  which means that we bear the entire burden of developing and proving antifuse processes including yields and reliability and products including switching elements and architectures 
it also means that our fgpas using antifuse technology are one or more generations behind the fpgas of our competitors using sram and other technologies manufactured on standard processes 
o flash we believe that our long term future lies with flash technology  which permits us to make fpgas that are both non volatile and reprogrammable 
while our flash technology is unique  the process is very similar to the standard flash memory process  so we will be able to share with others most of the burden of developing and proving the process 
since flash technology has trailed sram technology by about half a generation  our flash fpgas are still the better part of one generation behind the sram fpgas of our competitors 
o markets the inherent advantages of our non volatile technologies give us a big advantage with some groups of customers  but are of little or no value to others 
o value based we think that this market  which is all about cost  will grow the most and is the best fit for our technologies 
xilinx and altera are also aggressively offering low priced products  so we might not gain share even in this segment of the fpga market  but we re optimistic because we think these customers most value the advantages of our technologies 
selling more low price products may make it more difficult to maintain our gross margins  although we think it can be done 
o high reliability we believe that we are the world s leading supplier of military  avionics  and space grade fpgas  but we are seeing increased competition from xilinx and aeroflex incorporated 
this is a market in which the customers are extremely conscientious and demand the very highest levels of quality and reliability 
to that end  we have conducted analysis of and experiments on the reliability of our rtsx s space qualified fpgas for the last six months at the behest of an ad hoc industry group  and we anticipate that those investigations will continue for at least several more months 
see the risk factors set forth at the end of part i of this annual report on form k for more information 
o high speed speed has historically been a strength of our antifuse technology  but the high speed fpga market is dominated by telecommunications and the sram technology offered by our larger competitors is a better fit for many of these applications 
yet our technologies are a better fit than sram in certain subsets of this very large market  so we continue to believe that we can develop and maintain a business in this area based on our differentiation 
o key indicators although we measure the condition and performance of our business in numerous ways  the key quantitative indicators that we generally use to manage the business are bookings  design wins  margins  yields  and backlog 
we also carefully monitor the progress of our product development efforts 
of these  we think that bookings and backlog are the best indicators of short term performance and that designs wins and product development progress are the best indicators of long term performance 
our bookings measured as end customer orders placed on us and our distributors were higher during than during  and our backlog was higher at the end of than at the end of our design wins were higher in than in  with most of the growth coming in flash 
our product development progress was mixed 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development selling  general  and administrative amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles income loss from operations interest income and other  net of expense gain loss on sales and write downs of equity investments income loss before tax benefit provision tax benefit provision net income loss our fiscal year ends on the first sunday after december fiscal ended on january   fiscal ended on january   and fiscal ended on january  fiscal was a week fiscal year  rather than a normal week fiscal year 
for ease of presentation  december has been indicated as the year end for all fiscal years 
o net revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of fpgas  which accounted for of net revenues in   and non fpga revenues are derived from our protocol design services organization  royalties  and the licensing of software and sale of hardware used to design and program our fpgas 
we believe that we derived more than of our revenues in   and from sales of fpgas to customers serving the military and aerospace and the communications markets 
we have experienced  and may again in the future experience  substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to conditions in each of these markets as well as in the general economy 
net revenues in were million  a increase over this increase was due primarily to a increase in the number of fpga units shipped  which was partially offset by a decrease in the overall average selling price asp of fpgas 
the increase in unit shipments was broad based  with increases in both our new and mature groups of product families 
the new product group includes our proasic plus  proasic  rtsx s  sx a  ex  and asic conversion product families 
the overall asp declined principally because we derived a lower percentage of our revenues from fpga shipments to our military and aerospace customers  which we estimate accounted for of our revenues in compared with in fpgas shipped to military and aerospace customers tend to be higher cost to produce  on average  and have higher asps than fpgas shipped to our other customers 
net revenues in were less than in this decline was due primarily to an decrease in the overall asp of fpgas 
the overall asp declined principally because we derived a higher percentage of our revenues from fpga shipments to customers serving the consumer e appliance and computing markets  which we estimate accounted for of net revenues in compared with in fpgas shipped to customers serving the consumer e appliance and computing markets tend to have lower asps 
we shipped approximately of our net revenues through the distribution sales channel in  compared with in and in our north american distributors during were unique technologies  inc unique and pioneer standard electronics  inc pioneer 
on march   we consolidated our distribution channel by terminating our agreement with pioneer  leaving unique as our sole distributor in north america 
we also consolidated our distribution channel during  when we terminated our agreement with arrow electronics  inc arrow 
the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues derived from each customer that accounted for or more of our net revenues in any of the last three years pioneer unique arrow lockheed martin we do not recognize revenue on product shipped to a distributor until the distributor resells the product to its customer 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of net revenues in  in  and in the largest portion of export sales was to european customers  which accounted for of net revenues in  in  and in o gross margin gross margin was of revenues in compared with in and in gross margin was favorably impacted in by the sell through of million of inventory that was reserved in previous periods  a benefit of to gross margin  and in by the sell through of million of inventory  a benefit of to gross margin 
gross margin was lower in than in and primarily because of higher than normal inventory write offs that resulted from higher inventory levels coupled with lower forecasted customer demand 
we seek to reduce costs by improving wafer yields  negotiating price reductions with suppliers  increasing the level and efficiency of our testing and packaging operations  achieving economies of scale by means of higher production levels  and increasing the number of die produced per wafer  principally by shrinking the die size of our products 
no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
our capability to shrink the die size of our fpgas is dependent on the availability of more advanced manufacturing processes 
due to the custom steps involved in manufacturing antifuse and to a lesser extent flash fpgas  we typically obtain access to new manufacturing processes later than our competitors using standard manufacturing processes 
o research and development r d r d expenditures were million  or of net revenues  in compared with million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in r d expenditures have experienced slight annual increases over each of the past three years as a result of our efforts to concurrently research and develop future generations of flash and antifuse based product families as well as radiation tolerant versions of both flash and antifuse product families 
as a percent of revenues  r d expenditures were a lower percentage of revenues in than in due to the increase in revenues in combined with our efforts to hold spending as flat as possible while still achieving our r d goals 
our r d consists of circuit design  software development  and process technology activities 
we believe that continued substantial investment in r d is critical to maintaining a strong technological position in the industry 
since our antifuse and flash fpgas are manufactured using customized processes  our r d expenditures will probably always be higher as a percentage of net revenues than that of our major competitors using standard manufacturing processes 
o selling  general  and administrative sg a sg a expenses in were million  or of net revenues  compared with million  or of net revenues in and million  or of net revenues  in sg a expenses in increased by million compared with primarily as a result of higher sales bonuses associated with increased net revenues 
sg a was favorably impacted by a million reduction in accruals for estimated legal liabilities in the third quarter of sg a expenses in increased by compared with primarily due to an increase in sg a headcount during and the full effect of additional headcount added over the course of the year in the introduction and rollout of our proasic plus and axcelerator product families in also increased our sales and marketing costs 
these increases in were partially offset by lower selling expenses primarily sales bonuses and outside sales commissions associated with the decrease in net revenues for compared with o amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangibles was million in both and  compared with million in the reduction of amortization from to and was due to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at the beginning of fiscal  which eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact of sfas no 
in  the portion of the amortization expense that related to goodwill was million 
o interest income and other  net of expense interest income and other  net of expense  was million in  million in  and million in the decrease in interest and other income experienced in both and compared with preceding years was primarily a result of lower interest rates available in the market and lower gains realized on our short term investments  which were partially offset by higher cash balances 
for  our average investment portfolio return on investment was compared with in and in our average investment portfolio balance was million in compared with million in and million in we invest excess liquidity in investment portfolios consisting primarily of corporate bonds  floating rate notes  and federal and municipal obligations 
in periods where market interest rates are falling  and for some time after rates stabilize  we typically experience declines in interest income and other as our older debt investments at higher interest rates mature and are replaced by new investments at the lower rates available in the market 
o losses on sales and write downs of equity investments we occasionally make equity investments in public or private companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
during  we realized losses and recorded impairment write downs totaling million in connection with our strategic equity investments  which consisted of million related to an equity investment in a publicly traded company and million related to an equity investment in a private company 
the million of losses related to the investment in a publicly traded company was comprised of million of realized losses on shares sold during the first and second quarters of and million of impairment write downs recorded in the second and fourth quarters of these impairment write downs were recorded as a result of declines in the market value of shares still held by us 
the million loss related to the equity investment in a private company consisted entirely of an impairment write down that was recorded when the estimated fair value of the private company was determined to be below its carrying value after the private company received new financing in the fourth quarter of at a per share price significantly less than our initial investment 
we sold all of our remaining strategic equity investment in a publicly traded company in  realizing a gain of million from the sale 
as of december   we had million of strategic equity investments remaining on the balance sheet 
o tax benefit provision significant components affecting the effective tax rate include pre tax net income or loss  federal r d tax credits  income from tax exempt securities  the state composite tax rate  and recognition of certain deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowances 
our tax provision for was million  which represents an effective tax rate of for the year 
our million tax benefit for was based on the combined effects of a pre tax loss and r d tax credits 
excluding the effect of non deductible goodwill amortization  our effective tax rate was for the exclusion of non deductible goodwill amortization from tax calculations resulted in a net income for tax purposes and a net tax expense for financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources our total assets were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the increase in total assets was attributable principally to increases in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated balance sheets expressed as a percentage change from december   to december  cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments accounts receivable  net inventories current deferred income taxes prepaid expenses and other current assets property and equipment  net other assets  net primarily deferred income taxes and purchased intangible assets other than goodwill total assets total current liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity o cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were million at the end of compared with million at the end of this increase of million from the end of was due primarily to million of net cash provided by operating activities and million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
these increases were partially offset by million of property and equipment purchases 
the significant components within operating activities that provided cash during included million of net tax refunds received during the year and million from the net results for the year adjusted for non cash items million of which relates to depreciation and amortization 
the significant components within operating activities that resulted in a reduction of cash from operations in included million in cash used to increase inventories and a million decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors 
spending on property and equipment amounted to million in  compared with million in and million in the increase in spending on property and equipment in related primarily to leasehold improvements on our new worldwide headquarters which we moved into in august of our capital budget for is million 
cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans amounted to million in  million in  and million in the increase in employee stock plan activity that occurred in was mostly driven by the increase in the market price of our common stock  which had an average closing price per share of in  in  and in employee stock activity was especially heavy during the last six months of  when the average closing price was per share 
we meet all of our funding needs for ongoing operations with internally generated cash flows from operations and with existing cash and short term investment balances 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for a portion of available cash may be used for investment in or acquisition of complementary businesses  products  or technologies 
wafer manufacturers have at times demanded financial support from customers in the form of equity investments and advance purchase price deposits  which in some cases have been substantial 
should we require additional capacity  we may be required to incur significant expenditures to secure such capacity 
the following represents contractual commitments not accrued on the balance sheet associated with operating leases and royalty and licensing agreements as of december  payments due by period total and later in thousands operating leases        royalty licensing agreements     total        purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
we believe that the availability of adequate financial resources is a substantial competitive factor 
to take advantage of opportunities as they arise  or to withstand adverse business conditions when they occur  it may become prudent or necessary for us to raise additional capital 
no assurance can be given that additional capital would become available on acceptable terms if needed 
o accounts receivable our net accounts receivable was million at the end of compared with million at the end of this increase was due primarily to the increase in revenues in the fourth quarter of  compared with the fourth quarter of revenue was million in the fourth quarter of compared with million in the fourth quarter of net accounts receivable represented days of sales outstanding dsos at the end of both and o inventories our net inventories were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the growth in inventory was primarily the result of last time inventory purchases from two wafer manufacturers for some of our mature product families 
last time buys occur when a wafer supplier is about to shut down the manufacturing line used to make a product and current inventories are insufficient to meet foreseeable future demand 
inventory purchased in last time buy transactions will be evaluated on an ongoing basis for indications of excess or obsolescence based on rates of actual sell through  expected future demand for those products  and any other qualitative factors that may indicate the existence of excess or obsolete inventory 
inventory at december   included million of inventory purchased under last time buy type purchases 
inventory days of supply decreased from days at the end of to days at the end of due to the higher cost of sales associated with increased revenues 
excluding the impact of inventory purchased under last time buy type purchases  inventory days of supply were days at the end of our fpgas are manufactured using customized steps that are added to the standard manufacturing processes of our independent wafer suppliers  so our manufacturing cycle is generally longer and more difficult to adjust in response to changing demands or delivery schedules 
accordingly  our inventory model will probably always be higher than that of our major competitors using standard processes 
o property and equipment our net property and equipment was million at the end of  compared with million at the end of we invested million in property and equipment in compared with million in the increase in capital expenditures was related primarily to million of leasehold improvements at our new principal facilities and executive offices in mountain view  california  which we relocated to in august other capital expenditures during the past two years have been primarily for engineering  manufacturing  and office equipment 
depreciation of property and equipment was million in compared with million in our capital budget for is million 
o goodwill our net goodwill was million at the end of both and goodwill is recorded when consideration paid in an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
at the beginning of  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
following our adoption of sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test for impairment annually or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairments tests during the fourth quarter of  and noted no indicators of impairment 
o other assets our other assets were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the decrease was due primarily to million amortization of identified intangible assets  which was partially offset by a million increase in our non current deferred tax asset that was the result of a reclassification between current and non current deferred tax assets 
o current liabilities our total current liabilities were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the decrease was due in part to a reduction of million in deferred income on shipments to distributors 
during  we consolidated our distribution channel  leaving unique as our sole distributor in north america  which had the effect of reducing the amount of product being held in the distribution channel as a single distributor is more efficient in inventory management and does not need to hold as much inventory to meet customer demand as two or more distributors would 
the decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors was partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable of million in as there were no income taxes payable in o shareholders equity shareholders equity was million at the end of compared with million at the end of the increase included retained earnings from net income of million and an increase to additional paid in capital of million from the sale of common stock under employee stock plans 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in may   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires certain financial instruments to be accounted for as liabilities that previously were accounted for as equity 
the financial instruments affected include mandatory redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets  and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not currently have any financial instruments that are subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 so the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued financial standards accounting board interpretation fin no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin  which amended the interpretation in december  establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity vie 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity vie to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
development stage entities that have sufficient equity invested to finance the activities they are currently engaged in and entities that are businesses as defined in the interpretation are not considered vies 
the provisions of fin were effective immediately for all arrangements entered into with new vies created after january  we do not currently have any contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie  so the adoption of fin had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and also require us to make the most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based upon this definition  our most critical policies include inventories  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  and legal matters 
these policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  are discussed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or they are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  it could result in material expenses being recognized on the income statement 
o inventories we believe that a certain level of inventory must be carried to maintain an adequate supply of product for customers 
this inventory level may vary based upon orders received from customers or internal forecasts of demand for these products 
other considerations in determining inventory levels include the stage of products in the product life cycle  design win activity  manufacturing lead times  customer demands  strategic relationships with foundries  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
should any of these factors develop other than anticipated  inventory levels may be materially and adversely affected 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
to address this difficult  subjective  and complex area of judgment  we apply a methodology that includes assumptions and estimates to arrive at the net realizable value 
first  we identify any inventory that has been previously written down in prior periods 
this inventory remains written down until sold  destroyed  or otherwise dispositioned 
second  our quality assurance personnel examine inventory line items that may have some form of obsolescence due to non conformance with electrical and mechanical standards 
third  we assess the inventory not otherwise identified to be written down against product history and forecasted demand typically for the next six months 
finally  we analyze the result of this methodology in light of the product life cycle  design win activity  and competitive situation in the marketplace to derive an outlook for consumption of the inventory and the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during  we had significant write downs of inventory due to a sharp decrease in forecasted demand related to the general economic slowdown 
during  we modified our inventory valuation policies to properly account for last time buy inventory purchases 
last time buys occur when a wafer supplier is about to shut down the manufacturing line used to make a product and current inventories are insufficient to meet foreseeable future demand 
we made last time buys of certain products from our wafer suppliers in since this inventory was not acquired to meet current demand  we did not believe the application of our existing inventory write down policy was appropriate  so a discrete write down policy was established for inventory purchased in last time buy transactions 
as a consequence  these transactions and the related inventory are excluded from the standard excess and obsolescence write down policy 
inventory purchased in last time buy transactions will be evaluated on an ongoing basis for indications of excess or obsolescence based on rates of actual sell through  expected future demand for those products over a longer time horizon  and any other qualitative factors that may indicate the existence of excess or obsolete inventory 
in the event that actual sell through does not meet expectations and estimations of expected future demand decrease  last time buy inventory could be written down in the future 
evaluations of last time buy inventory in did not result in any write downs 
o intangible assets and goodwill in past years we made business acquisitions that resulted in the recording of a significant amount of goodwill and identified intangible assets 
historically and through the end of  goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over its useful life 
at the beginning of  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased to amortize goodwill and instead test for impairment annually or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarter of and noted no impairment 
the initial test of goodwill impairment requires us to compare our fair value with our book value  including goodwill 
we are a single reporting unit as defined by sfas and use the entity wide approach to compare fair value to book value 
based on our total market capitalization  which we believe represents the best indicator of our fair value  we determined that our fair value was in excess of our book value 
since we found no indication of impairment  we did not proceed with step of the annual impairment analysis 
at december   we had identified intangible assets arising from prior business acquisitions which are being amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we recognize impairment losses on identified intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
the impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is based on discounted cash flows using present value techniques identified in sfas no 
we assessed our identified intangible assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
as of december   and noted no impairment 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  it could result in lower estimated future cash flows that may not support the current carrying value of these assets  which would require us to record impairment charges for these assets 
o income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and  if necessary  we adjust the amount of such allowance 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
o legal matters as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we have been and expect to be notified from time to time of claims  including claims that we may be infringing patents owned by others 
during  we held settlement discussions with several third parties 
when probable and reasonably estimable  we make provision for estimated liabilities 
as we sometimes have in the past  we may settle disputes and or obtain licenses under patents that we are alleged to infringe 
during  we settled a threatened patent infringement claim and obtained licenses under the patents that we were alleged to infringe 
as a result of the settlement  we reduced our accruals for estimated legal liabilities by million  which had a favorable impact on sg a spending in the third quarter of 
we can offer no assurance that any pending or threatened claim will be resolved or that the resolution of any such claims will not have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
in addition  our evaluation of the impact of these pending and threatened claims could change based upon new information learned by us 
subject to the foregoing  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending or threatened legal claim is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
risks our operating results are subject to general economic conditions and a variety of risks characteristic of the semiconductor industry or specific to us  including booking and shipment uncertainties  wafer supply fluctuations  and price erosion  any of which could cause our operating results to differ materially from past results 
see the risk factors set forth at the end of part i of this annual report on form k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of corporate bonds  floating rate notes  and federal and municipal obligations 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  meet liquidity needs  and maximize yields 
to meet these objectives  we invest excess liquidity only in high credit quality debt securities with average maturities of less than two years 
we also limit the percentage of total investments that may be invested in any one issuer 
corporate investments as a group are also limited to a maximum percentage of our investment portfolio 
our debt security investments  which totaled million at december   are subject to interest rate risk 
an increase in interest rates could subject us to a decline in the market value of our investments 
these risks are mitigated by our ability to hold these investments to maturity 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates compared with interest rates at december   and december   would result in a reduction of approximately million in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities held at december   and million in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities held at december  the potential changes noted above are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position and expected operating levels at december  actual results may differ materially
