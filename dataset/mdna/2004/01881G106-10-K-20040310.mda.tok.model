alliance capital alliance capital earns revenues by providing diversified investment management services  which includes charging fees for managing the investment assets of clients 
accordingly  management is focused on increasing the amount of assets under management aum by alliance capital and its subsidiaries 
increases in aum result from appreciation in the value of these assets  and from inflows of additional assets from new and existing clients 
conversely  the amount of aum can decline due to market depreciation and from client redemptions 
moreover  additional asset inflows and redemptions are driven  in part  by relative investment performance 
the growth of institutional asset management remained strong  driven primarily by increased acceptance of the firm s global investment platforms in growth  value and fixed income  especially among clients domiciled outside the us 
large cap value services grew substantially and generally outperformed benchmarks in large cap growth services experienced net redemptions and generally underperformed benchmarks  owing to in part to their emphasis on high quality companies with above average capitalizations  a segment of the growth universe that trailed broad market returns 
other institutional growth services generally outperformed their benchmarks  in some cases by a substantial margin 
institutional fixed income services generally outperformed their benchmarks  with the exception of high yield 
long term results remain competitive in most services 
retail value equity had strong performance over all periods relative to lipper averages 
large cap growth and technology services underperformed the lipper averages while mid cap  global growth research and other services outperformed their benchmarks 
retail fixed income funds generally outperformed their benchmark  with the exception of the high yield fund which underperformed the lipper average 
the private client channel continued to perform well in balanced accounts led their global benchmarks for both short and long term periods

the operating partnership s institutional research services showed continued growth in the development of its uk operations  sanford c 
bernstein limited scbl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership  while revenues declined domestically in driven by lower new york stock exchange nyse transaction volume and lower price realization 
however  sanford c 
bernstein co  llc scb llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership  did experience continued and growing client acceptance of its over the counter and program trading platforms and  in addition  scb llc continues to be an industry leader in quality metrics and research 
management believes institutional research services are well positioned for growth in overall revenues in in connection with the settlement agreement reached with the nyag  the operating partnership agreed to a weighted average reduction in fees of with respect to investment advisory agreements with its sponsored us long term open end retail mutual funds for a minimum of five years which commenced january  this reduction in fees is expected to reduce alliance capital revenues by approximately million in transfer agency fees were lowered in the fourth quarter of it is anticipated that management will further lower such fees in management s focus on retail mutual funds will be aimed at simplifying its retail product offerings  achieving transparency in product offering disclosures and strengthening the funds sales and marketing efforts 
management believes such actions will lead to lower costs to mutual fund shareholders in the form of lower expense ratios thereby leading to higher returns 
additionally  continued growth is anticipated in certain alliance mutual funds including annuities  offshore mutual funds and managed account business 
as a result of charges for mutual fund matters and legal proceedings  distributions to unitholders were suspended for the fourth quarter of distributions are expected to resume for the first quarter of  with the payout policy returning to traditional levels in relation to cash flow for the second quarter of management of the operating partnership is looking forward to an improved operating environment in  however  capital markets are subject to change and future operating results can not be predicted with certainty

the operating partnership s mutual fund distribution system includes a multi class share structure 
the system permits the operating partnership s open end mutual funds to offer investors various options for the purchase of mutual fund shares  including the purchase of front end load shares and back end load shares 
the front end load shares are subject to a conventional front end sales charge paid by investors to abirm at the time of sale 
abirm in turn pays sales commissions to the financial intermediaries distributing the funds from the front end sales charge it receives from investors 
for back end load shares  investors do not pay a front end sales charge although  if there are redemptions before the expiration of the minimum holding period which ranges from one year to four years  investors pay a contingent deferred sales charge cdsc to abirm 
while abirm is obligated to pay sales commissions to the financial intermediaries at the time of the purchase of back end load shares  it receives higher ongoing distribution services fees from the mutual funds

of the million total  million is intended to provide back up liquidity for the operating partnership s million commercial paper program  with the balance available for general purposes of the operating partnership  including capital expenditures and funding the payment of deferred sales commissions to financial intermediaries under the system 
under this revolving credit facility  the interest rate  at the option of the operating partnership  is a floating rate generally based upon a defined prime rate  a rate related to the london interbank offered rate libor or the federal funds rate 
the credit facility also provides for a facility fee payable on the total facility 
in addition  a utilization rate fee is payable in the event the average aggregate daily outstanding balance exceeds million for each calendar quarter 
the revolving credit facility contains covenants which  among other things  require the operating partnership to meet certain financial ratios 
at december   the operating partnership maintained a million extendible commercial notes ecn program as a supplement to its million commercial paper program 
ecns are short term uncommitted debt instruments that do not require back up liquidity support 
in august  the operating partnership issued million notes senior notes in a public offering 
the operating partnership may issue up to million in senior debt securities 
the senior notes mature in and are redeemable at any time 
the proceeds from the senior notes were used to reduce commercial paper and credit facility borrowings and for other general partnership purposes 
in february  the operating partnership signed a million agreement with a commercial bank  under which it guaranteed certain obligations of scbl incurred in the ordinary course of its business in the event scbl is unable to meet those obligations 
if scbl is unable to satisfy any guaranteed obligation in full when due  the operating partnership will pay such obligation within three days of being notified of scbl s failure to pay 
this agreement is continuous and remains in effect until payment in full of any such obligation has been made by scbl

the operating partnership s substantial equity base and access to public and private debt  at competitive terms  should provide adequate liquidity for its general business needs 
management believes that cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and alliance capital or alliance holding units will provide the operating partnership with the financial resources to meet its capital requirements for mutual fund sales and its other working capital requirements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management of the operating partnership believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgement due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
deferred sales commission asset significant assumptions utilized to estimate the operating partnership s future average assets under management of back end load shares include expected future market levels and redemption rates 
market assumptions are selected using a long term view of expected average market returns based on historical returns of broad market indices 
at december   the operating partnership s management used average market return assumptions of for fixed income and for equity to estimate annual market returns 
higher actual average market returns would increase undiscounted future cash flows  while lower actual average market returns would decrease undiscounted future cash flows 
future redemption rate assumptions were determined by reference to actual redemption experience over the three year and five year periods ended december  the operating partnership s management used a range of expected annual redemption rates of to at december   calculated as a percentage of average assets under management of the operating partnership 
an increase in the actual rate of redemptions would decrease undiscounted future cash flows  while a decrease in the actual rate of redemptions would increase undiscounted future cash flows 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated quarterly  or monthly when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from these assumptions 
the operating partnership s management considers the results of these analyses performed at various dates 
as of december   the operating partnership s management determined that the deferred sales commission asset was not impaired 
if the operating partnership s management determines in the future that the deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable  an impairment condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is determined using the operating partnership s management s best estimate of future cash flows discounted to a present value amount 
during  equity markets increased by approximately as measured by the change in the standard poor s stock index and fixed income markets increased by approximately as measured by the change in the lehman brothers aggregate bond index 
the redemption rate for domestic back end load shares was approximately in declines in financial markets or higher redemption levels  or both  as compared to the assumptions used to estimate undiscounted future cash flows  as described above  could result in the impairment of the deferred sales commission asset 
due to the volatility of the capital markets and changes in redemption rates  the operating partnership s management is unable to predict whether or when a future impairment of the deferred sales commission asset might occur 
should an impairment occur  any loss would reduce materially the recorded amount of the operating partnership s asset with a corresponding charge to the operating partnership s expense 
alliance holding s proportionate share of the operating partnership s charge to expense would reduce materially alliance holding s net income 
goodwill significant assumptions are required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include determining whether the operating partnership  the reporting unit  estimated fair value exceeds its book value 
there are several methods of estimating the operating partnership s fair values  which includes valuation techniques such as market quotations and expected discounted cash flows 
in developing estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation technique  business growth rate assumptions are applied over the estimated life of the goodwill asset and the resulting expected cash flows are discounted to arrive at a present value amount that approximates fair value 
as of december   the goodwill asset impairment test did not indicate that this asset was impaired 
however  future tests may be based upon different assumptions which may or may not result in an impairment of this asset 
should impairment occur  any loss would reduce materially the recorded amount of the operating partnership s asset with a corresponding charge to the operating partnership s expense 
intangible assets acquired intangibles are recognized at fair value and amortized over their estimated useful life 
intangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
future cash flow estimates are used to test the intangible assets for recoverability 
a present value technique is used to estimate the fair value of intangible assets using future cash flow estimates 
the estimates used include estimating attrition factors of customer accounts  asset growth rates  direct expenses and fee rates 
developing these estimates requires highly uncertain assumptions as they are dependent upon historical trends that may or may not occur in the future 
however  future tests may be based upon different assumptions which may or may not result in an impairment of this asset 
should impairment occur  any loss would reduce materially the recorded amount of the operating partnership s asset with a corresponding charge to the operating partnership s expense 
commitments and contingencies the operating partnership s capital commitments  which consist primarily of operating leases for office space  are generally funded from future operating cash flows 
contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in millions debt operating leases  accrued compensation and benefits minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries total  at december   the operating partnership recorded charges totaling million to cover restitution  litigation and other costs  in connection with the terms reached with the nyag and sec with respect to market timing investigations into certain alliance mutual funds and other litigation 
in january  the operating partnership paid million in respect of the restitution fund plus additional amounts in respect of other litigation 
certain of the operating partnership s deferred compensation plans provide for the election by participants to receive alliance holding units or alliance sponsored mutual funds 
from time to time  the operating partnership will fund participant elections and during the first two months of  the operating partnership made purchases of the cash equivalent of the notional value of alliance sponsored mutual funds totaling million
