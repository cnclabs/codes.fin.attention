legislation can also influence demand for products and profitability 
legislation was effective in germany on january   which increased the pharmaceutical manufacturer rebate from to 
in addition  the co payments required by patients increased as of january  the impact of the increased rebate will be to lower annual gross profits by approximately million 
the increase in co payments increased demand for certain products in the fourth quarter of as certain patients bought their prescriptions prior to the increase in the required co payment 
the increase in fourth quarter demand will be offset by a likely decrease in first quarter demand 
success in the generic industry depends on developing  manufacturing and marketing new products  including generic versions of products no longer subject to patent protection

certain of the company s subsidiaries have terms of fob shipping point where title and risk of loss transfer on shipment 
certain subsidiaries have terms fob destination where title and risk of loss transfer on delivery 
in the case of fob destination  revenue is not recognized until products are received by the customer 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations

goodwill and intangible assets the company has completed several acquisitions since  which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by the company 
in addition  in  upon adoption of sfas  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and reviewed goodwill upon transition and at each year end for impairment 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations 
these allocations  including an assessment of estimated useful lives  have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
asset impairments long lived assets  including plant and equipment  and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a dimunition in value may have occurred  based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset 
if the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with sfas the assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the company  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by the asset  including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action  the risk associated with those cash flows  and the company s cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized 
in the case of asset or business divestitures the difficulty of assessing a potential impairment is intensified 
the sale of a business or asset is not assured regardless of the intention of the company until an unrelated third party and the company reach a mutually acceptable agreement 
while both parties can genuinely want an agreement  no divestiture is probable until a final agreement has been negotiated and signed 
the company has certain assets not presently fully utilized for production which are expected to be operational in these under utilized or idle assets also require judgment in determining their probable future cash flows 
presently the value is expected to be recovered 
if plans for use materially change an impairment charge could be required 
research and development r d  including in process r d ipr d the company s products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  principally the food and drug administration fda in the united states and equivalent authorities in international markets 
research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred  as the company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs 
with respect to completed acquisitions  acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility  signified by fda or comparable regulatory body approval  are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits 
estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in goodwill and intangible assets above 
acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility ie  regulatory approval are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
in connection with its acquisitions  the company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of ipr d charges 
the amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project  the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project  and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis for all inventories 
the determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors  including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices 
inventories determined to be damaged  obsolete  or otherwise unsaleable are written down to net realizable value 
the company also purchases raw materials  and manufactures finished goods  for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation 
the company reviews these inventories on a case by case basis  and records a write down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained  litigation will be resolved unfavorably  or the inventory s cost will not be recoverable based on other factors 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pension  post retirement  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost and trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries 
litigation and contingencies the company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business  and also to certain other contingencies see item of this form k and note to the financial statements 
the company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred 
additionally  the company assesses  in consultation with its counsel  the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis 
reserves are recorded when the company  in consultation with counsel  determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowance principally relates to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income 
the company has recorded certain us deferred tax assets for which it has provided no valuation allowances 
these us deferred tax assets  as well as any newly generated deferred tax assets  are evaluated quarterly to assess the likelihood of realization  which is ultimately dependent upon generating future us taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
if it were considered to be more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets would not be realized  a valuation allowance would be established against some or all of the deferred tax assets 
as a result of the company s assessment of its net us deferred tax assets of approximately million at december   based upon certain available tax planning strategies  the company considers it more likely than not that these net us deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and therefore  no valuation allowance was required at december  should it be determined in the future that it is no longer more likely than not that these assets will be realized  a valuation allowance would be required and the company s operating results would be adversely affected during the period in which such determination would be made 
the company is considering a number of asset divestitures 
it is possible that certain divestitures will result in a loss for tax and book purposes 
depending on the jurisdiction in which the loss occurs and the size of the loss it is possible that certain potential losses will require a valuation allowance for a portion of all of the deferred tax benefit recorded 
liquidity and capital resources at december   stockholders equity was  million compared to  million and million at december   and  respectively

cash flows reflect net income of million  non cash expenses for depreciation  amortization and interest accretion totaling million 
cash flow from operations in was negatively impacted by million in debt placement fees paid in connection with the issuance of senior notes in the second quarter 
better working capital management and other items make up the balance of the cash provided by operating activities in cash flows reflected the generally non cash nature of charges incurred in both the asset write downs and the debt reduction required substantial non cash charges 
cash flow reflected the non cash nature of a number of items which contributed to the net loss for the year 
the million ipr d charge  the inventory write offs of million  and the million charge on exchange of the convertible debentures for class a common stock are significant non cash charges 
in  accounts receivable balances increased million  net of foreign currency  compared to this resulted in an increase in days sales outstanding of approximately days in versus days in  principally due to the geographic mix of business

this emphasis has generally yielded positive results  although not all customers follow stated terms and disputes can slow collection 
the company reduced accounts receivable balances in and compared to the preceding years by million and million  respectively 
the change in marketing strategy in ah  which reduced the use of sales incentives including terms  in the fourth quarter of resulted in approximately million of the decline 
the emphasis on accounts receivable management  mentioned above  also contributed to these declines

these increases in balance sheet amounts impact to some degree the above mentioned ratios 
the approximate increase due to currency translation of selected captions was accounts receivable million  inventories million  accounts payable and accrued expenses million  and total stockholder s equity million

a portion of the company s short term and long term debt is at variable interest rates 
the credit facility requires the company to enter into swaps such that interest is fixed on of its debt 
at december   the company has one outstanding interest rate agreement to fix interest rates for million of its variable rate debt to minimize the impact of future changes in interest rates 
the company s policy is to selectively enter into standard agreements to fix interest rates for existing debt if it is deemed prudent 
in the fourth quarter of the company completed the acquisition of the faulding oral pharmaceuticals business opb and entered into a million credit facility credit facility to finance the acquisition and replace its previous credit agreement 
the credit facility includes covenants that require it to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial conditions consisting of a maximum total leverage ratio test  a maximum senior secured leverage ratio test  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test  a minimum interest coverage ratio test and a minimum net worth test 
a breach of any of these covenants  if not cured or waived  could result in a default under the credit facility 
if an event of default under the credit facility occurs  the lenders under these facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
the calculation of ebi tda  as defined in the credit facility  on a rolling four quarter basis is important to many of these tests 
certain of these covenants became more restrictive as of december  and will become more restrictive at march  the company is in compliance with these covenants as of december  continued compliance with these financial covenants throughout is dependent on the company s ebitda as defined by the credit agreement  and therefore the company s ability to generate increasing amounts of operating income  or on the company s ability to reduce the amount of its outstanding debt 
since  the company has reduced the amount of its outstanding debt and the size of the original facility by prepaying term debt by million and by lowering the revolving line of credit by million

operating income in has been negatively affected by compliance activities in two of ushp s plants 
significant corrective action costs have been incurred as a result of the company s response to form s issued by the fda for the company s baltimore and elizabeth plants 
in addition  the corrective action plans have resulted in lower production and significant rationalization of the liquids product line at the baltimore plant and no new product introductions during  from either plant 
full year compliance costs amount to million  of which approximately million relates to external consultants see footnote for further details 
the additional internal staffing levels are necessary to support the company s commitment to fda compliance and are expected to continue beyond the corrective action period 
external consulting costs declined sequentially in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of and are expected to continue at the fourth quarter rate of approximately million into it is the company s expectation that it will substantially complete corrective actions in elizabeth and baltimore in  subject to reviews by the fda 
the company is preparing for possible fda re inspections of both facilities 
during most of  the company s most restrictive debt covenant was total debt to ebitda total leverage ratio 
this covenant tightens from a required maximum ratio of to at december  to a required maximum ratio of to at march  the company remains in compliance with all its debt covenants at december   with approximately million of ebitda flexibility on its tightest covenant at year end  the interest coverage ratio 
the company has developed its business and financial plan for and has evaluated its flexibility in complying with each of the financial covenants as part of this process 
the company believes it has a number of options available to provide it with increased financial flexibility  thereby ensuring continued compliance with its covenants 
certain of these options are entirely within the company s control and others require actions of the bank group and or a third party 
in december  the credit facility was amended to allow for certain actions associated with the company s ability to achieve increased financial flexibility 
the amendment includes provisions enabling the company to sell certain assets  provides for additional flexibility in the timing and application of certain financial ratio tests  and permits exclusions of certain restructuring charges and gains and losses on potential divestitures of assets and businesses from the calculation of ebitda 
options include continued aggressive asset management  including both working capital reduction programs and controls over capital expenditures  to generate free cash flow to enable the company to continue to repay outstanding debt 
capital expenditures and purchased intangibles were million for the year ended december  compared to million the year ended december  in  capital expenditures are forecasted at approximately million 
continue to reduce operating costs

this charge was partially offset by savings in the quarter 
the company expects this workforce reduction to generate annual cost savings of approximately million in and million in subsequent years 
the company is evaluating other actions to reduce its cost base in and beyond 
continue to sell certain assets 
in  the company has sold its french generics business and an animal health facility 
the company recently engaged investment bankers to explore the possible sale of certain other assets 
the potential divestiture of significant assets and businesses are in the preliminary stages and none are subject to formal agreements 
it is possible that  if completed  certain of the divestitures could result in losses of up to million 
there is no guarantee any divestiture will be completed 
due to its improved liquidity in  the company is not under any financial pressure to accept any offer which is not in its long term interests

in the th quarter of  the bank group agreed to an amendment which allowed for specified asset sales  permitted exclusions of restructuring and refinancing charges from ebitda of up to million and the minimum net worth definitions  and amended the leverage ratios to delay the timing of further covenant restrictions 
the company believes that its performance in the reduction of the loan  and its previous experience in working with the bank group would assist it in obtaining future amendments  if necessary 
while the company cannot assure its success in executing any of the above noted actions or  where required in obtaining external party consent  it will take the actions necessary to maintain sufficient financial flexibility with its debt covenants and remain in compliance throughout at december   the company s contractual cash obligations in millions can be summarized as follows contractual cash commitments total less than year years years more than years long term debt senior and other convertible subordinated operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash commitments can be settled in shares of the company s class a common stock at option of holder

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company s earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s risk management practice includes the selective use  on a limited basis  of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate agreements 
such instruments are used for purposes other than trading 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate movements create fluctuations in us dollar reported amounts of foreign subsidiaries whose local currencies are their respective functional currencies 
the company has not used foreign currency derivative instruments to manage translation fluctuations 
the company and its respective subsidiaries primarily use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain cash flows denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary s functional currency 
such cash flows are normally represented by actual receivables and payables and anticipated receivables and payables for which there is a firm commitment 
at december   the company had forward foreign exchange contracts mainly denominated in euros  danish krones  norwegian krones  british pounds and us dollars with a notional amount of million 
the fair market value of such contracts has been recognized in the financial statements and is not material 
all contracts expire in the first three quarters of the cash flows expected from the contracts will generally offset the cash flows of related non functional currency transactions 
the change in value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulting from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates would be less than million and generally would be offset by the change in value of the hedged receivable or payable 
such contracts are not designated hedges for accounting purposes 
alpharma s interest rate risk relates primarily to long term and short term debt which has variable interest rates and reset generally every three months 
at december   the company has million of variable rate us dollar debt under its credit agreement
