in management s discussion and analysis  we provide information about our general business risks  critical accounting policies and estimates  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and certain other matters affecting our operating results for the periods covered by this report 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income loss  which present the results of our operations for   and  and are summarized on the following pages 
we analyze and explain the differences between periods for the components of net income loss in the following sections 
our analysis is important in making decisions about your investment in sitel corporation 
general business risks  critical accounting policies and estimates general business risks our business success depends on our ability to efficiently deploy our human and capital resources in the delivery of services to our clients 
consequently  the needs of our clients may significantly impact our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
our results of operations and operating cash flows may vary with periodic wins and losses of client contracts and with changes in the scope of client requirements 
our top clients accounted for   and of our revenue in   and and includes multiple independently managed business units of general motors corporation 
these general motors business units were responsible for  and of our total revenue in  and we signed agreements to extend until january  two of our primary contracts with general motors 
we did not have any other clients under common control that generated more than of our total revenue in  and the financial failure of any of these clients or the loss of any or all of their business could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our liquidity  including our ability to comply with debt covenants  may be adversely affected if we were to lose a significant client or as a result of significant changes in client demand if we are unable to efficiently re deploy our human and capital resources 
we have operations in many parts of the world and therefore our financial statements can be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations 
fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore significantly impact comparisons with prior periods 
in the following sections  we also discuss the importance of our critical accounting policies and the use of accounting estimates  and their potential impacts on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies and practices are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
of those policies  we have identified the following to be critical accounting policies because they are the most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition  and they require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments revenue recognition we recognize revenue as services are performed for our clients in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue at the time services are performed based on an hourly  monthly  per call or per employee rate detailed in the client contract 
a portion of our revenue is often subject to performance standards  such as sales per hour  average handle time  occupancy rate and abandonment rate 
our performance against such standards may result in bonuses or penalties  which are recognized as earned or incurred 
in certain circumstances  we receive payment in advance of providing service 
accordingly  amounts billed but not earned under these contracts are excluded from revenue and included in deferred revenue and other in the consolidated balance sheet 
revenue for services performed under certain collection service agreements are recognized as the related consumer debts are collected and are calculated based upon a percentage of cash collected or other agreed upon contractual parameters 
trade accounts receivable we report our trade accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which represents management s estimates of the amount of our receivables that may not be collectible  net of recoveries of amounts previously written off 
these estimates are based on a detailed aging analysis of accounts receivable  historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  and changes in our client payment terms 
the financial condition of our clients may deteriorate  which may require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we would record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as operating  selling  and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of income loss  which would reduce our results of operations 
property and equipment we record property and equipment at cost  and calculate depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years 
we amortize leasehold improvements and assets under capital leases on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
if the actual useful lives of these assets are less than the estimated depreciable lives  we would record additional depreciation expense or losses on disposal to the extent the net book value of such asset is not recovered upon sale 
asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
triggering events include a significant change in the extent or manner in which long lived assets are being used or in its physical condition  in legal factors  or in the business climate that could affect the value of the long lived assets 
the interpretation of such events requires judgment from management as to whether such an event has occurred 
upon the occurrence of a triggering event  the carrying amount of a long lived asset is reviewed to assess whether the recoverable amount has declined below its carrying amount 
the recoverable amount is the estimated net future cash flows that we expect to recover from the future use of the asset  undiscounted and without interest  plus the asset s residual value on disposal 
where the recoverable amount of the long lived asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its fair value  which is based on discounted estimated cash flows from the future use of the asset 
the estimated cash flows arising from future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what we would expect to recover from future use of the asset 
any changes in the estimates of cash flows arising from future use of the asset or the residual value of the asset on disposal based on changes in the market conditions  changes in the use of the assets  management s plans  and the determination of the useful life of the assets could significantly change the recoverable amount of the asset or the calculation of the fair value and the resulting impairment loss  which could significantly affect the results of operations 
goodwill we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  as of january  as a result of the adoption of this standard  we stopped amortizing our goodwill  including equity method goodwill  and completed the required impairment review 
as a result of the impairment review  we determined that the goodwill in certain reporting units was impaired and we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change as of january  at least annually or more frequently  as changes in circumstances indicate  we will evaluate the estimated fair value of our goodwill 
on these evaluation dates  to the extent that the carrying value of the net assets of any of our reporting units having goodwill is greater than their estimated fair value  we will be required to take additional goodwill impairment charges 
we are required to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding the fair value of goodwill when assessing for impairment 
changes in the fact patterns underlying such assumptions and estimates could ultimately result in the recognition of additional impairment losses 
effective as of october   we completed the annual evaluation of our goodwill and determined no impairment charge was required 
deferred income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
if enacted tax rates change  we would adjust the deferred tax assets and liabilities  through the provision for income taxes in the period of change  to reflect the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when the deferred tax items reverse 
to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate  the period over which the deferred tax assets can be recovered and available tax planning strategies 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including our current and past performance  the market environment in which we operate  the utilization of past tax credits  length of carryback and carryforward periods  and existing or prospective contracts that will result in future profits 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years in certain tax jurisdictions 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
we have established valuation allowances for future tax benefits related to net operating losses incurred in certain federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions for the year ended december  we expect to continue to record a valuation allowance on future tax benefits in certain tax jurisdictions until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained 
until an appropriate level of profitability is reached  we do not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in future results of operations 
if future taxable income is lower than expected or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  we may record additional valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
contingencies we consider the likelihood of various loss contingencies  including tax and legal contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business  and our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
results of operations in this section  we discuss our operating results and the factors affecting them 
we describe our general business risks  critical accounting policies  and estimates that are important to our operating results on the previous pages

components of net income loss as you read this section  please refer to the following table that summarizes our income statement data on a percentage of revenue basis

compared to revenue revenue increased million  or  in compared to the changes in revenue by geographic region are shown in the following table change change in millions north america europe asia pacific latin america totals the decrease in north america revenue in compared to was due primarily to a million decline in customer care and customer acquisition services we provided to a number of our clients partially offset by a million increase in revenue by our technical support services and risk management business 
the primary reason for the decrease in revenue is due to pricing pressure resulting from excess capacity in north america  created primarily by the movement of business offshore 
the transfer of certain business to lower cost labor markets offshore results in lower revenue for the same volume of business 
european revenue increased million in compared to the same period in higher sales volumes from new and existing clients and the implementation of multiple pan european client accounts that commenced in early resulted in an increase in revenue of million in compared to the weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound and euro accounted for the remaining million of the increase 
asia pacific revenue increased million in compared to excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency  revenue decreased million compared to as a result of lower volumes 
as a result of certain revisions in the governance of a joint venture  we reported our investment in certain latin america affiliates using the equity method of accounting  rather than the consolidation method  effective october  as a result of the change in accounting  latin america revenue declined million in compared to the strengthening of the us dollar accounted for a million decrease in latin american revenue in compared to excluding the impact of the change in accounting and the impact of changes in foreign currency  latin american revenue increased million in compared to as a result of higher sale volumes 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses direct labor and telecommunications expenses include the compensation of our customer service professionals and their first line supervisors and telephone usage expenses directly related to the production of revenue 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary based on the nature of the contract  the nature of the work  and the market in which the services are provided 
accordingly  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary  sometimes significantly  from year to year 
as a percentage of revenue  direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased to in compared to in pricing pressure resulting from continuing excess capacity created primarily by movement of business offshore and the ramp costs of new programs in north america and europe were the primary reasons for the increase in compared to subcontracted and other services expenses subcontracted and other services expenses include services provided to clients through subcontractors and other out of pocket expenses 
subcontracted and other services expenses in remained consistent compared to operating  selling and administrative expenses operating  selling and administrative expenses represent expenses incurred to directly support and manage the business  including costs of management  administration  technology  facilities  depreciation and amortization  maintenance  sales and marketing  and client support services 
operating  selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to the change in accounting of certain latin american affiliates as described previously  reduced operating  selling and administrative expenses million in compared to the weakening of the us dollar compared to the primary currency in the jurisdictions in which we operate accounted for a million increase in compared to excluding the impact of the change in accounting and the impact of changes in foreign currency  operating  selling and administrative expenses increased million in compared to as a percentage of revenue  operating  selling and administrative expenses increased to in compared to in primarily as a result of increased investments in infrastructure to support european expansions and increased costs associated with expanded sales programs 
asset impairment and restructuring expenses during  in connection with the closure of our former headquarters facility and the closure of a contact center  we recorded asset impairment and restructuring expenses of million  which consisted of the write off of abandoned leasehold improvements of million and for million of scheduled payments of operating leases for which we will receive no future economic benefit 
in addition  we recorded asset impairment and restructuring expenses of million as a result of a revision to our estimate for non cancelable lease payments associated with a previously announced facility closure 
during  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million primarily associated with a revision to our estimate for non cancelable lease payments associated with a facility closure in connection with the restructuring plan 
operating income operating income decreased million in compared to due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  increased million in compared to as a result of higher average borrowings 
equity in earnings of affiliates the decrease in equity in earnings of affiliates in compared to primarily relates to reduced earnings from our india joint venture due to changes in client mix and higher ramp up costs 
other expense  net other expense  net  decreased million in compared to the decrease was primarily a result of foreign currency remeasurement gains arising from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency offset by impairment charges of million to reduce our basis in investments to fair value 
based upon our review of our investee s financial condition  results of operations and operating trends and the implied value from recent rounds of financing completed by the investee  we determined that an other than temporary impairment existed for two of our investments 
income tax expense the effective tax rate for was significantly more than the us statutory rate which was primarily the result of not reflecting any significant tax benefits for the current net operating losses in certain federal  state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
in  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes  minority interest and change in accounting method  excluding a million increase in our deferred tax valuation allowance  was 
the difference between this rate and the statutory us federal rate of was primarily due to net operating losses in certain european and asia pacific subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized and us state and local income taxes offset by lower international tax rates in certain jurisdictions 
compared to revenue revenue increased million  or  in compared to the increases in revenue by geographic region are shown in the following table change change in millions north america europe asia pacific latin america totals the increase in north america revenue was mostly due to additional customer care and customer acquisition services we provided to a number of our large global clients and to new work performed by our risk management business 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in technical support services 
the weakening of the us dollar versus the british pound and euro accounted for about million  or  of the increase in europe along with the ramp of new customer programs 
the increase in latin america revenue was due mostly to new work we performed for clients in mexico and to revenue from our panama site  as we began serving clients from that facility during the fourth quarter of as a result of certain revisions in the governance of a joint venture  we reported our investment in certain latin america affiliates using the equity method of accounting  rather than the consolidation method  effective october  as a result of this change  our latin america revenue will no longer include the revenue associated with the joint venture 
our revenue was approximately million lower due to the change in accounting 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses direct labor and telecommunications expenses include the compensation of our customer service professionals and their first line supervisors and telephone usage expenses directly related to the production of revenue 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary based on the nature of the contract  the nature of the work  and the market in which the services are provided 
accordingly  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue can vary  sometimes significantly  from year to year 
direct labor and telecommunications expenses increased million  or  in compared to as a percentage of revenue  direct labor and telecommunications expenses decreased from in to in however  as we discuss in the following section  we subcontract certain client services to our india joint venture 
we do not incur direct labor and telecommunication expenses for these subcontracted services  as such costs are incurred by the joint venture 
excluding the revenue we have recorded from clients where we have subcontracted the services to our india joint venture  direct labor and telecommunications expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from in compared to in  primarily due to lower unit prices from our clients 
subcontracted and other services expenses subcontracted and other services expenses include services provided to clients through subcontractors and other out of pocket expenses 
subcontracted and other services expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase in these expenses was mostly due to subcontracted expenses of million paid to our india joint venture as we began serving clients from that facility during the third quarter of operating  selling and administrative expenses operating  selling and administrative expenses represent expenses incurred to directly support and manage the business  including costs of management  administration  technology  facilities  depreciation and amortization  maintenance  sales and marketing  and client support services 
operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in compared to excluding goodwill amortization expense of million from the year ended december   operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or 
the decline in these expenses was mostly due to our restructuring plan that began at the end of the third quarter of  partially offset by the ramp up of new customer programs in europe in the third quarter of as a percentage of revenue  operating  selling and administrative expenses decreased from in  excluding goodwill amortization expense  to in asset impairment and restructuring expenses during  in connection with the restructuring plan announced in  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million associated with the write off of contact center operations and corporate support services identified in in  we announced a restructuring plan designed to intensify our focus on core competencies  accelerate revenue growth  and improve profitability 
the key components of the restructuring plan include several major organizational changes and the streamlining of contact center operations and corporate support services to improve effectiveness and drive revenue growth 
as part of our restructuring plan  we reduced fixed overhead to improve profitability by substantially completing the following by december  eliminating approximately operating  selling  and administrative positions globally  and reducing excess capacity by closing nine contact centers plus three administrative offices  and downsizing another five contact centers plus two administrative offices  resulting in the elimination of approximately  workstations 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million of asset impairment and restructuring charges  or million net of tax  related to the restructuring plan we announced in june as described above 
in the third quarter of  we recorded million of additional charges related to the plan 
operating income loss we had operating income of million in  compared to an operating loss of million in excluding the asset impairment and restructuring expenses in both years and goodwill amortization expense in  operating income increased million from million in to million in as a percentage of revenue  operating income was in compared to in this change resulted from all of the factors affecting revenue and expenses discussed earlier in this section 
interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was slightly lower in compared to equity in earnings loss of affiliates equity in earnings loss of affiliates represents our percentage share of the earnings loss from our investment in a joint venture in india 
as discussed previously  effective october   we revised our joint venture agreement and the results of our operations in certain latin america affiliates are now being accounted for under the equity method 
as a result  equity in earnings loss of affiliates increased by million in as compared to primarily due to us beginning to serve clients from the india facility in the third quarter of other expense  net other expense  net of other income  decreased million in compared to mostly because we recorded million of losses on disposals of certain assets recognized in income tax expense benefit we recorded income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in the income tax expense reflects a million deferred income tax expense we recorded in the fourth quarter to increase the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years related to an asia pacific subsidiary 
in  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes  minority interest and change in accounting method  excluding the charge in our deferred tax valuation allowance  was 
the difference between this rate and the statutory us federal rate of was primarily due to net operating losses in certain european and asia pacific subsidiaries for which no tax benefit was recognized and us state and local income taxes offset by lower international tax rates in certain jurisdictions 
the benefit reflects a million net deferred income tax benefit we recorded in the first quarter that resulted from an election to treat certain of our foreign operations as branches of our us company for us income tax purposes  and the million tax benefit we recorded on the asset impairment and restructuring charges and the losses on disposals of assets in the second quarter 
these benefits were offset by a million deferred income tax expense we recorded in the second quarter to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that were recorded in prior years related to our united kingdom subsidiaries 
financial condition and liquidity in this section  we discuss our financial condition and liquidity and the factors affecting them

please refer to this summary as you read our discussion of the sources and uses of cash in each year 
years ended december  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities in  cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million and a million increase in other liabilities  which were partially offset by a million increase in trade accounts receivable and million decrease in trade accounts payable 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment and used million to increase investments in affiliates 
this was partially offset by million of proceeds from dividends received from an equity method investee 
in  we received cash from financing activities mostly from million of net borrowings under our credit facility and million of net borrowings under other local lines of credit 
in  we used cash for financing activities to repay million of capital lease obligations 
in addition  we used cash to purchase a total of million of common stock under our existing stock purchase program 
in  cash provided by operating activities came from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million and a million decrease in trade accounts payable  which were partially offset by a million increase in trade accounts receivable and other assets 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment 
we received million from the sale of property and equipment associated with our joint ventures

in  cash provided by operating activities came from income before asset impairment and restructuring expenses  depreciation and amortization  and other charges of million and a million decrease in trade accounts receivable  which were partially offset by a million decrease in other liabilities 
although accounts receivable decreased during the period  we anticipate accounts receivable will increase as we continue to grow  which may require additional financing 
in  we used cash for investing activities mostly to purchase million of property and equipment  and we invested million in a joint venture in india 
in  we used cash for financing activities mostly to repay million of capital lease obligations 
capital resources we have historically used funds generated from operations  leases of property and equipment  senior subordinated notes  and borrowings under credit facilities with banks to finance business acquisitions  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
we have a three year million revolving credit facility which expires in december the credit facility is secured by accounts receivable in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
we intend to utilize the facility  as needed  for ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
at december   we had million of available borrowings under the credit facility  and we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the facility 
we expect to finance our current operations  planned capital expenditures  and internal growth for the foreseeable future using funds generated from operations  existing cash and available funds under our credit facility in addition to lease financing for property and equipment 
we estimate that our capital expenditures will range from million to million to cover technology upgrades  asset replacement and new business initiatives 
future acquisitions  if any  may require additional debt or equity financing 
under a stock repurchase program that was authorized by our board of directors in february  we may repurchase up to million of our shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on general business and market conditions 
through the date of this report  we had repurchased a total of  shares at a total cost of million 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations and commitments that are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we summarize our contractual obligations and commitments at december  in the following table year long term debt capital leases operating leases other debt total in thousands thereafter    total      other matters quarterly results and seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  quarterly variations in our results of operations mostly due to the timing of our clients customer relationship management initiatives and customer acquisition and loyalty campaigns  the commencement of new contracts and the discontinuance and termination of existing contracts  revenue mix  the timing of additional operating  selling  and administrative expenses to support new business  and the timing of recognition of incentive fees 
we experience periodic fluctuations in our results of operations related to both the start up costs associated with expansion and the implementation of clients crm activities 
in addition  our business generally tends to be slower in the third quarter due to summer holidays in europe 
effects of inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material effect on our operations in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to market risks associated primarily with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we have operations in many parts of the world  however  both revenue and expenses of those operations are typically denominated in the currency of the country of operations  providing a natural hedge 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars and can be impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations through both i translation risk  which is the risk that the financial statements for a particular period or as of a certain date depend on the prevailing exchange rates of the various currencies against the us dollar  and ii transaction risk  which is the risk that the functional currency of costs and liabilities fluctuates in relation to the currency of our revenue and assets  which fluctuation may adversely affect operating margins 
with respect to translation risk  even though the fluctuations of currencies against the us dollar can be substantial and therefore significantly impact comparisons with prior periods  the translation impact is recorded as a component of stockholders equity and does not affect the underlying results of operations 
gains and losses related to transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the countries in which we operate including short term intercompany accounts are included in the determination of net income loss 
interest rate risk we are also exposed to changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings 
interest rates on our senior subordinated notes and capital lease obligations are fixed  but rates on borrowings under our bank credit facility are variable 
during the years ended december   and  our average borrowings under our bank credit facility were million  million  and million  respectively 
based on our projected cash needs for the foreseeable future  we do not expect that our exposure to changes in interest rates for these borrowings will have a material impact on our interest expense
