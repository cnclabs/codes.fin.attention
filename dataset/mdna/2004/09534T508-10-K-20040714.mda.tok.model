overview blue coat systems  inc  also referred to in this report as we  us or the company  was incorporated in delaware on march  we are focused on the proxy appliance market 
blue coat high performance proxy appliances provide visibility and control of web communications to address today s new business risks such as inappropriate web surfing  viruses brought in via back door channels such as instant messaging and web based email  and network resource abuse due to peer to peer pp file sharing and video streaming 
our initial products  introduced in may of  utilized caching technology to improve user response time for accessing internet content 
these systems were used by service providers and enterprises throughout the world and achieved a market leadership position 
by  the caching market began evolving into two distinct markets enterprises looking for proxy caches to securely connect employees to the internet  and service providers looking for increased bandwidth savings and response time for their subscribers 
during this timeframe  service provider customers represented the majority of our revenues 
we continued  however  to enhance our competitive position in both markets through internal development and external acquisitions 
by early  the demand for extending our enterprise proxy caches started to grow  while the service provider market decreased significantly 
we accelerated our development and marketing efforts around our enterprise business  resulting in the launch of our proxysg products in february blue coat makes proxy appliances that provide organizations with visibility and control of web communications 
proxy appliances act as a middle man in between users on a network  and the internet 
proxy appliances do not replace existing perimeter security devices  rather  the appliances complement network firewalls by providing granular policy based controls over web traffic in ways that firewalls and other externally focused devices cannot 
the blue coat family of proxy appliances  called proxysg  are designed to address today s new business risks  which can include the risk to be sued by employees who witness inappropriate web surfing by their 
table of contents coworkers  viruses brought in via back door channels such as instant messaging and web based email  and network resource abuse due to peer to peer pp file sharing and video streaming 
the blue coat proxysg appliances  and new proxyav appliances for high performance web anti virus  are designed to enable organizations to minimize security risks and reduce the management costs and complexity of their web infrastructure 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  warranty costs  excess inventory and purchase commitments  investments  lease losses and restructuring accruals  intangible assets  goodwill impairment  income taxes and contingencies based on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences could be material 
we have discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe the accounting policies described below  among others  are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations revenue recognition and related receivable allowances  warranty costs  inventory  restructuring liabilities  valuation of intangible assets  goodwill impairment  income taxes  and contingencies 
revenue recognition and related receivable allowances 
we recognize appliance and winproxy revenue upon delivery of the product  assuming that evidence of an arrangement between the customer and us exists  the fee to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the sales price is probable  unless we have future obligations for installation or must obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until the obligations are met or acceptance is obtained 
revenues related to shipments to our distributors who have certain stock rotation rights are deferred until a point of sale report is received from the distributor confirming that our products have been sold to a reseller or an end user 
maintenance contract revenue is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract  which is usually to months 
delivery is considered to have occurred for our appliances when the customer takes title to the product and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
winproxy software delivery is considered to have occurred upon delivery of the software key 
delivery of the winproxy software key is typically made electronically 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
our customers are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay for our products and services 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process  revenue is not recognized until cash receipt 
during the course of the three months and years ended april  and  we deferred certain revenue based on this criteria and revenue from certain customers was recognized based upon cash receipts 

table of contents we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer solvency  current economic and geographic trends  and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of such allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as sales of products that include maintenance  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
relative fair value for maintenance elements are determined based on substantive renewal rates 
if we have arrangements that include performance  cancellation or refund type provisions  then revenue is deferred until all obligations have been met 
warranty costs 
we accrue for warranty expenses at the time revenue is recognized and maintain an accrual for estimated future warranty obligations based upon the relationship between historical and anticipated costs and sales volumes 
if actual warranty expenses are greater than those projected  additional reserves and other charges against earnings may be required 
if actual warranty expenses are less than projected  prior reserves could be reduced providing a positive impact on our reported results 
inventory 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method  after appropriate consideration has been given to inventory that is obsolete  or in excess of anticipated future demand 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments  and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write offs and other charges against earnings may be required 
restructuring liabilities 
we have accrued various restructuring liabilities  through charges to restructuring expenses  related to employee severance costs  facilities closure and lease abandonment costs  and contract termination costs in our consolidated financial statements 
our restructuring liabilities for facilities closure and lease abandonment costs include various assumptions  such as the time period over which abandoned facilities will be vacant  expected sublease terms  and expected sublease rates 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial change to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates 
these conditions may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease the facilities  sublease terms  sublease rates  and lease termination 
valuation of intangible assets 
we evaluate our long lived and intangible assets other than goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment and identifiable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for its business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
goodwill impairment 
we perform goodwill impairment tests in our fourth quarter annually and more often if indicators of impairment are present 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
for the purposes of our fiscal annual impairment test  we considered our market capitalization on the date of our impairment test and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 

table of contents income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes as required by the fasb sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
contingencies 
from time to time we are involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
if management believes that a loss arising from these matters is probable and can reasonably be estimated  we record the amount of the loss  or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point within the range is more probable than any other 
as additional information becomes available  any potential liability related to these matters is assessed and the estimates are revised  if necessary 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could result in a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which the ruling occurs  or future periods 
results of operations net sales 
the following is a summary of net sales and the changes in net sales by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  total net sales change from prior year change from prior year at the beginning of fiscal  we introduced our proxysg product line which marked a significant change in our focus from selling caching appliances to service providers to selling proxy appliances to enterprises 
for all of fiscal we invested significant effort in establishing our new products in the marketplace 
by the start of fiscal  we had made significant progress in our efforts and net sales began to increase in the first half of fiscal and increased more significantly in the second half of fiscal by the end of fiscal  we no longer sold our caching appliances 
the increase in net sales from fiscal to fiscal was largely the result of an increase in unit sales as our proxysg appliances began to achieve acceptance in the market through our continued efforts to establish market presence and distribution channels 
net sales increased slightly in the first half of the fiscal year  but increased more significantly in the second half 
this increase in the second half was coincident with the release of the second generation of proxysg products in september of  and benefited from an overall market increase in it spending during the fourth calendar quarter of the increased level of demand for our products experienced in our fiscal third quarter ended january  continued through our fiscal fourth quarter ended april  as a result of our focus on increasing the use of indirect distribution channels  one of our distributors accounted for and of our net sales during the years ended april  and  respectively 
no customer accounted for more than of our net sales during the year ended april  the same distributor accounted for and of our gross accounts receivable at april  and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our gross accounts receivable at april  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales from fiscal to fiscal was largely the result of a decrease in unit sales of the company s caching appliances  due to the significant reduction in spending by service providers 
the growth in sales of the company s proxysg product line introduced at the beginning of fiscal was not sufficient to 
table of contents offset the decrease in unit sales of its caching appliance product line 
in addition  enterprise customers tended to purchase lower end systems  which have lower average sales prices than our higher end systems typically purchased by service providers 
the reduction in product sales was partially offset by increased service revenue 
the following is a summary of net sales by product category in thousands year ended april  appliances web security legacy total appliance service winproxy total net sales appliance sales increased by from fiscal to fiscal  largely as a result of the increase in the number of proxysg appliances sold in fiscal  more than making up for the continued decrease in sales of our legacy caching appliances 
appliance sales decreased by from fiscal to fiscal this decrease was largely the result of the decline in sales of our caching appliances  only partially offset by the introduction of our proxysg product line in the beginning of fiscal our service net sales increased from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal the net sales increases in absolute dollars were due to a larger installed base of our proxysg appliances each year  as customers purchase new support contracts with their new proxysg appliance purchases and renewed maintenance contracts on existing proxysg appliances 
in november of  we purchased ositis software inc  a developer of web security and internet access technologies 
ositis products include winproxy  an internet sharing solution  which we have broken out as a separate product category in our net sales 
the following is a summary of net sales by geographic area in thousands year ended april  north america emea asia total net sales net sales for north america increased from fiscal to fiscal  based on the increased net sales of the proxysg product line 
we focused the majority of our marketing efforts for proxysg in north america and europe  middle east  and africa emea  based on our belief that potential customers in north america and emea were the most likely to require the enhanced features and functionality of the proxysg product line 
net sales in north america decreased by from fiscal to fiscal  largely due to the reduction in spending from our service providers and the purchase of lower end systems from our enterprise customers 
net sales for emea increased from fiscal to fiscal based on the increased net sales of the proxysg product line 
net sales in emea increased by from fiscal to fiscal we did not invest in building up the emea market as much as we focused on north america and asia prior to fiscal however  similar to north america  we focused our proxysg marketing efforts in emea starting in fiscal 
table of contents net sales for asia increased from fiscal to fiscal as demand for the new proxysg product line improved for asia  but to a lesser extent than in north america or emea 
net sales in asia decreased by from fiscal to fiscal the asia region was the most dependent on the sales of caching appliances to service providers  and as this market declined in fiscal our net sales in that region were significantly impacted 
in fiscal we instituted stronger credit requirements for much of our asia region in response to growing concerns over our asian customer s creditworthiness  which impacted our net sales from that portion of the world 
in addition  our sales force in asia in fiscal and fiscal was not as large as it was in fiscal gross profit 
the following is a summary of gross profit by fiscal year in thousands year ended april gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher net sales while total manufacturing and support costs increased slightly but not proportionate to net sales 
gross profit as a percent of net sales increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of i cost efficiencies associated with increased business volume  and ii lower component costs gross profit decreased slightly during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower net sales  partially offset by significant reductions in total costs of goods sold 
cost of goods sold in fiscal included excess and obsolete inventory charges of approximately million 
in addition  costs of goods sold in fiscal were lower due to significantly lower fixed manufacturing and support costs as a result of restructuring programs initiated in prior fiscal years 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the factors mentioned above  as well as a significant reduction in manufacturing and support costs 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  fluctuations in demand for our products  the timing and size of customer orders and product implementations  the mix of direct and indirect sales  the mix and average selling prices of products  new product introductions and enhancements  component costs  manufacturing costs and product configuration 
if actual orders do not match our forecasts  as we have experienced in the past  we may have excess or inadequate inventory of some materials and components or we could incur cancellation charges or penalties  which would increase our costs or prevent or delay product shipments and could seriously harm our business 
lead times of certain components have increased due to increases in it spending and the economic recovery 
research and development 
the following is a summary of research and development expenses by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  research and development r d as a percentage of net sales research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and prototype and testing equipment costs 
research and development headcount was at april   at april   and at april  during february of we implemented a reduction in workforce of approximately employees across all departments 
as a result the headcount number as of april  is not reflective of the 
table of contents true number of employees within the research and development department during the fiscal year ended april  the actual headcount during the year was higher  which explains the significant reduction in total research and development expense from fiscal to fiscal research and development expenses increased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily attributable to an increase in staffing in the third quarter due to the ositis software inc acquisition and non recurring engineering charges associated with the launch of our proxysg and series 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal occurred due to an increase in total net sales with only a slight increase in absolute dollars of total research and development expense 
the decrease in research and development expenses from fiscal to fiscal in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to significantly lower staffing levels throughout as compared to fiscal the decrease in research and development headcount at april   is a result of the restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal additionally  in fiscal  we received million in credits for fiscal and scientific research and experimental development expenditures related to our research and development office in canada  which were recorded as a reduction of research and development expense 
we believe that continued investment in product enhancement and new product development is critical to achieving our strategic objectives  and as a result  as our net sales allow  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
however  should sales decline in future periods  we may implement cost reduction programs to reduce our research and development expenses 
sales and marketing 
the following is a summary of sales and marketing expenses by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  sales and marketing sales and marketing as a percentage of net sales sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  travel  advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing headcount was at april   at april  and at april  sales and marketing expense decreased slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal even with an increase in headcount due to decreased marketing expenditures 
sales and marketing expense decreased in fiscal  compared to fiscal due to reductions in sales and marketing headcount as a result of the restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was attributable to the increase in total net sales  without a proportionate increase to sales and marketing expense 
our sales organization was able to achieve much higher levels of productivity largely due to the success of the proxysg product line 
the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal occurred because of lower sales and expenses that did not decrease in proportion to sales 
should growth in demand for our products continue  we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in an effort to expand domestic and international markets  introduce new products and establish and expand new distribution channels 
however  should sales decline in future periods  we may implement cost reduction programs to reduce our sales and marketing expenses 

table of contents general and administrative 
the following is a summary of general and administrative expenses by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  general and administrative expense general and administrative as a percentage of net sales general and administrative headcount was at april  at april  and at april  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to increased headcount 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars during fiscal compared to fiscal was largely related to the restructuring plan implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was due to the increase in net revenues for the year as the spending in general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was a result of the significantly lower expenses in resulting from the restructuring plan implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal should growth in demand for our products continue  we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we increase headcount to manage expanding operations and facilities and to appropriately respond to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
however  should sales decline in future periods  we may implement cost reduction programs to reduce our general and administrative expenses 
legal settlement fees on august   network caching technology llc nct filed suit against us and others in the united states district court for the northern district of california  alleging infringement of certain patents owned by nct 
the lawsuit was styled network caching technology llc vs 
novell  inc et al  case no 
cv on october   blue coat and nct entered into a settlement agreement by which blue coat received a fully paid up license under the nct patents for all blue coat products and services and a full and complete release from any and all claims of liability for any actual or alleged past and present infringement of the nct patents 
as consideration for the license rights and release  we paid a total of million expensed as a separate line item on our statement of operations named legal settlement fees 
the order of dismissal regarding all causes of action between nct and blue coat was entered november  stock compensation 
the following summarizes stock compensation expense by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  stock compensation expense stock compensation as a percentage of net sales as a result of the acquisition of ositis november   deferred stock compensation of million was included in our shareholders equity on the balance sheet 
of this million  million was amortized to stock compensation expense in our statement of operations during the year ended april  in addition  stock compensation expense reflects the amortization of deferred stock compensation  charges associated with stock options and warrants granted to non employees for services and modifications to stock based awards for certain departed employees 

table of contents stock compensation expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of decreased headcount and decreased amortization of deferred stock compensation for remaining employees  partially offset in fiscal by an increase in expense due to stock awards committed to be issued to ositis software employees who became our employees after the acquisition 
our policy is to amortize ositis related deferred stock compensation using a straight line method 
deferred stock compensation recorded in connection with our november initial public offering  certain below market option grants in fiscal and unvested options assumed in our december acquisition of entera are amortized using a graded method 
graded amortization methods result in greater amortization in earlier years 
based on committed stock awards  and the options granted through april   we have a remaining balance of approximately million in deferred stock compensation 
this amount will be fully amortized during fiscal stock compensation expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the amortization of the deferred compensation balances recorded in our statement of shareholders equity 
the deferred compensation balance in our equity statement during fiscal and was being amortized using the graded vesting method  which results in greater amortization in earlier years 
thus a significant amount of our deferred compensation was amortized in fiscal while a lesser amount was amortized in fiscal goodwill amortization 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we ceased amortizing goodwill at the end of fiscal and have not amortized goodwill for any acquisitions subsequent to fiscal in fiscal  we amortized goodwill by million 
the goodwill that was amortized during fiscal related to the acquisition of entera during fiscal acquired in process technology 
we recorded a non recurring  non cash  charge in fiscal for the value of in process technology acquired in the ositis acquisition  which relates to in process technology that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future use in our development activities 
no such charges were recorded in fiscal years or to establish the value of the in process technology acquired from ositis  we used an income approach  which values an asset based on the earnings capacity of such asset considering the future cash flows that could potentially be generated by the asset over its estimated remaining life 
these cash flows were discounted to their present value using a discount rate of  theoretically equal to a rate that would provide sufficient return to a potential investor at an appropriate level of risk 
the present value of the cash flows over the life of the asset is summed to equal the estimated value of the asset 
impairment of assets 
as discussed further under asset impairment below  and in item  note impairment of assets of consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  in fiscal we performed impairment assessments of our long lived assets and determined that enterprise level goodwill associated with the springbank and entera acquisitions was impaired 
as a result  an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal to write the net book value of our enterprise level goodwill down to zero 
additionally  we recorded write downs related primarily to certain leasehold improvements of million in fiscal the leasehold improvement write downs related to certain research and development facilities  which were closed and or relocated in fiscal in connection with our restructuring and reorganization activities 
we recorded no write downs of long lived assets during the years ended april  and

the following summarizes restructuring expense and changes in restructuring expense by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  restructuring expense change in restructuring expense change in restructuring expense as discussed further under restructuring plans below  and in note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we recorded million  million  and million in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively  related to facilities closure costs  lease abandonment costs  certain employee severance costs and contract termination costs 
we revised certain of our estimates related to lease termination costs and recorded million of restructuring charges in fiscal see note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
interest and other income expense 
the following summarizes interest and other income expense and changes in interest and other income expense by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  interest income other income expense change in interest income change in other income expense interest income decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal these decreases were primarily attributable to lower interest bearing cash and investment balances as well as lower interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
other income consists primarily of realized gains and losses on investments  foreign exchange gain or losses  banking fees  other than temporary impairment on investments  and non recurring gains or losses not in our normal course of business 
other income increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and other income for fiscal primarily reflected our recovery on a previously reserved employee note that was collected during the fourth quarter of during fiscal certain investments that we held were deemed to be more than temporarily impaired and were written off 
as a result of this write down in fiscal  other expense was considerably higher than in fiscal 
table of contents provision for income taxes 
the following summarizes the provision for income taxes and changes in the provision for income taxes by fiscal year in thousands year ended april  provision for income taxes change in provision for income taxes change in provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes  which is composed entirely of foreign corporate income taxes  decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  and from  in fiscal the foreign corporate income taxes result from our international expansion and the establishment of branches and subsidiaries in various jurisdictions 
we have incurred losses from our inception through april  management believes that  based on the history of such losses and other factors  the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
therefore  a full valuation allowance has been recorded at april  and the valuation allowance increased decreased by million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of april   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in fiscal years ending in through  if not utilized 
we also had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in fiscal years ending in through  if not utilized 
we also had federal and california research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which will expire in fiscal years through  if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
the events that may cause ownership changes in our net operating loss include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than over a three year period 
we are currently undergoing an analysis of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in order to determine the total amount of carryforwards  which we will be able to use in future periods 
our deferred tax assets  which have been offset by the valuation allowance  include deferred tax benefits associated with employee incentive stock options 
these deferred tax benefits of approximately million will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
federal and state income taxes have not been provided on accumulated but undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately million at april   as such earnings have been reinvested in the business 
if such earnings were not permanently reinvested  a deferred tax liability of  would have been required 
acquisitions ositis software  inc on november   we completed an acquisition of ositis software  inc ositis 
the purchase price of million consisted of million shares of blue coat common stock valued at million  million in cash and million in direct transaction costs 
the total purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
see note acquisitions of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion

for further discussion regarding goodwill  refer to the asset impairment section below 
stock compensation we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million for the year ended april  related to stock  which will be issued to ositis employees who transferred to our company and became blue coat employees 
we did not record any deferred stock compensation in fiscal or our deferred stock compensation expense results from a variety of stock based transactions 
increases to our deferred stock compensation balance represents the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying stock on the date of stock options that are granted to employees 
however  we have also completed other stock based transactions that impact deferred stock compensation  such as acquisitions in which the outstanding options of the acquired entity are assumed  instances where modifications are made to the terms and conditions of option grants subsequent to the grant date  and acquisitions where we have committed to issuing stock option awards to transitioned employees 
deferred stock compensation is amortized to stock compensation expense over the option vesting period  generally two to four years  recognized immediately if there is no vesting period  or recognized over the term that the award is earned 
in addition to amortization of deferred stock compensation  stock compensation expense includes charges associated with stock options and warrants granted to non employees for services 
we recorded stock compensation expense of approximately million  million and million for the years ended april   and  respectively 
we may record additional deferred stock compensation and or stock compensation expense in the future if management decides to grant stock options with exercise prices lower than fair market value of the stock  assume outstanding options in future acquisitions  issue stock awards in future acquisitions  modify outstanding stock awards subsequent to their date of grant  or enter into other transactions that may require the recognition of additional compensation 
we expect stock compensation expense  to impact our reported results through fiscal 
table of contents restructuring plans in february  our board of directors approved a restructuring program to significantly reduce operating expenses and to further align the company with market conditions  future revenue expectations and planned future product direction 
in connection with this restructuring program  we implemented a reduction in workforce of approximately employees  which represented approximately of our workforce 
we accrued million in the fourth quarter ended april   comprised of employee severance costs of million  facilities closure and lease abandonment costs of million and contract termination costs of million 
all employees were notified of their termination prior to april  estimates related to sublease costs and income were based on assumptions regarding sublease rates and the time required to locate sub lessees  which were derived from market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and to the extent that these assumptions materially change due to changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expense for the abandoned facilities is adjusted 
in july  one of our facilities in sunnyvale  california was subleased for the remainder of the lease term at a rental price that was consistent with initial estimates 
our facility in redmond  washington was subleased in december  for the remainder of the term of the original lease at a rental price consistent with initial estimates 
due to its financial difficulties  the tenant in sunnyvale  california surrendered the premises and vacated the property in january the facility in sunnyvale  california is again vacant and available for subleasing 
as a result  we revised and increased the restructuring accruals for abandoned space by million during fiscal based on new market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 
we also reduced our estimates for contract termination costs by million during fiscal  as we were able to negotiate lower settlement amounts than originally estimated 
during the second and fourth quarter of fiscal  we further increased our restructuring accruals for abandoned space by million to reflect additional revisions of market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 
as of april   all severance costs related to domestic and international employees had been paid and million remained accrued for lease abandonment and contract termination costs 
the lease abandonment costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through fiscal in august  our board of directors approved a restructuring program in response to the continued economic slowdown that negatively impacted first quarter of fiscal demand for our products as potential customers deferred spending on internet and intranet infrastructure 
in order to streamline our cost structure and better position us for planned growth  we implemented a reduction in workforce of approximately positions 
we incurred million in restructuring costs in the quarter ended october   which included employee severance costs of million and certain contract termination costs of million 
as of april   these severance payments and contract termination payments were completed 
in february  we announced a reorganization plan and incurred million in reorganization costs in the quarter ended april  to complete this effort  which primarily included employee severance costs of million to reduce our workforce by employees and certain contract termination costs of million 
this plan was instituted in response to an unanticipated economic slowdown that negatively impacted third and fourth quarter fiscal demand for our products  as potential customers deferred spending on internet and intranet infrastructure 
the reorganization plan was designed to more closely align spending with our sales projections 
as of april   these severance payments and contract termination payments were completed

in addition  anticipated savings from the reduced headcount or facility consolidations have been  and may in the future be  mitigated by changes in circumstances or subsequent increases in headcount and facilities related to our operating requirements 
see note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
asset impairment in fiscal  we determined that certain enterprise level goodwill recorded in connection with our springbank and entera acquisitions was not fully recoverable 
our impairment assessments were performed because i our stock price had declined significantly and the net book value of our assets significantly exceeded our market capitalization and ii industry growth rates had declined significantly 
the overall decline in industry growth rates indicated that this trend might continue for an indefinite period 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal to reduce goodwill to its estimated fair value based on the market value method 
the estimate of fair value was based upon our average market capitalization  which was calculated using our average closing stock price surrounding each respective measurement date 
additionally  we recorded a write down related primarily to certain leasehold improvements of million in fiscal the leasehold improvement write down related to certain research and development facilities  which were closed and or relocated in fiscal in connection with our restructuring and reorganization activities

working capital uses of cash included increases in prepaid expenses and other current assets  an increase in our accounts receivable balance  and a decrease in accrued liabilities 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased over levels as a result of certain committed orders with certain vendors to obtain discounted prices on essential product as well as purchases of material used for new product introductions  which were designated as prepaid amounts 
accounts receivable increased as a result of increased sales during fiscal as compared to fiscal  partially offset by increased collection efforts 
our day s sales outstanding have decreased from at april  to at april  accrued liabilities decreased over the prior year primarily as a result of cash payments made against the restructuring accrual recorded during fiscal  offset by a slight increase in accrued payroll 
working capital sources of cash included an increase in accounts payable and an increase in deferred revenue

contractual obligations below is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases abandoned space in use total purchase commitments total purchase commitments are principally for manufacturing material and equipment 
we lease certain equipment and office facilities under noncancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through the facility leases generally require us to pay operating costs  including property taxes  insurance and maintenance  and contain scheduled rent increases and certain other rent escalation clauses 
rent expense is reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
for purposes of the above table  contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable  legally binding on us  and subject us to penalties if we cancel the agreement 
our purchase commitments are based on our short term manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
based on our current plan  we expect to generate cash flow from operations in the fiscal year ending april  our long term strategy is to maintain a minimum amount of cash and cash equivalents for operational purposes and to invest the remaining amount of our cash in interest bearing and highly liquid cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
as of april   we had a total of million in cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as million in restricted investments  providing us with a total cash position of million 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as of april  and cash generated from operations  if any  will provide sufficient capital to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  should prevailing economic conditions and or financial  business and other factors beyond our control adversely affect our estimates of our future cash requirements  or if cash is used for unanticipated purposes  we may need additional capital sooner than expected 
although we cannot guarantee that planned results will be obtained in fiscal or that sufficient debt or equity capital will be available to us under acceptable terms  if at all  we believe that our planned cash flow assumptions can be realized 
however  if 
table of contents we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  we could be unable to continue our operations 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities  nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to certain market risks  including changes in exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposures to exchange and interest rate risks  and we are not a party to any risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of april   we had approximately million invested primarily in certificates of deposit and fixed rate  short term corporate and us government debt securities 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which is intended to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we develop products in the united states and sell them throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since all of our sales are currently made in united states dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a significant portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of north america 
in contrast  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  we do not consider the market risk associated with our international operations to be material 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes
