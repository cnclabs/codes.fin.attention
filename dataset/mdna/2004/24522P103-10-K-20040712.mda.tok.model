the industry overall 
the united states processed food industry is generally characterized by relatively stable growth based on modest price and population increases 
we believe that the long term fundamentals for the overall packaged food industry are favorable since these products are generally considered to be staple items for consumers to purchase 
while consumption growth is predicted to be modest in the united states  we believe that certain product categories that address changing consumer needs  such as tuna pouch  premium fruit  diced tomatoes  private label soup  broth  dry pet foods and pet snacks offer opportunities for faster growth 
we face substantial competition throughout our product lines from numerous well established businesses operating nationally or regionally with single or multiple branded product lines 
we also face competition from private label manufacturers that compete for consumer preference  distribution  shelf space and merchandising support 
in addition  we also compete directly against other private label manufacturers with our private label products  primarily soup 
in general  we compete on the basis of quality  breadth of product line  brand awareness  price  taste  nutrition  packaging  variety  convenience and value added services such as inventory management 
a number 
table of contents of our competitors have broader product lines and substantially greater financial and other resources available to them 
food producers have been impacted by two key trends affecting their retail customers consolidation and increased competitive pressures 
retailers are rationalizing costs in an effort to improve profitability  including efforts to reduce inventory levels  increase supply chain efficiency and decrease working capital requirements 
in addition  more traditional grocers have experienced increasing competition from rapidly growing club stores  supercenters and mass merchandisers  which generally offer every day low prices 
retailer customers generally offer a private label store brand in addition to offering the number one and number two national or regional brands in different product categories 
sustaining strong relationships with retailers has become a critical success factor for food companies and is driving initiatives such as category and inventory management 
food companies that offer such value added services have been able to increase shelf space  maximize distribution efficiencies  further strengthen their relationships with retailers and maintain their leadership positions 
the market data referred to below excludes sales to certain mass merchandisers 
overall  recent sales in the retail grocery channel have been declining  partially due to a shift in sales away from traditional grocery channels towards mass merchandisers

under various statutes and regulations  these agencies prescribe requirements and establish standards for safety  purity  performance and labeling 
our products must comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including food and drug laws  of the jurisdictions in which they are manufactured and marketed  such as the federal food  drug and cosmetic act of  as amended  and the federal fair packaging and labeling act of  as amended 
in addition  advertising of our products is subject to regulation by the ftc  and our operations are subject to certain health and safety regulations  including those issued under the occupational safety and health act 
our manufacturing facilities and products are subject to periodic inspection by federal  state and local authorities 
we seek to comply at all times with all such laws and regulations and to obtain any necessary permits and licenses 
we believe our facilities and practices are sufficient to maintain material compliance with current applicable governmental laws  regulations  permits and licenses 
nevertheless  we cannot guarantee that we are currently in compliance with all applicable laws  regulations  or requirements for permits or licenses nor that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or requirements for necessary permits and licenses 
our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or obtain any necessary permits and licenses could subject us to civil remedies including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions 
as a result of our agricultural  food processing and canning activities  we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations govern the treatment  handling  storage and disposal of materials and waste and the remediation of contaminated properties 
violations or non compliance with these laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines or civil liability against us by governmental entities or private parties 
we seek to comply at all times with these laws and regulations 
outside the united states  we are also subject to applicable multi national  national and local environmental laws and regulations in the host countries where we do business 
we have programs across our international business units designed to meet compliance with requirements in the environmental area 
however  we cannot predict the extent to which the enforcement of any existing or future environmental law or regulation may affect our operations 
among the environmental matters currently affecting us are the following we assumed the defense of an action brought by the public media center in the superior court in san francisco  ca  on december  pursuant to the separation agreement 
the plaintiff alleged violations of california health safety code sections  et seq commonly known as proposition and california s unfair competition law for alleged failure to properly warn consumers of the presence of methylmercury in canned tuna 
the plaintiff filed this suit against the three major producers of canned tuna in the us  including our company 
the plaintiff seeks civil penalties of two thousand five hundred dollars per day and a permanent injunction against the defendants from offering canned tuna for sale in california without providing clear and reasonable warnings of the presence of methylmercury 
we dispute the plaintiff s allegations 
we cannot at this time reasonably estimate a range of exposure  if any  of our potential liability 
the california attorney general brought an action in the superior court in san francisco  california  on june  the attorney general alleged violations of california health safety code sections  et seq commonly known as proposition and california s unfair competition law for alleged failure to properly warn consumers of the presence of methylmercury in canned tuna 
the attorney general filed this suit against the three major producers of canned tuna in the us  including del monte 
the attorney 
table of contents general seeks civil penalties of two thousand five hundred dollars per day and a permanent injunction against the defendants from offering canned tuna for sale in california without providing clear and reasonable warnings of the presence of methylmercury 
we dispute the attorney general s allegations 
we cannot at this time reasonably estimate a range of exposure  if any  of our potential liability 
on september   the allegheny county health department achd issued a notice of violation alleging violations of rules governing air emissions from the power plant at our pittsburgh  pa facility 
the alleged violations occurred prior to our acquisition of this facility in december the achd threatened to impose civil fines and penalties of up to million 
the power plant is operated by a third party operator under contract with us 
we expect to be indemnified by the third party operator for a portion of any fines or penalties ultimately imposed 
we dispute the allegations 
we believe we have accrued adequate reserves to cover any material liability that may result from these proceedings 
we are conducting groundwater remediation at our stockton  ca property associated with petroleum hydrocarbon contamination that resulted from the operations of a prior owner of the property 
we are remediating the contamination at the site 
we believe that we have accrued adequate reserves to cover any material liability that may result from this contamination 
after consultation with governmental authorities  we have selected and begun implementation of a remedial alternative 
at the present time  we are unable to predict the total cost for the remediation 
further  investigation and remediation of environmental conditions may be required in the future at other properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us 
nonetheless  based on current information  we do not expect that the costs associated with the stockton  ca remediation or any other potential future remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
governmental authorities and private claimants have notified us that we may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at certain contaminated sites  including certain third party sites at which we disposed of wastes 
we may be liable for remediation costs at these sites as a result of alleged leaks  spills  releases or disposal of certain wastes or other substances at these sites 
with respect to a majority of these sites  we have settled our liability 
based upon the information currently available  we do not expect that our liability for the remaining sites will be material 
we may receive additional claims that we are potentially liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at other sites in the future 
we expect to perform soil and groundwater investigation and remediation at our terminal island  ca property as part of the closure and demolition of a facility  which was operated by a joint venture to which starkist was a party 
we assumed this liability pursuant to the merger agreement 
we are in an early stage of consultation with the port of los angeles  which owns the property where this facility was located  regarding the nature and scope of the investigation and remediation to be performed 
at the present time  we are unable to predict the total cost for the investigation and remediation 
based on current information  we believe that we have accrued adequate reserves to cover any material liability that may result from this investigation and remediation 
we do not expect that the costs associated with this investigation and remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
our environmental expenditures in recent years have related to wastewater treatment systems  settlement of environmental litigation and underground storage tank ust remediation activities 
we project that we will spend approximately million in fiscal on capital projects and other expenditures in connection with environmental compliance for our existing businesses  primarily for boiler upgrades  compliance costs related to the consolidation of our fruit and tomato processing 
table of contents operations and continued ust remediation activities 
we believe that our environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the marine mammal protection act of and the regulations under this act  regulate the incidental taking of dolphins in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean 
this is where a portion of our light meat tuna  including yellowfin  is currently caught 
in  the starkist seafood business voluntarily adopted a worldwide policy not to purchase tuna caught in the eastern tropical pacific ocean through the intentional encirclement of dolphin by purse seine nets and reaffirmed its policy not to purchase tuna caught anywhere using gill nets or drift nets 
also in  the dolphin protection consumer information act was enacted regulating the labeling of tuna products as dolphin safe and bans the importation of tuna caught using high seas drift nets 
the marine mammal protection act was amended in to further regulate tuna fishing methods that involve marine mammals 
compliance with these laws and regulations and starkist seafood s voluntary policy has not had  and is not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
in  congress passed the international dolphin conservation program act  which modified the regulation of the incidental taking of dolphins in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean and revised the definition of dolphin safe 
despite the passage of the less restrictive international dolphin conservation program act  we remain committed to the more dolphin friendly standards of the marine mammal protection act 
revision of the definition of dolphin safe and modification of the regulation of the incidental taking of dolphins in the course of fishing for yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical pacific ocean have not had  and management does not expect them to have  a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
seasonality  working capital our historical net sales have exhibited seasonality  with the first fiscal quarter typically having the lowest net sales 
lower levels of promotional activity  the availability of fresh produce and other factors have historically affected net sales in the first quarter 
we have experienced increased sales of our fruit  vegetable  tomato and broth products during the holiday and back to school periods in the united states  extending from september through december  as well as sales associated with the easter holiday 
we have also experienced increases in pet snacks sales during the year end holiday period 
our soup products sales typically peak during the winter months 
sales of our tuna products are usually higher during the period after new year s day through the easter holiday 
we typically schedule promotional events to coincide with these periods of increased product consumption 
we use cash from operations in addition to our revolving line of credit to fund our working capital needs 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future based upon a number of factors 
our working capital requirements are seasonally affected by the growing cycle of some of the products we process 
our inventory position for these products is also seasonally affected by this growing cycle 
the vast majority of del monte brands inventories are produced during the harvesting and packing months of june through october and depleted through the remaining seven months 
accordingly  the majority of our cash flow is generated in our third and fourth quarter as we sell inventory that was produced primarily in the first and second quarters 
this seasonality factor also has an effect  but to a lesser extent  upon our results of operations 
soup  infant feeding  tuna and pet products are produced throughout the year 
prior to the merger  heinz performed the cash management function for the acquired businesses  including sweeps of available cash held in excess of obligations 
these transactions are shown as net parent settlements in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods prior to december  
table of contents employees we employ approximately  full time employees in the us and abroad 
in addition  temporary seasonal workers are hired during the del monte brands pack season  typically june through october  adding approximately  seasonal employees to our workforce during those months 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
we have collective bargaining agreements with union locals covering approximately of our hourly full time and seasonal employees 
of these employees  approximately are covered under two collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in fiscal  and approximately are covered under collective bargaining agreements scheduled to expire in fiscal these agreements are subject to negotiation and renewal 
failure to renew any of these collective bargaining agreements could result in a strike or work stoppage that could materially adversely affect our operations

table of contents factors that may affect our future results and stock price we are subject to many risks and uncertainties that may affect our future financial performance and our stock price 
some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our financial performance to vary or that may materially or adversely affect our financial performance or stock price are discussed below 
the commodities  ingredients and raw materials that we require are subject to price increases and shortages that could adversely affect our profitability 
we may be unable to effectively pass increased costs along to our customers 
the primary commodities  ingredients and other raw materials that we use include steel  fruits  vegetables  tomatoes  tuna  grains  sugar  spices  meats  meat by products  soybean meal  dairy products  fats  oils  chemicals and energy 
prices for these materials may be volatile and we may experience shortages in these materials as a result of external conditions  commodity market fluctuations  availability  currency fluctuations  governmental regulations  including import restrictions  agricultural programs or issues  and other factors outside our control 
more specifically  the price and availability of steel is subject to factors outside our control  such as increased demand from other users  import restrictions  government regulations  and competition among  and the financial condition of  steel suppliers 
other commodities  such as grain including corn and wheat  meat by products  soybean meal  fuel and natural gas are also subject to similar influences 
severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters  such as floods  droughts  frosts  disease  earthquakes and the ocean temperature effect known as el ni o  may also affect the cost and supply of commodities  ingredients and raw materials  particularly raw materials such as fruits  vegetables  tomatoes  grain  sugar and spices 
weather patterns may also affect fish availability 
in addition  some scientists believe that the population of some larger fish species has been depleted due to over fishing  potentially affecting the current and future supply of tuna 
commodity  ingredient and raw material price increases or shortages may result in higher costs or interrupt our production schedules  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
production delays could lead to reduced sales volumes and profitability as well as loss of market share 
increasing our prices to offset higher costs may also result in reduced sales volume and profitability 
if we increase our prices  we may need to increase marketing spending  including trade promotion spending  in order to retain our market share 
increased marketing costs may significantly offset the benefits of any price increase 
if we are not able to effectively pass commodity  ingredient and other raw material price increases along to our customers  our operating income will decrease 
our competitors may be better able than we are to effect price increases or to otherwise pass along cost increases to their customers 
if commodity  ingredient and other raw material costs remain at their current high levels  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we are currently experiencing high prices for some of the commodities  ingredients and other raw materials we use 
we generally use commodity futures and options to reduce the price volatility associated with anticipated commodity purchases of corn  wheat  soybean meal and soybean oil used in the production of certain of our products 
hedging practices do not eliminate the risk of increased costs as a result of commodity price increases 
the extent of our future commodities requirements that we hedge at any given time depends on our assessment of the markets for these commodities we use  including our assumptions about future prices for such commodities 
for example  if we believe market prices for the commodities we use are unusually high  we may choose to hedge less  or even none  of our upcoming requirements 

table of contents the prices of commodities that we have traditionally hedged recently have increased substantially 
due to the current high prices  we have elected to hedge significantly less of our requirements of these items for fiscal than we typically have hedged at this time during other fiscal years 
other commodities  ingredients and raw materials are not covered by our hedging program 
fuel prices affect our transportation costs for both raw materials and finished product 
natural gas prices also affect our production costs 
fuel and natural gas prices are currently high 
we are also currently experiencing high prices for steel  fats  oils  chemicals  and tuna  particularly albacore  which further affects our costs 
if our assessments and assumptions about commodity prices  as well as ingredient and other raw material prices  prove to be incorrect  our costs may be greater than anticipated 
if we are not able to effectively pass cost increases along to our customers  our operating income will decrease and our operating results would be adversely impacted 
current shortages of steel and the related increase in steel prices could materially adversely affect our results of operations  the impact of these shortages and price increases may be comparatively greater on us in light of the bankruptcy of weirton steel 
we are currently experiencing increased steel costs and steel shortages and may experience increased costs above current expectations or additional steel shortages 
impress  one of our primary suppliers of cans and ends  contracted with weirton steel for a substantial portion of the steel impress requires in order to produce cans and ends for us 
because of the bankruptcy of weirton steel and the subsequent sale of substantially all of its assets  impress will be required to renegotiate its contract  which was not assigned to the purchaser of the weirton assets  with the purchaser of these assets or source steel from other suppliers 
impress may not be able to secure the steel it needs on terms comparable to its original contract with weirton  if at all 
if the price that impress must pay for steel increases above current expectations  our costs for cans and ends will be comparably impacted and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if impress is unable to secure another source of steel  our supply of cans and ends may be interrupted and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if other events occur that result in increased steel costs or steel shortages  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  causing us to be highly leveraged 
as of may   we had a total of  million of indebtedness 
our indebtedness could have important consequences  such as limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund growth  working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other cash requirements  limiting our operational flexibility due to the covenants contained in our debt agreements  limiting our ability to invest operating cash flow in our business due to debt service requirements  limiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as highly leveraged and that may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns  increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and changing market conditions  and increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates  to the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates 

table of contents if our cash from operations is not sufficient to enable us to reduce our debt as anticipated  our interest expense could be materially higher than anticipated and our financial performance could be adversely affected 
if our cash from operations is not sufficient to meet our expenses and debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance our debt  sell assets  borrow additional money or raise equity 
we expect to generate the funds necessary to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt from our operations 
because portions of our business are highly seasonal  our borrowings under our revolving credit facility fluctuate significantly during the year  generally peaking in september or october 
our ability to generate cash to pay expenses and service and reduce debt depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to meet our expenses and debt service obligations and to reduce our debt will depend on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  legislative  regulatory and other factors  including potential changes in consumer preferences  the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors 
any factor that negatively affects our results of operations  including our cash flow  may also negatively affect our ability to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt 
if we are unable to reduce our debt as anticipated  our interest expense could be materially higher than anticipated and our financial performance could be adversely affected 
if we do not have enough money to pay our debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  borrow more money or raise equity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able  at any given time  to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us or at all 
despite our significant indebtedness  we may still be able to incur substantially more debt through additional borrowings 
this could further exacerbate the risks described above 
while our credit facility generally restricts borrowings outside the existing facility  it does permit additional indebtedness pursuant to specified exceptions 
for example  subject to satisfaction of debt incurrence tests contained in our two senior subordinated note indentures and other conditions including pro forma covenant compliance  we are permitted to incur an amount not to exceed million of additional unsecured indebtedness and we are permitted to borrow  subject to the willingness of lenders to fund such borrowing and other conditions including pro forma covenant compliance  an additional million through an increase in the term loan facility under our existing credit facility 
further  with the concurrence of our senior lenders and satisfaction of our note indenture debt incurrence tests  we could incur substantial additional indebtedness in connection with  for example  an acquisition 
if our current debt level increases  the related risks we face could intensify 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants  which may restrict our operational flexibility 
our ability to comply with these restrictions depends on many factors beyond our control 
our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  among other things  to incur liens  sell assets other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business  enter into consolidations or mergers  make loans and investments  incur additional indebtedness  enter into transactions with our affiliates  enter into contingent obligations including guaranties  enter into joint ventures and partnerships  pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase capital stock  make capital expenditures  agree to restrictions on subsidiary dividends and other payments  and enter into sale leaseback transactions 
our credit facility also limits our ability to agree to certain change of control transactions  because a change of control as defined in the 
table of contents senior credit facility results in an event of default 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios 
our ability to meet these financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will comply with these ratios 
a breach of any of the covenants  ratios or restrictions under our credit facility could result in an event of default under the credit facility  in which case the lenders under the facility could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility to be immediately due and payable 
such acceleration would constitute an event of default under each of our senior subordinated note indentures  in which case all amounts outstanding under the indentures could be declared immediately due and payable 
we have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure the debt outstanding under our credit facility 
in addition  our existing senior subordinated note indentures contain covenants that limit the ability of dmc  and the ability of dmc s restricted subsidiaries as defined in the indentures  to pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase capital stock  make loans and investments  enter into transactions with affiliates  incur additional indebtedness  enter into contingent obligations including guaranties  sell assets other than in the ordinary course of business  incur liens  agree to restrictions on subsidiary dividends and other payments  and enter into consolidations or mergers 
in addition  the restrictive covenants in our senior subordinated note indentures include a covenant limiting the ability of dmfc to enter into any consolidation  merger or sale of substantially all of its assets 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable indenture  in which case all amounts outstanding under such indenture and the credit facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such an acceleration would also constitute an event of default under the other senior subordinated note indenture  in which case all amounts outstanding under such indenture could be declared immediately due and payable 
we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness under our credit facility and under our senior subordinated note indentures that would become due as a result of any acceleration under any or all of such debt agreements 
our efforts and investments to improve the acquired businesses may not be successful  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
we derive a significant portion of our net sales and net income from the operations of the acquired businesses 
in recent years  the acquired businesses have had declining sales and have lost market share in several of their product lines  including pet food and infant feeding 
through significant investment in product improvement and sales and marketing efforts relating to the acquired businesses since the merger  we have sought to reverse this trend 
we expect to continue to expend significant effort and resources to support the brands of the acquired businesses  particularly in our pet products business 
our efforts to improve the results of operations of the acquired businesses and to increase the market share of their product lines may not be successful 
if these efforts are not successful  our business  and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategies to reduce costs 
failure to reduce costs could adversely affect our results of operations 
the success of our business strategy depends in part on our ability to reduce costs 
because our ability to raise prices for our products generally is affected by factors outside of our control  such as aggregate industry supply and market demand  our profitability and growth depends on our efforts to control our operating costs 
because some costs  such as commodity costs  are outside our control  we generally must seek to reduce costs in other areas  such as operating efficiency 
if we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within 
table of contents budget  if at all  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
in addition  if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date  or any future cost savings initiatives  do not generate expected cost savings and synergies  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our operating results will depend  in part  on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs 
in general  due to the highly competitive nature of the businesses in which we compete  we must increase or maintain our level of promotional and marketing investment with respect to our businesses to sustain our competitive position in our markets 
the effectiveness of our marketing practices and advertising campaigns is important to our ability to retain and expand our market share 
we expect to continue to expend significant marketing and advertising resources on a number of our businesses  including pet products and tuna pouch products  that we believe are in product categories that respond favorably to marketing and advertising 
if our marketing and advertising campaigns are not successful  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
if we do not successfully implement our trade spending improvement project  our volumes and market share may decline  our expenses may increase and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
we are currently undertaking a project to substantially enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our trade promotion programs 
this project affects the timing and methods of how we plan promotional programs with customers  structure promotions and track the effectiveness of promotions 
to the extent that we are unable to increase the effectiveness of our trade promotion programs  refocus our trade promotion expenditures on more effective promotions  reduce the incidence of forward buying purchases by a customer during a promotional period that are in excess of what such customer expects to sell to consumers during such promotional period and meet our intended new promotional planning cycles  our trade spending improvement project may not be effective 
in such event  our budgeted trade promotion spending may not generate our expected sales volumes 
if this occurs  or if we increase trade promotion spending in order to generate sales volume  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  our trade promotion improvement project involves the implementation of a new it platform across all our businesses for tracking trade promotion programs 
if adoption of the platform disrupts our trade promotion practices  our results of operations may suffer 
if we do not successfully implement our network improvement project  our results of operations will suffer 
we are currently undertaking a network improvement project in order to capture potential cost savings opportunities and efficiencies and to develop an integrated logistics network that is designed to be more convenient to customers and more efficient 
we are seeking to improve shipping efficiency by implementing a primary point of distribution system and consolidating our distribution centers  thereby reducing total system transportation miles and lease and operating costs 
any errors or delays in implementing this project  including the related systems and decisions regarding optimal distribution center locations and sizes  could eliminate the anticipated cost savings associated with the project and result in supply disruptions  which could adversely affect our business  customer relationships  sales  market share and results of operations 
if the costs associated with our network improvement project  including the consolidation of our distribution centers  are greater than anticipated  or if our network improvement project does not yield the cost savings we expect  our results of operations would be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we may be unable to anticipate changes in consumer preferences  which may result in decreased demand for our products 
our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and offer products that appeal to the changing tastes  dietary habits and trends and product packaging preferences of consumers and  as applicable  their pets  in the market categories in which we compete 
if we are not able to anticipate  identify or develop and market products that respond to these changes in consumer preferences  demand for our products may decline and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to successfully introduce new products  which could decrease our profitability 
our future business and financial growth depend  in part  on our ability to successfully introduce new products and improved products 
we introduce new products and improved products in all of our businesses from time to time 
our strategy to grow our profits depends on product innovation 
we incur significant development and marketing costs in connection with the introduction of new products 
successfully launching and selling new products puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources 
if customers and consumers do not accept a new product  then the introduction of a new product can reduce our operating income as introduction costs  including slotting fees  may exceed revenues 
if we are not consistently successful in marketing and selling new products  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected  our revenues could decrease  our growth rate could drop  and our profitability could decline 
if we do not compete successfully and maintain the market shares of our products  our business and revenues may be adversely affected 
our businesses are highly competitive 
there are numerous brands and products that compete for shelf space and sales  with competition based primarily on quality  breadth of product line  brand awareness  price  taste  nutrition  variety  packaging and value added customer services such as inventory management services 
we compete with a significant number of companies of varying sizes  including divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies 
our branded products face strong competition from private label products  imports  other national and regional brands and fresh alternatives 
in our private label sales  we face strong competition at the customer level against other private label providers 
at the consumer level  our private label products face strong competition from branded products  other private label products  imports and fresh alternatives 
a number of our competitors have broader product lines  substantially greater financial and other resources and or lower fixed costs than we have 
our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products that are more attractive to customers or consumers than ours 
these competitors may also prove to be more successful in marketing and selling their products than we are  and may be better able to increase prices to reflect current cost pressures 
we cannot assure you that we can compete successfully with these other companies 
we cannot predict the pricing or promotional activities of our competitors or whether they will have a negative effect on us 
currently  many of our competitors  including those in the pet products  infant feeding  tuna  tomatoes  soup and fruit businesses  are engaged in aggressive pricing and promotional activities 
there are competitive pressures and other factors which could cause our products to lose market share or result in significant price or margin erosion  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully increase product distribution to high volume club stores and mass merchandisers 
the success of our business strategy depends  in part  on our ability to increase our product distribution  and consequently our sales  through high volume club stores  such as sam s club and 
table of contents costco  supercenters and mass merchandisers  such as wal mart supercenters 
consumers are increasingly shopping at club stores and mass merchandisers as an alternative to traditional grocery channels 
if we are unable to increase sales and product distribution through these channels  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
the competition to supply products to these high volume stores is intense  particularly where a store elects to carry only one of a particular type of product 
these high volume club stores and mass merchandisers frequently re evaluate the products they carry and if a major club customer elected to stop carrying one of our products  our sales could be adversely affected 
some store buying decisions are based upon a periodic bidding process in which the successful bidder is only assured of selling its selected products to the club store until the next bidding process 
our sales volume could decrease significantly if our offer is too high and we lose the ability to sell products  even temporarily  through these channels 
conversely  we risk depressing our margins if our offer is successful but below our desired price points 
either of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
in order to maintain key volume in the face of competition  we may agree to supply some of these stores below desired price points  which could also depress our margins 
because we are dependent upon a limited number of customers  the loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations 
a relatively limited number of customers account for a large percentage of our total net sales  including the sales of the acquired businesses 
during fiscal  our top customer  wal mart including wal mart s stores and supercenters as well as sam s club  represented approximately of our sales overall and an even higher percentage of sales of our pet products business 
our ten largest customers represented approximately of our overall sales 
these percentages may increase if the recent trends of consolidation among food retailers and the growth of mass merchandisers continue 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a small number of customers 
these customers do not typically enter into long term contracts and generally purchase our products as the customers current inventory levels are depleted 
these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price  product quality  consumer demand and customer service performance 
they may in the future use more of their shelf space  including space currently used for our products  for private label products 
we provide some products  especially soup products and some pet products  on a private label basis to some large customers 
if any such customer selected a different manufacturer to supply it with such private label products  our sales would be adversely affected 
additionally  these customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if our sales of products to one or more of these customers are reduced  this reduction may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
bankruptcy or other business disruption of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations 
loss of a significant customer could also adversely affect our reputation 
consolidation in the retail food industry has resulted in large sophisticated customers who may pressure us to lower our prices or take other actions 
as the consolidation trend among food retailers continues and our retail customers  including mass merchandisers  grow larger and become more sophisticated  these food retailers may demand lower pricing  increased promotional programs or special packaging from product suppliers 
meeting these demands may adversely affect our margins 
if we are not selected by our large food retailer customers for most of our products or if we fail to effectively respond to their demands  our sales and profitability could be adversely affected 

table of contents our large customers may impose requirements upon us that may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
from time to time  our large retail customers  including wal mart  may re evaluate or refine their business practices and  in connection therewith  impose new or revised requirements upon their suppliers  including us 
these business demands may relate to inventory practices  logistics or other aspects of the customer supplier relationship 
for example  wal mart and other customers have indicated a desire to utilize radio frequency identification rfid technology in an effort to improve tracking and management of product in their supply chain 
large scale implementation of this technology would significantly increase our product manufacturing and distribution costs 
we are investigating the potential business costs and benefits of this technology  and intend to work closely with our customers to manage the proper application of this technology 
decisions by customers to maintain lower inventory levels may also adversely affect our business 
compliance with requirements imposed by significant customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  if we fail to meet a significant customer s demands  we could lose that customer s business  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
to the extent our customers purchase product in excess of consumer consumption in any period  our sales in a subsequent period may be adversely affected as customers seek to reduce their inventory levels 
from time to time  customers may purchase more product than they expect to sell to consumers during a particular time period 
customers may grow their inventory in anticipation of  or during  our promotional events  which typically provide for reduced prices during a specified time or other customer or consumer incentives 
if a customer increases its inventory during a particular reporting period as a result of a promotional event or otherwise  then sales during the subsequent reporting period may be adversely impacted as customers seek to reduce their inventory to usual levels 
this effect may be particularly pronounced when promotional events occur near the end or beginning of a reporting period 
to the extent customers seek to reduce their usual or customary inventory levels  the impact of such de inventorying would be even greater 
these practices may adversely affect our results of operations during reporting periods following those in which our promotional events occur 
we use a single national broker to represent a majority of our branded products to the retail grocery trade and any failure by the broker to effectively represent us would adversely affect our business 
we use a single national broker to represent a majority of our branded products to the retail grocery trade 
our business would suffer substantial disruption if this broker were to default in the performance of its obligations to perform brokerage services or if this broker fails to effectively represent us to the retail grocery trade 
we may not be successful in our future acquisition endeavors  if any  which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have historically engaged in substantial acquisition activity 
we may be unable to identify suitable targets  opportunistic or otherwise  for acquisition in the future 
if we identify a suitable acquisition candidate  our ability to successfully implement the acquisition would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements 
if we need to obtain our lenders consent to an 
table of contents acquisition  they may condition their consent on our compliance with additional restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility 
acquisitions involve risks  including those associated with integrating the operations  financial reporting  disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies  managing geographically dispersed operations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience  unknown risks  and the potential loss of key employees  customers and strategic partners of acquired companies 
we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
acquisitions may be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
acquisitions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of  among other things  the incurrence of debt  one time write offs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets 
in addition  future acquisitions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 
consumers may not react favorably to the re branding of our primary infant feeding product 
in early  we rebranded the line of nature s goodness infant feeding products that we acquired in the merger as del monte nature s goodness and ceased using the heinz brand name on this line 
we cannot assure you that there will not be any adverse consumer reaction to our rebranding strategy 
our ability to competitively serve our customers depends on the availability of reliable and low cost transportation 
disruption of the supply of these services and or significant increases in the cost of these services could impact our results of operations 
we use multiple forms of transportation to bring our products to market 
they include ships  trucks  intermodals and railcars 
disruption to the timely supply of these services or significant increases in the cost of these services for any reason  including availability or cost of fuel  could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers  and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
we are currently paying significant fuel surcharges 
if the cost of fuel remains at current high levels  or continues to increase  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business could be affected adversely by the bankruptcy of fleming companies  inc on april   fleming companies  inc  et al fleming filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
fleming was one of our top customers  by sales  for fiscal we have filed claims against fleming in this bankruptcy proceeding for amounts owed by fleming to us 
on february   fleming filed an action against us in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware seeking a total of million in alleged preferential transfers  alleged payments due and payable under the terms of the military distribution agreements between the parties  alleged duplicate and overpayments made by fleming and deductions to which fleming alleges it is entitled under various trade promotion programs 
although we believe we have adequate reserves to cover any material liability and bad debt that may result from these proceedings  the bankruptcy court may order us to pay an amount to fleming that exceeds these reserves 
in this event  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see item legal proceedings for a detailed discussion of the fleming bankruptcy litigation 
our insurance may not be sufficient to cover losses we may incur 
our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations 
for example  we may be liable for claims brought by employees  customers or other third parties for personal injury or 
table of contents property damage occurring in the course of our operations 
we minimize these risks through various insurance contracts from third party insurance carriers 
however  we retain an insurance risk for the deductible portion of each claim 
our estimate of retained insurance liabilities is subject to change as new events or circumstances develop which might materially impact the ultimate cost to settle these losses 
we cannot assure you that our insurance will be sufficient to cover our losses 
any losses that are not completely covered could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the insurance industry has become more selective in offering some types of insurance coverage and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future 
the insurance industry has become more selective in offering some types of insurance coverage  such as property  product liability  product recall and directors and officers liability insurance 
we were able to obtain these insurance coverages for calendar  and our calendar insurance program is consistent with both our past level of coverage and our risk management policies 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain comparable insurance coverage at favorable terms  or at all  in the future 
if we are subject to product liability claims  we may incur significant and unexpected costs and our business reputation could be adversely affected 
we may be exposed to product liability claims and adverse public relations if consumption  use or opening of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur in connection with product liability claims 
for example  punitive damages are generally not covered by insurance 
we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
a product liability judgment against us  or our agreement to settle a product liability claim could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures  which would reduce operating profit and cash flow 
in addition  even if product liability claims against us are not successful or are not fully pursued  these claims would likely be costly and time consuming and may require management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating our business 
product liability claims  or any other events that cause consumers to no longer associate our brands with high quality and safe products  may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products 
product liability claims may also lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our brands  business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we experience product recalls  we may incur significant and unexpected costs and our business reputation could be adversely affected 
we may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations 
a product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures  which would reduce operating profit and cash flow 
in addition  a product recall may require significant management attention 
product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products 
product recalls may also lead to increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies of our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our brands  business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in income tax laws could adversely affect our results 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rates could be increased by changes in tax laws or interpretations of these laws  or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
any increase in our effective tax 
table of contents rates will cause our net profits to decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in operating income at some of our subsidiaries may result in changes to our effective tax rate 
in addition to our domestic production facilities  we use or our co packer uses operating facilities in ecuador and american samoa for the production of tuna products 
we also have operating facilities in canada  where we produce pet products  and in venezuela  where we produce vegetable and tomato products 
our foreign subsidiaries and our operations conducted in foreign locations are subject to different tax rates depending on the applicable jurisdiction 
changes in the amounts of products produced in these countries and the related operating income may result in changes in our effective tax rate 
for example  our products produced in american samoa  primarily canned tuna  are taxed at a preferential tax rate 
to the extent our proportion of operating income attributable to american samoa decreases  our effective tax rate will increase 
we may not continue to benefit from preferential tax treatment for our products produced in american samoa if the legislation providing for such treatment is not renewed 
section of the internal revenue code generally provides a federal income tax credit for income earned from a business conducted within a united states possession 
we currently receive the benefit of this credit with respect to income from our canned tuna business in american samoa  this credit resulted in savings of approximately million in tax expense for us in fiscal the legislation providing for this federal income tax credit is scheduled to expire and we cannot assure you that it will be renewed 
if the legislation is not renewed  we expect that our effective federal income tax rate on income attributable to our operations in american samoa will increase and our net profits will decrease accordingly for fiscal years subsequent to april severe weather conditions and natural disasters can affect crop or fish supplies  which can adversely affect our operations and our results of operations 
severe weather conditions and natural disasters  such as floods  droughts  frosts  earthquakes or pestilence  may affect the supply of our products or cause us to temporarily close our facilities 
irregular weather patterns may persist over a long period and further impact the supply of our products 
these events can result in reduced supplies of raw materials  lower recoveries of usable raw materials  higher costs of cold storage if harvests are accelerated and processing capacity is unavailable or interruptions in our production schedules if harvests are delayed 
competing manufacturers can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations 
some of our tuna operations are located in areas where natural disasters such as hurricanes can occur 
changes in the weather may also change the thermoclines in which fish such as tuna may be located 
if fish are driven to lower thermoclines  it may be harder for fishermen to catch these fish  which could reduce the supply of tuna 
if our supplies of raw materials are reduced  we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms  if at all  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  if our tuna operations are badly damaged by a natural disaster  we may be subject to supply interruptions  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our del monte brands operating segment s results of operations are highly seasonal 
interference with our production schedule during peak months could negatively impact our results of operations 
we do not manufacture the majority of our del monte brands products continuously throughout the year  but instead have a seasonal production period that is limited to approximately three to four 
table of contents months primarily during the summer each year 
we refer to this period as the pack season 
our working capital requirements related to these businesses are also seasonal and are highest in our first and second fiscal quarters 
an unexpected plant shutdown or any other material interference with our production schedule could adversely affect our results of operations 
our del monte brands sales tend to peak in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year  mainly as a result of the holiday period in november and december and the easter holiday 
by contrast  in the first fiscal quarter of each year  sales are generally lower  mainly due to less promotional activity and the availability of fresh produce 
we believe that the main trends in our results of operations are relatively predictable and that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund operations during periods of low sales 
if these trends were to change or be disrupted  however  our results of operations could be adversely affected  and we could require additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital and other cash requirements 
in the majority of our del monte brands businesses  the inventory created during the pack season  plus any inventory carried over from the previous pack season  determines the quantity of inventory we have available for sale until the next pack season commences 
the size of the pack is influenced by crop results  which is affected by the weather and other factors 
similarly  the timing of the pack season depends upon crop timing  which in turn is affected by the weather and other factors 
in the event that the inventory produced during the pack season is less than desired  or if the new pack season is delayed  we may be required to allocate or limit sales of some items to customers in an effort to stretch supplies until the new pack season begins and new product is available 
in the event we are required to allocate or limit sales of some items  we may lose sales volume and market share and our customer relationships may be harmed 
we rely upon co packers to provide our supply of some products 
any failure by co packers to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our financial performance 
we have a number of supply agreements with co packers that require them to provide us with specific finished products 
for some of our products  including each of canned pineapple  some fruit in plastic containers  some fruit in glass jars  pickles  dry beans  ready to serve soup  some dog snack and pet food products  and most of our tuna pouch products  we essentially rely upon a single co packer as our sole source for the product 
the failure for any reason of any such sole source or other co packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements with us could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods and have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
additionally  from time to time  a co packer may experience financial difficulties or bankruptcy  which could disrupt our supply of finished goods or require that we incur additional expense by providing financial accommodations to the co packer or taking other steps to seek to minimize or avoid supply disruption  such as establishing a new co pack arrangement with another provider 
a new co pack arrangement may not be available on terms as favorable to us as the existing co pack arrangement  if at all 
some of our co packers are competitors 
in order to achieve economies of scale  cost savings or other strategic goals  we may from time to time enter into co pack arrangements with competitors 
currently  we have co pack arrangements with competitors for some of our vegetables  tomato paste and a portion of our tuna supply 
these co pack arrangements may provide competitors with know how or other information or economies of scale that enable them to compete more effectively against us 
in addition  to the extent that a co packer is also a competitor  we may be at greater risk of supply disruption  in spite of contractual protections  in the event of raw material  commodity and ingredient shortages 

table of contents the terms in our supply agreement for cans and ends with impress could adversely affect the profitability of our products 
impress supplies metal cans and ends for our pet and tuna businesses 
our agreement with impress includes minimum volume purchase requirements and guarantees a minimum financial return to impress 
these terms may result in increases in the unit costs of our pet and tuna products if we reduce our production levels 
we are subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks  which may adversely affect our business 
as a result of our agricultural and food processing operations  we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent and compliance with them is becoming increasingly expensive 
we cannot predict the extent to which any environmental law or regulation that may be enacted or enforced in the future may affect our operations 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp and may be liable for environmental investigation and remediation costs at some designated superfund sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  or under similar state laws 
we are defending ourselves in these actions as we believe appropriate 
however  we cannot assure you that none of these matters will adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
we may in the future be named as a prp at other currently or previously owned or operated sites  and additional remediation requirements could be imposed on us 
other properties where we conduct or have conducted operations could be identified for investigation or proposed for listing under cercla or similar state laws 
also  under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the food quality protection act of  the us environmental protection agency is involved in a series of regulatory actions relating to the evaluation and use of pesticides in the food industry 
the effect of these actions and future actions on the availability and use of pesticides could adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
if the cost of compliance with applicable environmental laws or regulations increases  our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
government regulation could increase our costs of production and increase legal and regulatory expenses 
manufacturing  processing  labeling  packaging  storing and distributing food products are activities that are subject to extensive federal  state and local regulation 
these aspects of our operations are regulated by the us food and drug administration fda  the united states department of agriculture usda and various state and local public health and agricultural agencies 
in addition to periodic government agency inspections affecting our operations generally  our operations  which produce meat and poultry products  are subject to mandatory continuous on site inspections by the usda 
complying with government regulation  including any new regulations such as the new federal country of origin labeling cool labeling requirements  can be costly 
failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  including  among others california s proposition  could subject us to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  recalls or seizures  as well as potential criminal sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is also affected by import and export controls and similar laws and regulations 
issues such as national security or health and safety  which slow or otherwise restrict imports could adversely affect our business 
in addition  the modification of existing laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise adversely affect the way that we have historically operated our business 

table of contents risk associated with foreign operations  including changes in import export duties  wage rates  political or economic climates  or exchange rates  may adversely affect our operations 
our foreign operations and relationships with foreign suppliers and co packers subject us to the risks of doing business abroad 
the countries from which we source our products may be subject to political and economic instability  and may periodically enact new or revise existing laws  taxes  duties  quotas  tariffs  currency controls or other restrictions to which we are subject 
our products are subject to import duties and other restrictions  and the united states government may periodically impose new or revise existing duties  quotas  tariffs or other restrictions to which we are subject 
in addition  changes in respective wage rates among the countries from which we and our competitors source product could substantially impact our competitive position 
for example  wage rates in american samoa are currently substantially higher than wage rates in thailand 
however  currently this wage rate difference is generally offset by the fact that us tariffs are currently imposed on thai products but not on american samoa products 
changes in exchange rates  import export duties or relative international wage rates applicable to us or our competitors could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations and require us to restructure our business in order to remain competitive 
because our competitors may have operations in different foreign jurisdictions than we have  such changes may impact us in a different manner than our competitors 
our business may be adversely affected by united states or foreign government regulations relating to agricultural diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy bse or mad cow disease 
in december  the usda announced that a single case of bse had been diagnosed in a washington state dairy cow 
there are high levels of global public concern about bse
