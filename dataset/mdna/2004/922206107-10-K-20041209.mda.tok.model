the business also supplies products to the company s scientific instruments and vacuum technologies businesses 
for financial information about industry segments including foreign and domestic operations and export sales  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
marketing and sales in the united states  the company markets the largest portion of its products directly through its own sales and distribution organizations  although a few products and services are marketed through independent distributors and sales representatives 
sales to major markets outside the united states are generally made by the company s foreign based sales and service staff  although some export sales are made directly from the united states to foreign customers 
in addition  in certain foreign countries  sales are made through various representative and distributorship arrangements 
the company maintains sales and service offices in strategic regional locations in the united states and  through its sales subsidiaries  in key foreign locations 
the markets in which the company competes are  for the most part  global 
sales outside of north america accounted for   and of sales for fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a result  the company s customers increasingly require service and support on a worldwide basis 
in addition to the united states  the company has sales and service offices located throughout europe  asia  and latin america 
the company has invested substantial financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of its customers worldwide 

table of contents demand for the company s products depends on many factors  including the level of capital expenditures of the company s customers  the rate of economic growth in the company s major markets  and competitive considerations 
no single customer accounted for or more of the company s sales in fiscal year   or the company experiences some cyclical patterns in sales of its products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in the first fiscal quarter october to december and many customers defer december deliveries until the next calendar year  the company s second fiscal quarter 
the company s fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including general economic conditions  acquisitions  and new product introductions 
the company believes that it differentiates its products from those of its competitors by its responsiveness to customer requirements  as determined through market research 
although specific customer requirements can vary depending on applications  customers generally demand superior performance  high quality  high productivity  and low cost of ownership 
the company has responded to these customer demands by introducing new products focused on these requirements in the markets it serves 
for example  customers of scientific instruments products have demanded higher levels of analytical throughput to support their research programs aimed at drug discovery and advanced life sciences 
the company has responded to these needs by introducing products with higher levels of automation and computerized data analysis routines 
backlog the company s recorded backlog including deferred revenue included in the consolidated balance sheet was million at october   million at october   and million at september  backlog increased from october  to october  primarily due to the receipt of a large amount of longer lead time orders by the electronics manufacturing segment late in fiscal year backlog decreased from september  to october  primarily due to the recognition of revenue during fiscal year on several leading edge nmr and mr imaging systems and accessories that were previously deferred pending delivery and or customer acceptance 
the company includes in backlog purchase orders or production releases under blanket purchase orders that have firm delivery dates 
recorded backlog in us dollars is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  recorded backlog might not result in sales because of cancellations or other factors 
most of the company s products are shipped soon after they are ordered by customers  with the time between order receipt and shipment being as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
however  certain other products  in particular leading edge nmr and mr imaging systems  can have significantly longer lead times  sometimes in excess of one year 
significant shipments often occur in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how customers place orders and schedule shipments 
the company believes that over of orders included in the backlog at october  will result in revenue before the end of fiscal year however  this percentage should not be taken as an indicator for orders received after october  because of the longer lead times associated with the magnets now supplied by the company as a result of the magnex acquisition 
competition competition in markets served by the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments is primarily based upon the performance capabilities of products  technical support  and after market service  the manufacturer s reputation as a technological leader  and product pricing 
the company believes that performance capabilities are the most important of these criteria 
with respect to markets served by the electronics manufacturing segment  competition is primarily based upon assembly and test capabilities  technical expertise and support  flexibility and responsiveness of 
table of contents logistics management capabilities  the manufacturer s financial stability  and product pricing 
the company believes that technical expertise and support are the most important of these criteria 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive and are characterized by the application of advanced technology 
there are numerous companies that specialize in  and a number of larger companies that devote a significant portion of their resources to  the development  manufacture  sale  and service of products that compete with those manufactured  sold  or serviced by the company 
many of the company s competitors are well known manufacturers with a high degree of technical proficiency 
in addition  competition is intensified by the ever changing nature of the technologies in the industries in which the company is engaged 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by specialized manufacturers that often have strength in narrow segments of these markets 
while the absence of reliable statistics makes it difficult to determine the company s relative market position in its industry segments  the company is one of the principal manufacturers in its primary fields 
each of the company s major business segments competes with many companies that address the same markets 
the company s scientific instruments business competes with agilent technologies  bruker  jeol  perkinelmer  shimadzu  thermo electron  waters  and other smaller suppliers 
the company s vacuum technologies business competes with adixen alcatel  boc edwards high vacuum  inficon  leybold vacuum  pfeiffer vacuum technology  ulvac  and other smaller suppliers 
the company s electronics manufacturing business competes with numerous other companies that provide high mix  low volume contract manufacturing services  including pemstar  plexus  sigmatron international  suntron  and privately owned regional and off shore manufacturers 
manufacturing the company s principal manufacturing activities consist of precision assembly  test  calibration  and certain specialized machining activities 
the company subcontracts a portion of its assembly and machining 
all other assembly  test  and calibration functions are performed by the company 
the company believes that the ability to manufacture reliable products in a cost effective manner is critical to meeting the just in time delivery and other demanding requirements of its oem and end user customers

table of contents results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year segment results our operations are grouped into three reportable business segments scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing 
the following table presents comparisons of our sales and operating earnings for each of our three segments and in total for fiscal years and fiscal year ended october  october  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions sales by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies electronics manufacturing total company operating earnings by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies electronics manufacturing total segments general corporate total company scientific instruments 
the increase in scientific instruments sales was primarily attributable to higher volume  particularly in europe 
to a lesser extent  the weaker u 
s dollar also contributed to the increase in sales  principally in europe 
general economic improvement and increased customer demand for our newer products drove increased sales in both life science and industrial applications 
scientific instruments operating earnings reflect pretax restructuring and other related costs of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively see restructuring activities below 
excluding the impact of these restructuring and other related costs  the decrease in operating earnings as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from lower gross profit margins  which were adversely affected by a mix shift toward lower margin high field nmr systems and leading edge cold probes for nmr and away from higher margin low field nmr systems  and by higher sales and marketing costs 
sales and marketing costs were higher as a percentage of sales due to higher order based commissions and the weaker us dollar  which increased costs for most non us operations 
the decrease in operating earnings as a percentage of sales from these factors was partially offset by stronger sales of higher margin mass spectrometry products 
vacuum technologies 
the sales increase in vacuum technologies resulted primarily from an increase in the volume of products sold into both life science and industrial applications 
in life science applications  sales growth was driven by increased demand for turbomolecular pumps for use in oem mass spectrometers 
industrial sales growth came from higher demand for pumps for broad industrial uses including semiconductor applications 
to a lesser extent  the weaker us dollar also contributed to the increase in sales  particularly in europe 
the increase in vacuum technologies operating earnings as a percentage of sales in fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher gross profit margins due to sales volume leverage and a mix shift toward higher margin products as well as approximately million in a patent suit settlement and approximately million of pretax restructuring costs that were incurred in fiscal year vacuum technologies operating costs were also lower as a percentage of sales in fiscal year  primarily due to sales volume leverage 

table of contents electronics manufacturing 
the increase in electronics manufacturing sales was primarily due to higher volume from industrial customers as well as approximately million in incremental revenues from new customers obtained through an acquisition completed during the third quarter of fiscal year the decrease in electronics manufacturing operating earnings as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower gross margins in fiscal year these lower gross margins were attributable to higher start up costs relating to new business from existing customers and a mix shift toward some lower margin industrial equipment products in fiscal year  partially offset by the impact of approximately million in pretax transition costs associated with the acquisition completed in fiscal year consolidated results the following table presents comparisons of our sales and other selected consolidated financial results for fiscal years and fiscal year ended october  october  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions  except per share data sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative purchased in process research and development total operating expenses operating earnings interest income interest expense income tax expense net earnings net earnings per diluted share sales 
as shown above  fiscal year sales by the scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing segments increased by   and  respectively  compared to fiscal year sales 
the improvement in sales was primarily attributable to general economic improvement and continued acceptance of our newer products  which was partially offset by the shorter fiscal year which comprised weeks compared to fiscal year which comprised weeks 
geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million  and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases of   and  respectively  compared to fiscal year all three segments experienced an increase in sales across all major geographic regions that they served except for scientific instruments sales into north america  which were flat  and the pacific rim  which were lower 
the decrease in sales in the pacific rim in fiscal year was primarily due to lower sales of high field nmr systems into that region as compared to fiscal year this decrease was partially offset by continued growth in sales of other scientific instruments and vacuum technologies products into the pacific rim and higher scientific instruments sales into latin america 
the overall increase in north america sales was primarily due to higher demand for products from the vacuum technologies and electronics manufacturing segments 
the increase in europe was driven by improved scientific instruments and vacuum technologies sales  in part  this reflects the currency effect of the stronger euro in fiscal year gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of sales was basically flat 
higher start up costs relating to new business from existing customers and a mix shift toward some lower margin industrial equipment 
table of contents products in the electronics manufacturing segment reduced the gross profit percentage by approximately one half of one percent 
in the scientific instruments segment  the adverse impact of a mix shift toward lower margin high field nmr systems and nmr cold probes and away from higher margin low field nmr systems was only partially offset by the impact of stronger sales of higher margin mass spectrometry products and application based consumable products in fiscal year  the net impact of these factors was a reduction in the overall gross profit percentage of around one half of one percent 
these decreases were substantially offset by a higher gross profit percentage in the vacuum technologies segment  primarily as a result of sales volume leverage and a mix shift toward higher margin products 
sales and marketing 
the slight increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales was due primarily to the weaker us dollar  which increased costs for most non us operations  and higher order based commissions 
research and development 
research and development spending was relatively constant as a percentage of sales  as the company increased its investment in research and development  particularly in the areas of nmr and mr imaging  mass spectroscopy  and consumable products  with a bias toward life science applications 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal year included approximately million in pretax restructuring and other related costs as well as pretax gains of approximately million relating to the curtailment of defined benefit pension plans in australia and the netherlands these curtailment gains were offset by a related defined benefit plan settlement loss of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal year 
in comparison  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year included approximately million in pretax restructuring costs and a pretax patent suit settlement of million 
excluding the impact of these items  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased in fiscal year primarily as a result of lower administrative costs in the electronics manufacturing segment 
we currently anticipate that general and administrative expenses will be adversely impacted in fiscal year by the cost of complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
restructuring activities 
fiscal year plans 
during fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to reorganize the management structure in our scientific instruments factories in australia and the netherlands 
these actions were undertaken to narrow the strategic and operational focus of these factories and involved the termination of three senior managers 
these actions were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year all severance and other employee related costs relating to this restructuring plan were recorded and included in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and are currently expected to be settled by the end of fiscal year this restructuring plan did not involve any non cash components 
the following table sets forth changes in the company s liability relating to the foregoing restructuring plan during fiscal year fiscal year employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense cash payments balance at october  also during fiscal year  we committed to a separate plan to reorganize our scientific instruments and corporate marketing organizations and to consolidate certain scientific instruments administrative functions in north america 
this plan  which involves the termination of approximately employees  was undertaken to more closely align the strategic and operational focus of these organizations across different product lines and to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs 
these actions were initiated in 
table of contents the fourth quarter of fiscal year and are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year all severance and other employee related costs relating to this restructuring plan were recorded and included in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and are currently expected to be settled during the first half of fiscal year this restructuring plan did not involve any non cash components 
the following table sets forth changes in the company s liability relating to the foregoing restructuring plan during fiscal year fiscal year employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at october  charges to expense balance at october  fiscal year plan 
during fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to improve efficiency and more closely align employee skill sets and other resources with our evolving product mix as a result of our continued emphasis on nmr  mass spectroscopy  and consumable products  with a bias toward life science applications 
in addition  actions were undertaken to create a more efficient consumable products operation 
these actions primarily impacted the scientific instruments segment and involved the termination of approximately employees principally in our sales and marketing  administration  service  and manufacturing functions  the closure of three sales offices and the consolidation of three consumable products factories into one in southern california 
substantially all of these activities were completed during fiscal year except for the termination of approximately employees  which took place in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  and the southern california facility consolidation  which was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal year and is expected to be substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal year costs relating to these restructuring activities have been included in general and administrative expenses

during fiscal year  we incurred approximately million in other costs relating directly to the southern california facility consolidation that were in addition to the restructuring costs described above 
these costs included approximately million of non cash charges for accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed of upon the closure of facilities  approximately million in facility relocation costs  and approximately million in employee retention and relocation costs 

table of contents we currently anticipate that general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year will include approximately million in pretax restructuring costs and approximately million in other related costs comprised of anticipated non cash charges for accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed in connection with the completion of the southern california facility consolidation 
restructuring cost savings 
when they were initiated  each of the foregoing restructuring plans was eventually expected to result in a reduction of annual operating expenses 
the following table sets forth the estimated annual cost savings for each plan as well as where those cost savings were expected to be realized restructuring plan estimated annual cost savings fiscal year plan million million fiscal year plan scientific instruments factory management million million fiscal year plan scientific instruments and corporate marketing organizations  scientific instruments administrative functions million million these estimated costs savings are primarily expected to impact selling  general  and administrative expenses and  to a lesser extent  cost of sales 
some of these cost savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in other parts of our business  for example  as part of our continued emphasis on nmr and mr imaging  mass spectroscopy  and consumable products  with a bias toward life science applications 
in addition  unrelated cost increases in other areas of our operations such as corporate compliance costs could offset some of these cost savings 
although it is difficult to quantify with any precision our actual cost savings to date from these activities  many of which are still ongoing  we currently believe that the ultimate savings realized will not differ materially from our initial estimate 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of certain assets of digilab  llc the digilab business in september  the company recorded a one time pretax charge of million for purchased in process research and development relating to several new digilab business products that were in process at the time of the acquisition 
no such charges were recorded during fiscal year interest income 
interest income was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in interest income in fiscal year resulted primarily from higher levels of invested cash and some increase in interest rates on invested cash 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was in both fiscal year and fiscal year  and the estimated annual effective income tax rate is expected to remain at in fiscal year excluding any discrete items 
however  the company currently anticipates recording a discrete  one time reduction in income tax expense during the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of a change in the treatment of foreign tax credits under new us law enacted during the quarter 
the amount of this reduction cannot currently be estimated  but could be significant 
net earnings 
net earnings in fiscal year reflect the impact of approximately million in pretax restructuring and other related costs and pretax gains of approximately million relating to the curtailment of defined benefit pension plans in australia and the netherlands these curtailment gains were offset by a related defined benefit plan settlement loss of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal year 
net earnings in fiscal year included approximately million in pretax restructuring costs 
excluding the impact of these items  the increase in net earnings resulted primarily from increased sales

the revenue growth in scientific instruments was primarily driven by increased sales of chromatography  spectroscopy  and high end nmr systems into life science applications  the impact of a stronger euro  and the acquisition of ansys technologies  inc ansys in february and the non clinical  drugs of abuse testing business the dat business from roche diagnostics corporation in january earnings from operations include million of pretax restructuring costs in fiscal year and a one time pretax charge of million for purchased in process research and development relating to the acquisition of ansys in fiscal year in addition  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets relating to the scientific instruments segment increased to million  compared to million in fiscal year  as a result of the ansys and dat business acquisitions 
excluding the impact of these costs  the decrease in operating earnings as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from lower gross profit margins and increased general and administrative expenses 
vacuum technologies 
vacuum technologies sales increased primarily as a result of higher sales of products into life science applications in fiscal year vacuum technologies operating earnings for fiscal year include pretax restructuring costs of million and a pretax patent suit settlement of million 
excluding the impact of these costs  the decrease in operating earnings as a percentage of sales in fiscal year resulted primarily from increased spending on research and development  legal expenses relating to the patent suit  and some impact of a weaker us dollar 
electronics manufacturing 
the increase in electronics manufacturing sales in fiscal year was due primarily to approximately million in revenue from new customers obtained through an acquisition completed during the third quarter of fiscal year and increased sales to industrial customers 
operating earnings for fiscal year reflect million in pretax acquisition related transition costs 
excluding the impact of these costs  the increase in operating earnings as a percentage of sales in fiscal year was due to improved operational efficiencies in fiscal year 
table of contents consolidated results the following table presents comparisons of our sales and other selected consolidated financial results for fiscal years and fiscal year ended october  september  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions  except per share data sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative purchased in process research and development total operating expenses operating earnings interest income interest expense income tax expense net earnings net earnings per diluted share sales 
as shown above  fiscal year sales by the scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing segments increased by   and  respectively  compared to fiscal year these increases were partially attributable to the longer fiscal year which comprised weeks compared to fiscal year which comprised weeks 
geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million  and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases decreases of   and  respectively  as compared to fiscal year the decrease in north america resulted primarily from a shift in nmr system sales from north america to europe and the pacific rim 
this decrease was partially offset by higher sales in north america by the rest of the scientific instruments segment 
the increase in europe was primarily the result of stronger scientific instruments sales  due in part to the stronger euro 
the increase in the rest of the world was primarily driven by continued growth in scientific instrument sales into the pacific rim 
gross profit 
the slight increase in gross profit percentage from in fiscal year to in fiscal year was driven primarily by an increase in the gross profit margin for electronics manufacturing due to improved operational efficiencies 
this increase was partially offset by increased sales of newer leading edge scientific instruments products  which had lower margins due to higher installation and warranty costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were of sales in both fiscal year and fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars resulted primarily from the acquisition of ansys in february and the dat business in january the increase was also attributable to costs associated with higher revenues as well as the weaker us dollar  which increased costs for most sales and marketing resources based in non us locations 
research and development 
research and development expenses were of sales in fiscal year  compared to of sales in fiscal year research and development expenses increased as a percentage of sales primarily because the company continued to increase its focus within the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments on new product development with an emphasis on life 
table of contents science applications 
the weaker us dollar also contributed to the increase  as costs relating to certain non us based research and development resources were higher 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year primarily as a result of higher expenses related to acquired businesses  higher insurance and corporate compliance costs  pretax restructuring costs of million  and a pretax patent suit settlement of million 
in addition  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets increased to million in fiscal year  compared to million in the prior year  as a result of the ansys and dat business acquisitions 
restructuring activities 
during fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to improve efficiency and more closely align employee skill sets and other resources with our evolving product mix as a result of our continued emphasis on nmr  mass spectroscopy  and consumable products  with a bias toward life science applications 
in addition  actions were undertaken to create a more efficient consumable products operation 
these actions primarily impacted the scientific instruments segment and involved the termination of approximately employees principally in our sales and marketing  administration  service  and manufacturing functions  the closure of three sales offices and the consolidation of three consumable products factories into one in southern california 
substantially all of these activities were completed during fiscal year except for the termination of approximately employees  which took place in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  and the southern california facility consolidation  which was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal year and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal year costs relating to these restructuring activities have been included in general and administrative expenses 
the following tables set forth changes in the company s liability relating to the foregoing restructuring plan during fiscal year fiscal year ended october  employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges to expense cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at october  purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of ansys in february  the company recorded a one time pretax charge of million for purchased in process research and development relating to several ansys products that were in process at the time of the acquisition 
no such charges were recorded during fiscal year income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to excluding the impact of the purchased in process research and development charge for fiscal year the fiscal year rate was lower than the fiscal year rate due mainly to a reduction in tax rates and higher tax credits in certain foreign jurisdictions 
net earnings 
net earnings for fiscal year reflect the impact of pretax restructuring costs of million and a pretax patent suit settlement of million  while net earnings for fiscal year include the impact of a one time pretax charge of million for purchased in process research and development relating to the ansys acquisition 
excluding the effect of these costs  the increase in net earnings in fiscal year was primarily the result of increased profitability in the scientific instruments and electronics manufacturing segments  partially offset by lower profitability in the vacuum technologies segment and higher corporate costs 
certain subsequent events acquisition of magnex scientific limited 
on november   we acquired magnex scientific limited magnex for approximately million in cash and assumed net debt  subject to certain net 
table of contents asset adjustments 
the transaction also includes an opportunity for additional purchase price payments of up to million over a three year period  depending on the performance of the magnex business relative to certain financial targets 
magnex designs  develops  manufactures  sells  and services superconducting magnets for human and other magnetic resonance mr imaging  nuclear magnetic resonance nmr  and fourier transform mass spectroscopy ftms  and gradients for mr microscopy 
these magnets are used in our nmr and mr imaging systems  and are also sold to original equipment manufacturers oems and end users 
through the magnex acquisition  we gained control of the production of certain magnets used in our existing nmr and mr imaging systems  which is expected to help reduce the cost of these systems in the future 
in addition  we expect to be able to better coordinate the design and development of new nmr and mr imaging products with the design and the development of magnets for those products 
while the magnex business presents these opportunities  it will also present us with new challenges 
these challenges include ensuring that we maintain sources of supply of specialized superconducting wire  which is available from a limited number of external suppliers 
in addition  superconducting magnets are complex  can be difficult to manufacture  are often intended for use in leading edge research applications  and can only be tested after being manufactured 
manufacturing of these magnets also involves long lead times  and customer acceptance can be dependent upon specific acceptance criteria  which can make it difficult for us to forecast shipment  installation  and acceptance of  and installation and warranty costs on  superconducting magnets and our nmr and mr imaging systems that use those magnets 
this can in turn make it difficult for us to forecast the timing of revenue recognition and the achieved gross profit margin on these magnets and our systems in which they are used 
the magnex business became part of our scientific instruments segment 
we will complete our allocation of the purchase price paid for magnex following the completion of the closing balance sheet  a valuation of acquired intangible assets  and certain other matters 
this is currently expected to occur by the end of the fiscal quarter ending december  uk field support administration restructuring 
in october  in connection with our announcement of the definitive agreement to acquire magnex  we committed to a plan to rationalize our field support administration in the united kingdom 
the objective of the plan is to achieve operational efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs resulting from the magnex acquisition 
the plan will involve the termination of approximately employees  the consolidation of certain field support administrative functions currently located in our walton  uk location to magnex s location in oxford  uk  and the closure of the walton facility 
we expect the plan to result in pretax restructuring charges of approximately million to million 
these amounts are comprised of approximately  to  relating primarily to employee terminations and approximately million to million relating primarily to lease termination costs associated with the planned closure of the walton  uk facility 
these amounts include approximately  in non cash charges 
we anticipate that all restructuring charges will be recorded by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year and will be settled between the first quarter of fiscal year and the fourth quarter of fiscal year all actions under the plan are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year in addition to the restructuring charges outlined above  we also expect to incur other one time pretax costs of approximately  to  relating to the plan 
these amounts are primarily comprised of anticipated facility and personnel relocation costs 
including these other restructuring related costs  we anticipate that total future expenditures related to the plan will be approximately million to million 
once completed  the estimated annual cost savings realized as a result of this restructuring plan before any reinvestment of those savings are expected to be between million and million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to exercise certain judgments in selecting and applying accounting policies and methods 
following is a summary of what we consider to be our most 
table of contents critical accounting policies those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments the effects of those accounting policies applied  and the judgments made in their application 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from three primary sources product sales  accessory sales  and services 
we recognize revenue on product sales and accessory sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the product or accessory has been delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
product sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  but that do involve installation services  are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the larger of the contractual billing holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and subsequently recognized when the installation is complete 
for certain other product sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is deferred until all contractually required customer acceptance provisions and product specifications have been satisfied 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
revenue related to incident based paid service and training services is recognized when the related services are provided to the customer 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer 
sales arrangements involving undelivered elements are primarily confined to the scientific instruments segment and involve product accessories  installation services  and or training services that are delivered after the related product has been delivered 
product accessories generally enhance the functionality of the product but are not essential to the functionality of the product 
in determining relative fair values for product accessories and training services  we utilize published price list values as the basis for allocating the overall arrangement consideration 
list prices are representative of fair value  as stand alone sales of products  product accessories  and training have occurred at list price 
the fair value of installation services is calculated by applying standard service billing rates to the estimate of the number of hours to install a specific product based on historical experience 
estimates of installation hours have historically been accurate 
in limited cases  product accessories ordered by customers may not have an established list price  as the item may be a new or slightly modified accessory with no prior sales history 
in these limited cases  we consider whether a comparable or substitute accessory that provides similar functionality exists for which fair value has been established and then use that comparable or substitute accessory s list price in estimating the fair value of the undelivered elements 
if such conditions do not exist  all arrangement revenue is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered  however  such cases are infrequent and arise from a significant technological advance that creates products or product accessories without a suitable comparable or substitute accessory from which to derive fair value 
we determine when and how much revenue may be recognized on a particular transaction in a particular period based on our best estimates of the fair value of undelivered elements and our judgment of when our performance obligations have been met as outlined above 
these judgments and estimates impact reported revenues 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we sell our products and extend trade credit to a large number of customers 
these customers are dispersed across many different industries and geographies and  historically  no single customer has accounted for or more of our total revenues 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral from them 
although bad debt write offs have historically been insignificant  allowances are established for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible 
these allowances represent our best estimates and are based on our judgment after considering a number of factors including third party credit reports  actual payment history  customer specific financial information  and broader market and economic trends and conditions 
in the event that actual uncollectible amounts differ from these best estimates  changes in allowances for doubtful accounts might become necessary 

table of contents inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being computed on an average cost basis 
provisions are made to write down potentially excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventories to their net realizable value 
these provisions are based on our best estimates after considering historical demand  projected future demand including current backlog  inventory purchase commitments  industry and market trends and conditions  and other factors 
in the event that actual excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventories differ from these best estimates  changes to inventory reserves might become necessary 
product warranty 
our products are generally subject to warranties  and liabilities are therefore established for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement through charges to cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized 
these liabilities are adjusted based on our best estimates of future warranty costs after considering historical and projected product failure rates and product repair costs 
in the event that actual experience differs from these best estimates  changes in our warranty liabilities might become necessary 
environmental liabilities 
as discussed more fully below under the heading risk factors environmental matters  under the terms of the distribution  we and vsea are each obligated to indemnify vms for one third of certain environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs 
the liabilities recorded by us relating to these matters are based on our best estimates after considering currently available information regarding the cost and timing of remediation efforts  related legal matters  insurance recoveries  and other environmental related events 
as additional information becomes available  these amounts are adjusted accordingly 
should the cost or timing of remediation efforts  legal matters  insurance recoveries  or other environmental related events including any which may be currently unidentified differ from our current expectations and best estimates  changes to our reserves for environmental matters might become necessary 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our income tax expense 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on our best estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
these reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances 
our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes and the tax impact of foreign operations 
in the future  effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries having lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries having higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal year  which compares to million in fiscal year the decrease in cash from operating activities resulted primarily from the relative changes in accounts receivable million and inventories million  partially offset by higher net earnings million 
cash flows from tax benefits from nonqualified stock option exercises and higher income tax related accrued liabilities were substantially offset by those from increases in net deferred tax assets in fiscal year cash usage relating to accounts receivable in fiscal year of million was primarily attributable to higher sales volume and an increase in the average number of days accounts receivable were outstanding during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents compared to the same quarter of the prior fiscal year 
this increase primarily resulted from the fact that the fourth quarter of fiscal year comprised thirteen weeks  compared to fourteen weeks in the fourth quarter of fiscal year cash generated from accounts receivable in fiscal year of million was primarily due to a significant improvement in the average number of days accounts receivable were outstanding during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  primarily as a result of the extra week included in that period when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year the relative increase in inventory in fiscal year was the result of our need to support higher sales and order volume for our products  which led us to maintain more inventory  and the timing of magnet purchases and deliveries for nmr and mr imaging systems 
inventory turnover for the two periods was relatively constant 
the company used million of cash for investing activities in fiscal year  which compares to usage of million in fiscal year the decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in payments made relating to acquisitions during fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
in particular  amounts paid in fiscal for the acquisition of the dat business from roche diagnostics corporation exceeded amounts paid in fiscal for the acquisition of the digilab business by approximately million 
lower net purchases of property  plant  and equipment also contributed to the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal year the company used million of cash for financing activities in fiscal year  which compares to usage of million in fiscal year the increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to higher cash expenditures to repurchase and retire common stock 
the increased level of stock repurchases in fiscal year was the result of an effort to utilize excess cash to offset increases in our outstanding common shares due to higher stock option exercise volume 
the impact of these stock repurchases on our cash balance was partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to stock option exercises 
during fiscal year  we established a three year unsecured revolving bank credit facility in the amount of million for working capital purposes 
no amounts were borrowed under this credit facility 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we determined that our current liquidity position and the short remaining term of the credit facility no longer justified the cost of maintaining the facility 
as a result  the facility was terminated in january costs incurred in connection with the termination of this facility were not significant and were expensed during the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we established a short term bank credit facility in japan in the amount of million yen approximately million at october  
the credit facility is available to our wholly owned japanese subsidiary for working capital purposes 
as of october   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility and million yen approximately million was available for future borrowing 
this credit facility contains certain covenants that limit future borrowings under this facility  with which we were in compliance at october  in addition to these bank credit facilities  as of october   we had a total of million in other uncommitted and unsecured credit facilities for working capital purposes with interest rates to be established at the time of borrowing 
no borrowings were outstanding under these credit facilities as of october  all of these credit facilities contain certain customary conditions and events of default  with which we were in compliance at october  of the million in uncommitted and unsecured credit facilities  a total of million was limited for use by  or in favor of  certain subsidiaries at october   and a total of million of this million was being utilized in the form of bank guarantees or short term standby letters of credit 
these guarantees and letters of credit related primarily to advance payments or deposits made to our subsidiaries by customers for which separate liabilities were recorded in the consolidated financial statements at october  no amounts had been drawn by beneficiaries under these or any other outstanding guarantees or letters of credit as of that date 
as of october   we had million in term loans outstanding compared to million at october  as of both october  and october   fixed interest rates on the term loans ranged from to 
the weighted average interest rate on the term loans was at both october  and october  the term loans contain certain covenants that limit future borrowings and the payment of cash dividends and require the maintenance of certain levels of working capital and operating 
table of contents results 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the term loan agreements at october  we also had other long term notes payable of million as of october  with a weighted average interest rate of and million as of october  with a weighted average interest rate of 
in connection with the acquisition of the digilab business  we have accrued but not yet paid a portion of the purchase price amount that has been retained to secure the sellers indemnification obligations 
this retained amount  which is due to be paid during fiscal year net of any indemnification claims  totaled approximately million at october  in addition to this retained payment  we are  from time to time  obligated to pay additional cash purchase price amounts in the event that certain financial or operational milestones are met by the acquired businesses 
as of october   up to a maximum of million could be payable through fiscal year under these contingent consideration arrangements 
of this maximum amount  a total of million relates to the digilab business acquisition and can be earned if acquired product lines reach specific financial performance targets through fiscal year the remaining million relates to the acquisition of bear instruments  inc in fiscal year and can be earned if acquired product lines reach specific financial performance targets through fiscal year any contingent payments made will be recorded as additional goodwill at the time they are earned 
see also the discussion above under the heading certain subsequent events  which describes our acquisition of magnex after october the distribution agreement provides that the company is responsible for certain litigation to which vai was a party  and further provides that the company will indemnify vms and vsea for one third of the costs  expenses  and other liabilities relating to certain discontinued  former  and corporate operations of vai  including certain environmental liabilities see below under the heading risk factors environmental matters and governmental regulations 
as of october   we had cancelable commitments to a contractor for capital expenditures totaling approximately million relating to the ongoing consolidation of three consumable products factories into one in southern california 
in the event that these commitments are canceled for reasons other than the contractor s default  we may be responsible for reimbursement of actual costs incurred by the contractor 
we had no material non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures as of october  in the aggregate  we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be between million and million during fiscal year our liquidity is affected by many other factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry in which we compete and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our current cash balance and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next months 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes future principal payments on outstanding debt and minimum rentals due for certain facilities and other leased assets under long term  non cancelable operating leases as of october  fiscal year thereafter total in thousands operating leases long term debt including current portion total contractual cash obligations

we adopted the new disclosure requirements of sfas as revised  which were effective for fiscal years ending after december   in fiscal year in december  the sec issued sab  revenue recognition  which supercedes sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in sab related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superceded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s faq issued with sab that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
selected portions of the faq have been incorporated into sab while the wording of sab differs from sab to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab we adopted the provisions of sab in fiscal year and the provisions of eitf in fiscal year as a result  the issuance of sab had no impact on our revenue recognition policy or our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act 
the act introduced a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of post retirement health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare part d benefit 
fsp becomes effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  and supersedes fsp  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which was issued in january fsp provides authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy provided under the act and specifies the disclosure requirements for employers who have adopted fsp  including those who are unable to determine whether benefits provided under its plan are actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
the adoption of fsp  which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued a proposed amendment to sfas  earnings per share  to make it consistent with international accounting standard  earnings per share  so as to make earnings per share computations comparable on a global basis 
as currently drafted  the amendment would require companies to use the year to date average stock price to compute the number of treasury shares that could theoretically be purchased with the proceeds from exercise of share contracts such as options or warrants 
the current method of calculating earnings per share requires companies to calculate an average of the potential incremental common shares computed for each quarter when computing year to date incremental shares 
the proposed amendment would also change other aspects of sfas that would not impact our earnings per share calculations 
the amended standard is expected to be issued by december  and 
table of contents would be effective for all periods ending after december  should the proposed statement be finalized in its current form including the proposed effective date  its adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued a proposed standard  share based payment  an amendment of fasb statements nos 
and  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of that company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of that company s equity instruments  or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the proposed standard would eliminate companies ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally would require that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of earnings 
in its current form  the proposed standard would require companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options for financial statement disclosure purposes 
however  we may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate under the standard when it is issued in final form 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the proposed standard that would result in different accounting treatment than currently required  should the proposed standard be implemented in its current form 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options and for stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
as currently proposed  the standard would be effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  should the proposed statement be finalized in its current form  its adoption would have a material impact on our results of operations since we would be required to expense the fair value of stock options granted under our omnibus stock plan and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
risk factors customer demand 
demand for our products depends upon  among other factors  the level of capital expenditures by current and prospective customers  the rate of economic growth in the markets in which we compete  and the competitiveness of our products and services 
changes in any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the case of our scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments  we must continue to assess and predict customer needs  regulatory requirements  and evolving technologies 
we must develop new products  including enhancements to existing products  new services  and new applications  successfully commercialize  manufacture  market  and sell these products  and protect our intellectual property in these products 
if we are unsuccessful in these areas  our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
in the case of our electronics manufacturing segment  we must respond quickly to our customers changing requirements 
customers may change  delay  or cancel orders for many reasons  including lack of success of their products or business strategies and economic conditions in the markets they serve 
in addition  some customers  including start up companies  have limited product histories and financial resources  which make them riskier customers for us 
we must determine  based on our judgment and our customers estimates of their future requirements  what levels of business we will accept  what start up costs to incur for new customers or products  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs  and other resource requirements 
all of these decisions require predictions about the future and judgments that could be wrong 
cancellations  reductions  or delays in orders by a significant customer or group of customers  or their inability to meet financial commitments with respect to orders or shipments  could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
variability of operating results 
we experience some cyclical patterns in sales of our products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of our fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in our first fiscal quarter october to december and many customers defer december deliveries until the next calendar year  our 
table of contents second fiscal quarter 
sales and earnings in our third fiscal quarter are usually flat to down sequentially compared to the second fiscal quarter  primarily because there are a number of holidays in the early part of the quarter  especially in europe  and the june quarter end has no significant customer year ends to influence orders 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including general economic conditions  acquisitions  new product introductions  and products requiring long manufacturing and installation lead times such as nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets 
consequently  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
for most of our products  we operate on a short backlog  as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
we also experience significant shipments in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how our customers place orders and schedule shipments 
this can make it difficult for us to forecast our results of operations 
certain of our leading edge nmr and mr imaging systems  nmr probes  superconducting magnets  and related components sell for high prices and on long lead times 
these systems and components are complex  require development of new technologies and  therefore  significant research and development resources  are often intended for evolving leading edge research applications  often have customer specific features  custom capabilities  and specific acceptance criteria  and  in the case of nmr and mr imaging systems  require superconducting magnets that can be difficult to manufacture 
most superconducting magnets for our leading edge nmr systems are not manufactured by us  so our ability to ship  install  and obtain customer acceptance of our leading edge nmr systems is dependent upon the superconducting magnet supplier s timely development  delivery  and installation of magnets that perform to customer specifications 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  all of these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast shipment  installation  and acceptance of  and installation and warranty costs on  leading edge nmr and mr imaging systems  nmr probes  and superconducting magnets  which in turn can make it difficult for us to forecast the timing of revenue recognition and the achieved gross profit margin on these products 
competition 
the industries in which we operate scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing are highly competitive 
in each of these industries  we compete against many us and us companies  most with global operations 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have  which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  compete on price  or devote greater resources to research and development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales  or managerial activities 
others have greater name recognition and geographic and market presence or lower cost structures than we do 
in addition  weaker demand and excess capacity in our industries could cause greater price competition as our competitors seek to maintain sales volumes and market share 
additionally  in the case of electronics manufacturing  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally  there is substantial excess manufacturing capacity in the industry  certain competitors manufacture or are seeking to manufacture outside the us where there can be significant cost advantages  and certain customers may be willing to move to off shore manufacturing for cost reasons  larger competitors might have greater direct buying power from suppliers  and electronics manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant intellectual property protection 
for all of the foregoing reasons  competition could result in lower revenues due to lost sales or price reductions  lower margins  and loss of market share  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key suppliers 
some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products  including superconducting magnets used in nmr and mr imaging systems and wire used in superconducting magnets  are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
the loss of a key supplier or the inability to obtain certain key raw materials or components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increase our costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we have experienced and could again experience delivery delays in superconducting magnets used in nmr systems  which has caused and could again cause delays in our product shipments 
in addition  end users of our nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets require helium to operate those products  shortages of helium could result in higher helium prices  and thus higher operating costs for nmr and mr imaging systems and superconducting magnets  which could impact demand for those products 
our electronics manufacturing segment uses electronic components in the manufacture of its products 
these components can be more or less difficult and expensive to obtain  depending on the overall demand for these components as a result of general economic cycles or other factors 
consequently  the electronics manufacturing segment s results of operations could fluctuate over time 
business interruption 
our facilities  operations  and systems could be impacted by fire  flood  terrorism  or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  we have significant facilities in areas prone to earthquakes and fires  such as our production facilities and headquarters in california 
due to their limited availability  broad exclusions  and prohibitive costs  we do not have insurance policies that would cover losses resulting from an earthquake 
if any of our facilities or surrounding areas were to be significantly damaged in an earthquake or fire  it could disrupt our operations  delay shipments  and cause us to incur significant repair or replacement costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our employees based in certain foreign countries are subject to factory specific and or industry wide collective bargaining agreements 
of these  certain of our employees in australia are subject to a collective bargaining agreement that will need to be renewed in april a work stoppage  strike  or other labor action at this or other of our facilities could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
intellectual property 
our success depends on our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements  and licensing arrangements to establish and protect that intellectual property  but these protections might not be available in all countries  might not be enforceable  might not fully protect our intellectual property  and might not provide meaningful competitive advantages 
moreover  we might be required to spend significant resources to police and enforce our intellectual property rights  and we might not detect infringements of those intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
other third parties might claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights that we are infringing 
any litigation regarding intellectual property of others could be costly and could divert personnel and resources from our operations 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to develop non infringing alternatives or enter into royalty bearing license agreements 
we might also be required to pay damages or be enjoined from developing  manufacturing  or selling infringing products 
we sometimes rely on licenses to avoid these risks  but we cannot be assured that these licenses will be available in the future or on favorable terms 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
acquisitions 
we have acquired companies and operations  and intend to acquire companies and operations in the future  as part of our growth strategy 
acquisitions must be carefully evaluated and negotiated if they are to be successful 
once completed  acquired operations must be carefully integrated to realize expected synergies  efficiencies  and financial results 
some of the challenges in doing this include retaining key employees  managing operations in new geographic areas  retaining key customers  and managing transaction costs 
all of this must be done without diverting management and other resources from other operations and activities 
failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate  and integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
restructuring activities 
we have undertaken restructuring activities  and may undertake restructuring activities in the future  that we expect to result in certain costs and eventual cost savings 

table of contents these costs and cost savings are based on estimates at the time of plan commitment as to the timing of activities to be completed and the timing and amount of related costs to be incurred 
we could experience delays in completing restructuring activities and our estimates of the costs to complete these activities could change 
such events could adversely impact the eventual costs of  and savings achieved by  the restructuring activities 
as a result  these risks could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign operations and currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our sales  manufacturing activities  and employees are outside of the united states 
as a result  we are subject to various risks  including the following duties  tariffs  and taxes  restrictions on currency conversions  fund transfers  or profit repatriations  import  export  and other trade restrictions  protective labor regulations and union contracts  compliance with local laws and regulations  travel and transportation difficulties  and adverse developments in political or economic environments in countries where we operate 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  the us dollar value of our sales and operating costs varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because we manufacture and sell in the us and a number of other countries  the impact that currency exchange rate fluctuations have on us is dependent on the interaction of a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the relationships between various foreign currencies  the relative amount of our revenues that are denominated in us dollars or in us dollar linked currencies  customer resistance to currency driven price changes  and the suddenness and severity of changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we hedge most of our balance sheet exposures denominated in other than local currencies based upon forecasts of those exposures  in the event that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  foreign exchange losses could result 
for all of these reasons  currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the us dollar has weakened significantly in relation to other major world currencies including the euro  the british pound  and the japanese yen 
because of the variables detailed in the preceding paragraph  it is difficult to predict whether  and the extent to which  the weaker us dollar will have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key personnel 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of key personnel  including research and development  engineering  manufacturing  finance  administrative  marketing  sales  and management personnel 
the availability of qualified personnel can vary significantly based on factors such as the strength of the general economy 
however  even in weak economic periods  there is still intense competition for personnel with certain expertise in the geographic areas where we compete for personnel 
in addition  certain employees have significant institutional and proprietary technical knowledge  which could be difficult to quickly replace 
failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  who generally do not have employment agreements or post employment non competition agreements  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
certain employee benefit plans 
many of our us employees participate in health care plans under which the company is self insured 
we maintain a stop loss insurance policy that covers the cost of certain individually large claims under these plans 
during each year  our expenses under these plans are recorded based on actuarial estimates of the number and costs of expected claims  administrative costs  and stop loss premiums 
these estimates are then adjusted at the end of each plan year to reflect actual costs incurred 
actual costs under the plan are subject to variability depending primarily upon the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stop loss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims 
in the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we also maintain defined benefit pension plans for our employees in several foreign countries 
in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions  we utilize a number of assumptions including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in order to determine our defined benefit pension plan costs each year 
these assumptions are set based on relevant debt  equity  and other market conditions in the countries in which the plans are maintained 
we adjust these 
table of contents assumptions each year in response to corresponding changes in the underlying market conditions 
changes in these market conditions result in corresponding changes in our defined benefit pension plan assumptions and costs 
these changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
environmental matters 
our operations are subject to various foreign  federal  state  and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of our operations 
however  we do not currently anticipate that our compliance with these regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
as is described above  we and vsea are each obligated pursuant to the terms of the distribution to indemnify vms for one third of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to environmental matters 
in that regard  vms has been named by the us environmental protection agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  at nine sites where vai is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling  treatment  or disposal 
in addition  vms is overseeing and  as applicable  reimbursing third parties for environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation activities under the direction of  or in consultation with  foreign  federal  state  and or local agencies at certain current vms or former vai facilities 
we and vsea are each obligated to indemnify vms for one third of these environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and taxes 
for certain of these sites and facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further environmental related activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken 
as of october   it was nonetheless estimated that our share of the future exposure for environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of october  no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is believed to be more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range  and we therefore had an accrual of million as of october  as to certain sites and facilities  sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to better estimate the scope and certain costs of future environmental related activities 
as of october   it was estimated that our share of the future exposure for these environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of october  as to each of these sites and facilities  it was determined that a particular amount within the range of certain estimated costs was a better estimate of the future environmental related cost than any other amount within the range  and that the amount and timing of these future costs were reliably determinable 
together  the undiscounted amounts for these sites totaled million at october  we therefore had an accrual of million as of october   which represents the best estimate of our share of these future environmental related costs discounted at  net of inflation 
this accrual is in addition to the million described in the preceding paragraph 

table of contents at october   our reserve for environmental related costs  based upon future environmental related costs estimated by us as of that date  was calculated as follows recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future costs in millions fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount less current portion long term included in other liabilities the foregoing amounts are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates 
the aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation  monitoring  and remediation activities and the large number of sites where such investigation  monitoring  and remediation activities are being undertaken 
an insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of certain of vai s now vms future environmental related costs for which we have an indemnification obligation  and we therefore have a million receivable in other assets as of october  for our share of such recovery 
we have not reduced any environmental related liability in anticipation of recoveries from third parties 
management believes that our reserves for the foregoing and other environmental related matters are adequate  but as the scope of our obligation becomes more clearly defined  these reserves may be modified  and related charges against or credits to earnings may be made 
although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that  if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year  would be material to our financial statements  the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote 
based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events  management believes that the costs of environmental related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
governmental regulations 
our businesses are subject to many governmental regulations in the us and other countries  including with respect to protection of the environment  employee health and safety  labor matters  product safety  medical devices  import  export  competition  and sales to governmental entities 
these regulations are complex and change frequently 
we incur significant costs to comply with governmental regulations  costs to comply with new or changed regulations could be significant  and failure to comply could result in suspension of or restrictions on our operations  product recalls  fines  and other civil and criminal penalties  private party litigation  and damage to our reputation  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
from time to time  we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on forecasted transactions 
the success of our hedging activities depends on our ability to forecast balance sheet exposures and transaction activity in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
however  we believe that in most cases any such gains or losses would be substantially offset by losses or gains from the related foreign exchange forward contracts 
we therefore believe that the direct effect of an immediate change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and all other currencies is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
at october   there were no outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
during the fiscal year ended october   no foreign exchange gains or losses from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness were recognized 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally range from one to months in original maturity 
a summary of all foreign exchange forward contracts that were outstanding as of october  follows notional value sold notional value purchased in thousands euro australian dollar japanese yen canadian dollar british pound swedish krona total interest rate risk 
we have no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
we invest any excess cash primarily in short term us treasury securities and money market funds  and changes in interest rates would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we enter into debt obligations principally to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
at october   our debt obligations had fixed interest rates 
based upon rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  the carrying amounts of long term debt and notes payable approximate their estimated fair values 
although payments under certain operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases 
debt obligations principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity fiscal year thereafter total dollars in thousands long term debt including current portion average interest rate defined benefit retirement plans 
most of our retirement plans  including all us based plans  are defined contribution plans 
however  we also provide defined benefit pension plans in certain foreign countries 
our obligations under these defined benefit plans will ultimately be settled in the future and are therefore subject to estimation 
defined benefit pension accounting under sfas  employers accounting 
table of contents for pensions  is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees estimated service periods based on the terms of the pension plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
for our defined benefit pension plans  we make assumptions regarding several variables including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in order to determine defined benefit pension plan expense for the year 
this expense is referred to as net periodic pension cost 
we assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumption for each defined benefit plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by sfas and make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
on an annual basis  we analyze the rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used and determine that these rates are reasonable 
for rates of return  this analysis is based on a review of the nature of the underlying assets  the allocation of those assets and their historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the related plans are effective 
historically  our assumed asset allocations have not varied significantly from the actual allocations 
discount rates are based on the prevailing market long term interest rates in the countries where the related plans are effective 
as of october   the estimated long term rate of return on our defined benefit pension plan assets ranged from to weighted average of  and the assumed discount rate for our defined benefit pension plan obligations ranged from to weighted average of 
if any of these assumptions were to change  our net periodic pension cost would also change 
we incurred net periodic pension cost relating to our defined benefit pension plans of million in fiscal year excluding curtailment gains  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year  and expect our net periodic pension cost excluding any settlement losses to be approximately million in fiscal year a one percent decrease in the weighted average estimated return on plan assets or assumed discount rate would increase our net periodic pension cost for fiscal year by million and million  respectively 
as of october   our projected benefit obligation relating to defined benefit pension plans was million 
a one percent decrease in the weighted average estimated discount rate would increase this obligation by million 
during fiscal year  we ceased future benefit accruals to our existing defined benefit pension plans in australia and the netherlands and commenced contributions to new defined contribution plans for the benefit of their participants 
in connection with these actions  we recorded curtailment gains of approximately million during fiscal year these curtailment gains were offset by a related defined benefit plan settlement loss of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal year
