overview management believes the two factors having the greatest impact on the company s earnings are the sustained low rate environment  and the overall health of the equity and financial markets 
the sustained low interest rate environment adversely impacts the company s net interest income as our balance sheet is structured to be both very short in duration and liquid 
management believes that strong liquidity and capital are necessary given the types of products and services the company offers  particularly as it relates to treasury and cash management products and services 
a strong liquidity and capital position provide assurances that the cash needs of the company can be met 
this position adversely impacts the company s net interest income in a declining rate environment 
however  in an increasing rate environment  this position should benefit the company 
management believes that we will be entering into a period of rising interest rate given the overall expansion of the economy and the size of both the federal and trade deficits 
item a  quantitative disclosures about market risk discusses in detail the impact of rising and declining rates on net interest income 
net interest income is a main source of revenue for the company 
net interest income is negatively impacted by smaller spreads between the yield on earning assets and the interest free sources of funds 
as the yields on loans and investments declined  interest free sources of funds could not  by definition  be lowered to match the decrease in yield on earning assets 
in addition  a competitive deposit pricing environment prevented the lowering of rates on interest bearing deposits to match the decrease in yields on earning assets 
a sustained low rate environment will continue to put pressure on the company s net interest income 
table appearing in the results of operations net interest income section of the management s discussion and analysis shows the impact of the declining rate environment and also shows the declining benefits derived from the company s interest free source of funds 
management continues to focus on diversifying the revenue sources so that the net income of the company is less susceptible to changes in interest rates 
management has also focused on reducing expenses that are not necessary to the delivery of products and services to the company s customer base 
as some of the company s fee based business is the direct result of the market value of its customer s investments  the overall health of the equity and financial markets plays an important role in the recognition of fee income  particularly in the trust  mutual fund servicing and investment management areas of the company 
as the overall equity and financial markets improve  the basis on which certain fee income is calculated should grow 
the company s goal is to differentiate itself from its large super regional and national competitors through superior service  attention to detail  customer knowledge and responsiveness 
the company s size allows it to meet this goal and at the same time offer the wide range of products most customers need 
this strategy has worked especially well during a period of bank consolidation and should continue to be a benefit 
the company has experienced growth in the new markets it entered during and there has been a demand in these markets for bank services delivered with a customer centric focus 
the company will continue to focus its efforts to attract a customer base that values the advantages of banking with a company headquartered in their market while still possessing the products and services of a much larger institution 
earnings summary the company recorded consolidated net income of million for the year ended december  this represents a increase over net income for decreased compared to earnings per share for the year ended december   were per share compared to in and in earnings per share for increased over per share earnings  which had decreased over the federal reserve board reduced the interest rate times in for a total of basis points and an additional basis points in and basis points in these reductions caused repricing pressures on loans and securities and thus contributed significantly to a decrease in interest income for and although  this decrease in interest income was positively offset by a decrease in interest expense  the company s net interest income declined to million in compared to million in and million in the company had an increase of in noninterest income in as compared to and a increase in compared to in  the company sold its merchant discount operation  which processes credit and debit card activity for commercial and retail merchants  for million

the decrease in compared to was due to a year end charge in of approximately million related to the write off of certain non strategic assets  primarily real estate 
amortization of goodwill was also discontinued in due to the issuance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
this change in accounting standards resulted in a reduction of expense of million in the results of operations for the period january  through may  were affected by the consolidation of the company s subsidiary escout llc escout 
the sale of a portion of the company s ownership in escout which operates now as perfect commerce subsequent to a merger for a gain of million  on may  put the company in a minority ownership position 
the results of escout are no longer included in the consolidated results of the company 
results of operations net interest income net interest income is a significant source of the company s earnings and represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds the interest expense paid on liabilities 
the volume of interest earning assets and the related funding sources  the overall mix of these assets and liabilities and the rates paid on each  affects net interest income 
table summarizes the change in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and rates for  and table also shows the impact of the declining rate environment on net interest income over the last three years 
net interest margin is calculated as net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis fte as a percentage of average earning assets 
a critical component of net interest income and related net interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest free funding sources 
table analyzes net interest rate margin for the three years ended december   and table also shows the decline in the benefit of interest free funds as a result of the declining interest rate environment over the last three years 
net interest income  average balance sheet amounts and the corresponding yields earned and rates paid for the years through are presented in a table following the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest income is presented on a tax equivalent basis to adjust for the tax exempt status of earnings from certain loans and investments  which are primarily obligations of state and local governments 
table rate volume analysis in thousands this analysis attributes changes in net interest income either to changes in average balances or to changes in average rates for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the change in net interest income is due jointly to both volume and rate and has been allocated to volume and rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amount of the change in each

these decreases in net interest income have occurred due to several factors  primarily a reduction in demand for loans due to the soft economy  a reduction in mutual fund and trust related money market balances largely driven by both economic factors and a residual lack of public confidence impacting the overall securities industry  and an earning asset portfolio that  by design  is very short in duration and has been negatively impacted by the overall decline in interest rates over the past three years 
management believes that the overall outlook in its net interest income is positive 
in the short term  a recovering economy is expected to spur higher demand for commercial and consumer loans 
loan related earning assets tend to have a higher spread than those earned in the company s investment portfolio 
in addition  over the next several quarters  most economists believe that interest rates will rise 
given the term of our earning assets  a rising rate environment would have a positive impact on the company s net interest income 
finally  management is undertaking a strategic initiative to focus additional efforts on marketing  product enhancements and streamlining the approval process for its consumer loan product suite 
these efforts should result in increased volumes of new applications and booked loans 
provision and allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses all represents management s judgment of the losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust its all to the level considered appropriate by management 
the adequacy of the all is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical loss trends  a review of individual loans  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics  industry or segment concentration and other factors 
bank regulatory agencies require that the adequacy of the all be maintained on a bank by bank basis for each of the company s subsidiaries 
the company utilizes a centralized credit administration function  which provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure 
in addition  loan requests are centrally reviewed to ensure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards 
management of the company increased the all from of total loans as of december  to of total loans as of december  and of total loans as of december  this increase was due to an increase in nonperforming loans in and increased charge offs in caused by the overall softening of the economy in the region that the company serves 
as shown in table  the all has been allocated to various loan portfolio segments 
the company manages the all against the risk in the entire loan portfolio and therefore  the allocation of the all to a particular loan segment may change in the future 
in the opinion of management  the all is appropriate based on the inherent losses in the loan portfolio at december  although no assurance can be given  management of the company believes the present all is adequate considering the company s loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions

fee based services provide the opportunity to offer multiple products and services to customers and  therefore  more closely align the customer with the company 
the company s ongoing focus is to develop and offer multiple products and services to its customers  the quality of which will differentiate it from the competition 
fee based services that have been emphasized include trust and securities processing  securities trading brokerage and cash management 
management believes that it can offer these products and services both efficiently and profitably as most of these are driven off of common platforms and support structures 
table summary of noninterest income in thousands year ended december trust and securities processing trading and investment banking service charge on deposit accounts other service charges and fees bankcard fees gains on sales of securities available for sale  net other total noninterest income noninterest income summarized in table increased in compared to an increase of in the increase in was primarily a result of an increase in trading and investment banking  service charges on deposit accounts and other income 
the growth in was driven by an increase in trust and securities processing and an increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
trust and securities processing consists of fees earned on personal and corporate trust accounts  custody of securities services  trust investments and money management services and servicing of mutual fund assets 
these fees decreased in compared to part of this decrease was caused by the decline in equity and financial markets as trust fees are derived from the market value of the assets in the trust 
in addition  due to the overall market decline in mutual fund volumes  fees relating to the custody of the securities and the servicing of mutual fund assets were negatively impacted 
in addition  the mutual fund servicing industry as a whole has been negatively impacted by the continuing accusations of irregularities within some segments of the industry 
the increase in fees in compared to was primarily due to the increase in the servicing of mutual fund assets 
this was primarily driven by the acquisition of sunstone financial group  inc now known as umb fund services  inc 
during the second quarter partially offsetting the increase in fees was a decline in trust fees caused by the decline in equity markets as mentioned above 
management of the company believes that the current rebound in the securities market is beginning to have a positive impact as fees increased million for the three months ended december   compared to the same period in if the securities market and public and market confidence in mutual funds continue to rebound  as is anticipated by most analysts  the company s fees for custody of securities and the servicing of mutual fund assets would increase 
in addition  management believes that the overall quality and performance of both its investment management and scout funds will attract both increased and new investable dollars to it assets under management 
management is also introducing a wrap product which will allow our brokerage operations to sell our scout funds to retail clients 
finally  the company has put a special emphasis on selling the scout funds through our institutional channels by the establishment of a dedicated sales force 
the company entered into an agreement in to sell certain employee benefit accounts 
the company services these accounts in an employee benefit plan recordkeeping and trustee capacity 
the transfer of these accounts is expected to be complete in the first quarter of the sale of the company s employee benefit accounts will likely offset a portion of such potential increase in revenues 
trading and investment banking consists mostly of fees earned from the sale of bonds to the company s correspondent banking market and throughout its brokerage operations 
fees increased million in compared to and were flat in compared to the increase was mainly market driven as customers took advantage of rate opportunities within their respective portfolios 
fees and service charges on deposit accounts increased million in compared to and million in compared to the increase in fees was primarily related to new corporate deposit relationships and the sale of additional cash management services 
corporate service charge fees also increased due to lower compensating balances maintained by corporate customers and the lower earnings credit rate allowed on those balances 
an increase in the interest rate would have a negative impact on fees within this business sector 
however  management believes that the overall economic recovery should increase the company s number of cash management customers and the corresponding number of transactions in customer accounts which would offset any adverse impact in fees caused by a rise in interest rates 
bankcard fees increased million in compared to and million in compared to the increase was primarily due to higher merchant discount income partially offset by a slight decline in atm interchange fees 
the company has sold its debit credit card discount operation and anticipates a reduction of million in bankcard fees in interchange fees are expected to continue to decline as a result of recently settled industry lawsuit involving master card and visa 
management is actively streamlining the approval process and adding increased functionality within its card base in order to increase the volume of cards used 
other income increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the increase in was due to the sale of the merchant discount operation for an million gain 
included in was a million gain on the sale of part of the company s ownership in escout 
noninterest expense noninterest expense in decreased million compared to primarily due to lower salary and benefits costs  and decreased million in compared to due to lower equipment expenses and suspension of goodwill amortization 
included in expenses were million in charges related to the operations of escout  llc escout  a partially owned subsidiary of the company 
while the results of escout s operations impact various non interest income and expense categories of the company s consolidated statements of income  under the terms of its limited liability operating document  the net results of operation of this subsidiary are allocated to outside minority investors  and therefore  eliminated through an adjustment to minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary 
table summary of noninterest expense year ended december salaries and employee benefits occupancy  net equipment supplies and services marketing and business development processing fees legal and consulting amortization of goodwill on purchased affiliates amortization of intangibles other total noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits declined million in compared to and increased million in compared to the increase in staffing costs in was primarily due to higher medical insurance premiums 
the decline in salaries represented roughly half of the overall decrease in  primarily due to lower staffing levels reflecting a concerted effort on the part of management to decrease overhead costs 
this was a continuation of the decrease in staffing levels 
to illustrate  the company s full time equivalent employees dropped from  at year end  to  at year end to  at year end this decrease in salary expense is expected to continue as the company is committed to becoming more efficient 
in addition  as the sale of our employee benefit accounts to marshall isley trust company  na is completed during the first quarter of  the company expects to garner additional salary and benefit related savings 
occupancy expense remained flat for the three year period equipment costs decreased million in compared to and million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower depreciation and equipment maintenance costs 
management expects these expenses to increase somewhat in  due to conversion and upgrading of some of our mainframe computer systems 
processing fees increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to the increase in was due to an increase in federal reserve processing charges because of the decreased earnings credit on balances and increased volumes of activity 
amortization of goodwill on purchased affiliates was discontinued effective january  in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
please see critical accounting policies and summary of accounting policies on page of this report for additional details 
other expense increased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to included in the expense was million in impairment charges related to the write off and disposition of certain non strategic assets  primarily real estate 
income taxes income tax expense totaled million in  compared to million in  compared to million in these expense levels equate to effective rates of  and for  and respectively 
the primary reason for the difference between the company s effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is the effect of non taxable income from municipal securities 
the amount of municipal interest income received did not decrease proportionately to the decrease in the company s pretax income in causing a reduction in the effective tax rate 
in and  the company did not recognize nondeductible goodwill amortization pursuant to changes in financial accounting standards which also caused the effective tax rate to be lower than the effective income tax rate for and includes a reduction in the tax reserve resulting from a reassessment of ongoing risks associated with tax matters 
strategic lines of business the company s operations are strategically aligned into four major lines of business commercial banking  retail banking  trust and wealth management  and  investment services group 
the lines of business are differentiated by the products and services offered 
the treasury and other category includes items not directly associated with the other lines of business 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes how these segments were identified and presents financial results of the lines of business for the years ended december   and commercial banking s net income increased million  or three percent  to million in  compared to a decrease of million  or twenty percent to million in for  the increase in net income was driven primarily by an increase in noninterest income resulting from strong sales of cash management products and services 
a lower provision for loan losses  due to a reduction in non performing loans  also contributed to the improvement in net income 
net interest income declined in due to the sustained low rate environment and the corresponding impact on repricing of earning assets 
for  the net income decrease was due primarily to the decrease in net interest income resulting from a significant decrease in rates during an increase in interest rates  as expected by most economists  would have the most significant impact on this business segment  causing net interest income to rise 
because deposit service charges are also affected by interest rates due to the earnings credit on commercial accounts  noninterest income is expected to decrease in a rising rate environment 
management believes the decrease in deposit service charges would be more than offset by the increase in net interest income 
management also believes that an anticipated improving economy would spur an increase in both loan commitments and outstandings which would generate increased net interest income 
retail banking s net income decreased million to a net loss of million  compared to a decrease of million or sixty nine percent to million in for  the decrease in net income was primarily due to a decrease in the net interest income resulting from the sustained low rate environment 
retail banking is a source of funding for other activities within the company 
due to the competitive nature of deposit pricing within the company s markets  the company s affiliates and subsidiaries were unable to continue to lower deposit rates to keep pace with the decreases in earning asset yields and still remain competitive 
for  the net income decrease was due primarily to the increase in noninterest expense resulting from increased costs related to a new residential mortgage product  increased advertising expense  and increased expenses related to new loan software purchased in the greatest potential for improving net income for this business segment lies in the continued focus on offering products and services in the most efficient manner and by booking more loans through the branch structure 
management s intent is to aggressively market its home equity line of credit  direct auto loans and credit card products to more efficiently optimize its branch network as a source of earning assets 
trust and wealth management net income increased million or ninety eight percent to million in  compared to an increase of million  or thirty five percent to million in for  increased sales of trust products and services resulted in an increase in noninterest income 
a decrease in noninterest expense  through reduced salaries and benefits and reduced advertising expense  also contributed to improved net income 
for  increased sales of trust products and services were the primary reason for the increase in net income 
this was offset by lower net interest income resulting from significant rate decreases in the company sold its employee benefit account processing in management does not believe that the sale of the employee benefit account processing will have an impact on the net income of this business segment due to the comparable revenues and expenses related to this activity 
the greatest impact for earnings improvement in this business segment lies in continued increased sales of products and services and improved equity and financial markets  since most revenues are related to the market value of customer investments 
investment services group net income decreased million or twenty seven percent to million in  compared to an increase of million  or seven percent to million in for  decreased revenues related to a sluggish mutual fund industry had the greatest impact on earnings 
for  custody and cash management activities for mutual fund customers provided an increase to noninterest income  but were offset by lower net interest income caused by significant interest rate decreases in improvement in the equity and financial markets  and in particular improvements in the mutual fund industry  would provide the greatest opportunity for improved earnings for this business segment 
management believes that the company has a distinct advantage over its competitors by being able to provide the full range of services to mutual fund providers under one umbrella 
the net loss for the treasury and other category was million for  compared to a net loss of million for the net loss for all years includes unallocated income tax expense for the consolidated company 
the smaller loss in was due primarily to the gain on the sale of the merchant discount processing activity which appears as noninterest income in for  the net loss decreased due to lower income tax expense 
the amounts include net interest income  noninterest income and noninterest expense related to  and offset by  minority interest in loss of a consolidated subsidiary which was sold in may and no longer has any affect on the earnings of the company 
balance sheet analysis loans loans represent the company s largest source of interest income 
loan balances have now stabilized due to management s effort to focus on new commercial and consumer loan relationships  as well as the overall improvement in the economy 
management plans to continue to focus on growing our consumer and middle market business as these market niches represent our best opportunity to cross sell fee related services  such as cash management 
in addition  management intends to develop a small business initiative as this segment represents a growth opportunity for the company 
with both the recent hiring of peter de silva as president and chief operating officer of the company and the establishment of a management committee to run the day to day operations of the company  r 
crosby kemper iii  the chairman and chief executive officer  and other members of the commercial banking division s management team  will focus more on acquiring new customers and selling our products and services 
included in table is a five year breakdown of loans by type 
during the first quarter of the company reviewed the classifications of loans to ensure that loans were properly recorded on the loan system  which resulted in the reclassification of million in loans from the commercial category to the commercial real estate category 
business related loans continue to represent the largest segment of the company s loan portfolio  comprising approximately of total loans 
the lending focus of the company and each of its affiliate banks is on small to medium sized commercial companies located within their respective trade areas 
the company targets customers that will utilize multiple banking services and products

bankcard loans have declined as a percentage of total loans 
they comprise of total loans at year end compared to at year end a significant portion of the decrease in volume of bankcard loans in and was caused by a reduction in the private label portion of the portfolio 
this type of loan is generally less profitable than traditional bankcard loans and is likely to continue to decrease in volume 
the overall growth in the company s bankcard portfolio has been hampered by increased competition from banking and non banking card issuers 
competitors frequently lessen their credit standards and offer favorable introductory rates in an effort to obtain transfer balances from other cards 
the company has historically not elected to seek loan volume in such a manner 
in fact  the company s credit and underwriting standards have become more strict as more consumers acquire multiple credit cards 
however  management plans to further enhance the company s credit scoring matrices and believes the company can attract more of those card customers historically not served by the company without materially affecting the overall risk reward ratio 
other consumer installment loans have increased as a percentage of loans 
they comprise of total loans at year end compared to at year end the increase was due primarily to an increase in the purchase of automobile dealer loans and direct consumer loans to our customers 
with the improving economy  management believes that the volume of these types of loans will continue to increase 
management intends to increase its efforts in acquiring indirect paper with additional staff and a focus on penetration into markets adjacent to our current market area 
real estate residential loans have increased as a percentage of loans

capital and liquidity the company places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position  which promotes investor confidence  provides access to funding sources under favorable terms  and enhances the company s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities 
capital is managed for each subsidiary based upon its respective risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements

risk based capital guidelines established by regulatory agencies establish minimum capital standards based on the level of risk associated with a financial institution s assets 
a financial institution s total capital is required to equal at least of risk weighted assets 
at least half of that must consist of tier core capital  and the remainder may be tier supplementary capital 
the risk based capital guidelines indicate the specific risk weightings by type of asset 
certain off balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit and binding loan commitments are multiplied by credit conversion factors to translate them into balance sheet equivalents before assigning them specific risk weightings 
due to the company s high level of core capital and substantial portion of earning assets invested in government securities  the tier capital ratio of and total capital ratio of substantially exceed the regulatory minimums

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customers and suppliers  allowance for loan losses  bad debts  investments  financing operations  long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which have formed the basis for making such judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the recorded estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the company s critical accounting policies are those relating to allowance for loan losses  goodwill and other intangibles  impairment of long lived assets  revenue recognition  and  accounting for stock based compensation 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s judgment of the losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the adequacy is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical trends  a review of individual loans  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics 
the allowance for loan losses are maintained on a bank by bank basis  however  the company uses a centralized credit administration function  which provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  and internal ranking systems 
goodwill and other intangibles are now to be accounted for under the sfas no 
 which was effective january  goodwill is no longer amortized  in accordance with sfas no 
 but is tested periodically for impairment 
the company has performed three impairment tests of goodwill since inception of the new standard 
as a result of those tests  the company has not recorded an impairment charge 
the company is amortizing other intangibles over their estimated useful life of years 
long lived assets including goodwill  other intangible assets and premises and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangibles were addressed above 
the impairment review for long lived assets other than goodwill includes a comparison of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets to their current carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset or group of assets exceeds expected cash flows undiscounted and with interest charges an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
revenue recognition is the recording of interest on loans and securities and is recognized based on rate multiplied by the principal amount outstanding 
interest accrual is discontinued when  in the opinion of management  the likelihood of collection becomes doubtful 
annual bankcard fees are recognized on a straight line basis over the period that cardholders may use the card 
other noninterest income is recognized as services are performed or revenue generating transactions are executed 
stock based compensation is recognized using the intrinsic value method for disclosure purposes 
per the requirements of fas proforma net income and earnings per share is disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements and discloses the impact on earnings as if the fair value method had been applied 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange prices  commodity prices or equity prices 
financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading 
the company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates of its assets held for purposes other than trading 
the following discussion of interest risk  however  combines instruments held for trading and instruments held for purposes other than trading because the instruments held for trading represent such a small portion of the company s portfolio that the interest rate risk associated with them is immaterial 
interest rate risk in the banking industry  a major risk exposure is changing interest rates 
to minimize the effect of interest rate changes to net interest income and exposure levels to economic losses  the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management within guidelines established by its funds management committee fmc and approved by the company s board of directors 
the fmc has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies  including interest rate exposure 
the company uses the following methods simulation tools for measuring and analyzing consolidated interest rate risk market value of equity modeling net portfolio value  net interest income simulation analysis  and  repricing mismatch analysis 
the company does not use hedges or swaps to manage interest rate risk except for the use of future contracts to offset interest rate risk on specific securities held in its trading portfolio 
market value of equity net portfolio value modeling the company uses the market value of equity modeling net portfolio value to measure and manage interest rate sensitivity 
the net portfolio value measures the degree to which the market values of the company s assets and liabilities will change given a change in interest rates 
this model is designed to represent  as of the respective date selected  the increase or decrease in the market value of assets and liabilities that would result from a hypothetical change in interest rates on such date 
the company uses a hypothetical rate change rate shock of basis points and basis points  up or down 
to perform these calculations  the company uses the current loan  investment and deposit portfolios 
the company then makes assumptions regarding new loans and deposits based on historical analysis  management s outlook and repricing strategies 
the company also analyzes loan prepayments and other market risks from industry estimates of prepayment yields and other market changes 
given the low level of current interest rates  the down basis point scenario cannot be completed as of december  table sets forth  for december  and  the increase or decrease as applicable in net portfolio value  that would be caused by the following hypothetical immediate changes in interest rates on such date an immediate increase of basis points  an immediate increase of basis points  and  an immediate decrease of basis points 
table includes both instruments entered into for trading purposes  and the instruments entered into for other than trading purposes  since the former represents such a small portion of the company s portfolio that any difference in the interest rate risk associated with it as compared with the risk associated with instruments entered into for other than trading purposes is immaterial 
the net portfolio value as of december  is higher than december  at both the and basis points increases 
the company should benefit from rate increases because a majority of its earnings assets and deposits have been repriced 
also  the company had higher loans at december  than december  table market risk in thousands net portfolio value rates in basis points rate shock december  december  amount change change amount change change static net interest income modeling another tool used to measure interest rate risk and the effect of interest rate changes on net interest income and net interest margin is net interest income simulation analysis 
this analysis incorporates substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities together with forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
through these simulations management estimates the impact on net interest income of a basis point upward or downward gradual change of market interest rates over a one year period 
these simulations include assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to change with changes in loan and deposit growth 
assumptions are made to project rates for new loans and deposits based on historical analysis  management outlook and repricing strategies 
loan prepayment and other market risks are developed from industry estimates of prepayment spreads and other market change 
since the results of these simulations can be significantly influenced by assumptions utilized  management evaluates the sensitivity of the simulation results to changes in assumptions 
due to the low level of current interest rates  the scenarios that simulate a basis point and a basis point decrease cannot be completed as of december  and table shows the net interest income increase or decrease over the next twelve months as of december  and both years show that if rates rise or basis points  net interest income will increase 
this is a result of being asset sensitive  meaning assets reprice more quickly than liabilities  giving rise to an improved net interest income in an increasing rate environment  and lower net interest income in a decreasing rate environment 
table market risk in thousands net interest income rates in basis points rate shock december  amount of change december  amount of change static repricing mismatch analysis the company also evaluates its interest rate sensitivity position in an attempt to maintain a balance between the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities which are expected to mature or reprice at any point in time 
while a traditional repricing mismatch analysis gap analysis provides a snapshot of interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics may not in fact reprice at the same time or the same degree 
also  it does not necessarily predict the impact of changes in general levels of interest rates on net interest income 
management attempts to structure the balance sheet to provide for the repricing of approximately equal amounts of assets and liabilities within specific time intervals 
table is a static gap analysis  which presents the company s assets and liabilities  based on their repricing or maturity characteristics 
this analysis shows that the company is in a positive gap position because assets maturing or repricing exceed liabilities

credit risk management credit risk represents the risk that a customer or counterparty may not perform in accordance with contractual terms 
credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers 
the company utilizes a centralized credit administration function  which provides information on affiliate bank risk levels  delinquencies  an internal ranking system and overall credit exposure 
in addition  loan requests are centrally reviewed to insure the consistent application of the loan policy and standards 
in addition  the company has an internal loan review staff that operates independently of the affiliate banks 
this review team performs periodic examinations of each bank s loans for credit quality  documentation and loan administration 
the respective regulatory authority of each affiliate bank also reviews loan portfolios 
another means of ensuring loan quality is diversification 
by keeping its loan portfolio diversified  the company has avoided problems associated with undue concentrations of loans within particular industries 
commercial real estate loans comprise only of total loans  with no history of significant losses 
the company has no significant exposure to highly leveraged transactions and has no foreign credits in its loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses  all has been discussed prior in this analysis 
also  please see table for a five year analysis of the all 
the adequacy of the all is reviewed quarterly  considering such items as historical loss trends  a review of individual loans  current economic conditions  loan growth and characteristics  industry or segment concentration and other factors 
a primary indicator of credit quality and risk management is the level of nonperforming loans 
nonperforming loans include both nonaccrual loans and restructured loans 
the company s nonperforming loans increased million at december   compared to an increase of million a year earlier 
the major portion of nonperforming loans is due to three commercial loan customers 
the company s nonperforming loans have not exceeded of total loans in any of the last five years 
the company has thousand in other real estate owned as of december   compared to million in the million in was primarily associated with one foreclosed credit 
loans past due more than days totaled million at december  compared to million at december  a loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when payments are past due days or more and or when management has considerable doubt about the borrower s ability to repay on the terms originally contracted 
the accrual of interest is discontinued and recorded thereafter only when actually received in cash 
certain loans are restructured to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal due to deterioration in the financial condition of the respective borrowers 
in  there was no reduction or deferral of interest due 
the balance of restructured loans was less than million at december  table loan quality in thousands december nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets loans past due days or more reserve for loans losses ratios nonperforming loans as a of loans nonperforming assets as a of loans plus other real estate owned nonperforming assets as a of total assets loans past due days or more as a of loans reserve for loan losses a of loans reserve for loan losses a multiple of nonperforming loans x x x x x liquidity risk liquidity represents the company s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional funds 
the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of a large  stable supply of core deposits and wholesale funds 
ultimately  public confidence is generated through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
the primary source of liquidity for the company is regularly scheduled payments on and maturity of assets  which include billion of high quality securities available for sale 
the liquidity of the company and its affiliate banks is also enhanced by its activity in the federal funds market and by its core deposits 
neither the company nor its subsidiaries are active in the debt market 
the traditional funding source for the company s subsidiary banks has been core deposits 
the company has not issued any debt since when million of medium term notes were issued to fund bank acquisitions 
prior to being paid off in february  these notes were rated a by moody s investor service and a by standard and poor s 
based upon regular contact with investment banking firms  management is confident in its ability to raise debt or equity capital on favorable terms  should the need arise 
the company also has other commercial commitments that may impact liquidity 
these commitments include unused commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees  and commercial letters of credit 
the total amount of these commercial commitments at december  was billion 
since many of these commitments expire without being drawn upon  the total amount of these commercial commitments does not necessarily represent the future cash requirements of the company 
the company s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders  debt service and treasury stock purchases 
management fees and dividends received from subsidiary banks traditionally have been sufficient to satisfy these requirements and are expected to be sufficient in the future 
the company s subsidiary banks are subject to various rules regarding payment of dividends to the company 
for the most part  all banks can pay dividends at least equal to their current year s earnings without seeking prior regulatory approval 
from time to time  approvals have been requested to allow a subsidiary bank to pay a dividend in excess of its current earnings 
all such requests have been approved 
operational risk the company is exposed to numerous types of operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency  or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
included in the legal and regulatory issues with which the company must comply are a number of recently imposed rules resulting from the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of the company operates in many markets and places reliance on the ability of its employees and systems to properly process a high number of transactions 
in the event of a breakdown in the internal control systems  improper operation of systems or improper employee actions  the company could suffer financial loss  face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation 
in order to address this risk  management maintains a system of internal controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
the company maintains systems of controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the company s operations 
these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the company s financial strength  the environment in which it operates  and considering factors such as competition and regulation 
the company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics and business practices are followed on a uniform basis 
in certain cases  the company has experienced losses from operational risk 
such losses have included the effects of operational errors that the company has discovered and included as expense in the statement of income 
while there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer such losses in the future  management continually monitors and works to improve its internal controls  systems and corporate wide processes and procedures
