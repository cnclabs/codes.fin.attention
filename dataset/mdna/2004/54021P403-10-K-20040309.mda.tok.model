item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the discussion below in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
also  the discussion which follows contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below under factors which may affect future results 
executive summary we are one of the largest independent owners and operators of full service hotels in the united states in terms of our number of guest rooms and gross annual revenues  as reported by hotel motel management magazine in september we are considered an independent owner and operator because we do not operate our hotels under our own name 
we operate substantially all of our hotels under nationally recognized brands  such as crowne plaza  holiday inn and marriott 
as of march   we operated hotels with an aggregate of  rooms  located in states and canada 
of the hotels  hotels  with an aggregate of  rooms  are part of our continuing operations  while hotels  with an aggregate of  rooms  are being held for sale and classified as discontinued operations 
our portfolio of hotels consists of hotels that we wholly own and operate through subsidiaries  four hotels that we operate in joint ventures in which we have a or greater voting equity interest and exercise control  and one hotel that we operate in a joint venture in which we have a non controlling equity interest 
we consolidate all of these entities in our financial statements  other than the one entity in which we hold a non controlling equity interest and for which we account under the equity method 
on december   due to a number of factors  including our heavy debt load  a lack of available funds to maintain the quality of our hotels  a weakening us economy  and the severe decline in travel in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on september   we filed for voluntary reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
at the time of the chapter filing  our portfolio consisted of hotels 
following the consummation of our two plans of reorganization  we emerged from chapter with hotels  eight of the hotels having been conveyed to a lender in satisfaction of outstanding debt obligations and one having been returned to the lessor of a capital lease 
of the portfolio of hotels  hotels emerged from chapter on november   hotels emerged from chapter on may  and one hotel never filed under chapter in  we developed a strategy of owning and operating a portfolio of profitable  well maintained and appealing hotels at superior locations in strong markets 
we are implementing this strategy by renovating and repositioning certain of our existing hotels to improve performance  divesting hotels that do not fit this strategy or that are unlikely to do so without significant effort or expense  and acquiring selected hotels that better fit this strategy 
in accordance with this strategy and our efforts to reduce debt and interest costs  in we identified hotels  our only office building property and three land parcels for sale 
during and the first two months of  we sold five hotels and the office building for an aggregate sales price of million 
of the million aggregate net proceeds from the sales of these assets  we used million to pay down debt and million for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
as a result of these sales  as of 
table of contents march   our portfolio consisted of hotels and three land parcels  of which hotels and the three land parcels are held for sale 
operating summary below is a summary of our results of operations  which are presented in more detail in results of operations continuing operations revenues declined in and the combined period as a result of a lack of available funds to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels  the weak us economy and the severe decline in the lodging industry in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september  though the lodging industry experienced some recovery during the second half of  we were not able to benefit fully from the recovery due to deferred capital expenditures and renovation displacement at some of our hotels 
operating expenses declined in and the combined period primarily as a result of lower revenues 
as revenues declined  variable expenses also fell 
operating expenses also declined  in part  as a result of our cost reduction efforts in the wake of the weak economy and lower revenues 
interest expense declined in and the combined period because we were able to reorganize our debt as part of the chapter proceedings 
the reorganization resulted in lower principal amounts on some of our debt due to debt forgiveness  and lower interest rates on other of our debt 
also  during the bankruptcy proceedings  we did not pay interest on certain debt  as approved by the bankruptcy court 
depreciation and amortization expense declined in and the combined period due to the restatement of our assets to fair value as part of fresh start reporting 
since we are depreciating a lower asset base  our depreciation in was significantly less than in the combined period 
during  after identifying assets held for sale  we recorded impairment charges where the carrying values exceeded the estimated selling prices  net of selling costs 
we also analyzed our assets held for use at december  and recorded impairment charges  as appropriate  when the carrying values exceeded their undiscounted future cash flows 
during the combined period  we recorded a significant write down of our hotels as part of our fresh start reporting 
we also recorded significant impairment losses in summary of discontinued operations as previously discussed  pursuant to the terms of the plan of reorganization approved by the bankruptcy court on november   we conveyed eight wholly owned hotels to the lender in satisfaction of outstanding debt obligations and one wholly owned hotel was returned to the lessor of a capital lease in january the results of operations of these nine hotels are reported in discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
due primarily to the application of fresh start reporting in november  in which these and other assets were adjusted to their respective fair values  there were no gains or losses on these transactions 
in addition  pursuant to the strategy outlined above  at december   of our hotels and three land parcels were held for sale and reported in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations also include one hotel and one office building sold in accordingly  as of december   there were hotels and one office building reported in discontinued operations 
the assets held for sale at december  and the liabilities related to these assets are separately disclosed as current assets and current liabilities  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheet 
where the carrying values of the assets held for sale exceeded their estimated fair values  net of selling costs  we reduced the carrying values and recorded impairment charges 
fair values were determined using market prices and where the estimated selling prices  net of selling costs  exceeded the carrying values  no adjustments were recorded 
we classify an asset as held for sale if we expect to dispose of it within one year 
table of contents and it satisfies the other criteria specified by sfas no 
while we believe the completion of these dispositions is probable  the sale of these assets is subject to market conditions and we cannot provide assurance that we will finalize the sale of all or any of these assets on favorable terms or at all 
summarized below is certain financial data related to the five hotels and one office building sold between november  and march  in thousands aggregate sales price debt pay down total revenues for the year ended december  total direct operating expenses for the year ended december  the results of operations of the other hotels  of which we consolidate in our financial statements and one for which we account under the equity method  are reported in continuing operations 
our continuing operations reflect the results of operations of those hotels which we plan to retain in our portfolio for the foreseeable future and exclude results of operations of those hotels held for sale 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
as we prepare our financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies and estimates is included in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies and estimates consolidation policy all of our hotels are owned by operating subsidiaries 
we consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of those hotels where we own at least of the voting equity interest and we exercise control 
all of the subsidiaries are wholly owned except for five joint ventures  one of which is not consolidated but is accounted for under the equity method 
when we consolidate hotels in which we own less than of the voting equity interest  we include the assets and liabilities of those hotels in our consolidated balance sheet 
the third party interests in the net assets of those hotels are reported as minority interest on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  our consolidated statement of operations reflects the full revenues and expenses of those hotels and the third party portion of the net income or loss is reported as minority interest in our consolidated statements of operations 
if the loss applicable to the minority interest exceeds the minority s equity  we report the entire loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
when we account for an entity under the equity method  we record only our share of the investment on our consolidated balance sheet and our share of the net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
we own a non controlling equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture and have included our share of this investment in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
our share of the net income or loss of the unconsolidated joint venture is shown in interest income and other in our consolidated statements of operations 
our investment in this entity at december  was million and our share of the loss was  deferral policy we defer franchise application fees on the acquisition or renewal of a franchise as well as loan origination costs related to new or renewed loan financing arrangements 
deferrals relating to the acquisition or renewal of a franchise are amortized on a straight line basis over the period of the franchise agreement 
we amortize deferred financing costs over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
the effective interest method incorporates the present values of future cash outflows and the effective yield on the debt in determining the amortization of loan fees 
at december   these deferrals totaled million  of which million related to our continuing operations 
if we were to write these expenses off in the year of payment  our operating expenses in those years would be significantly higher 

table of contents asset impairment we invest significantly in real estate assets 
property  plant and equipment represent approximately of the total assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
our policy on asset impairment is  therefore  considered critical 
under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
we periodically evaluate our real estate assets to determine if there has been any impairment in the carrying value 
we record impairment charges if there are indicators of impairment and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying values 
as part of this evaluation  and in accordance with sfas no 
 we classify our properties into two categories  assets held for sale and assets held for use 
the fair values of the assets held for sale are based on the estimated selling prices less estimated costs to sell 
we determine the estimated selling prices in conjunction with our real estate brokers 
the estimated selling costs are based on our experience with similar asset sales 
we record impairment charges and write down respective hotel assets if their carrying values exceed the estimated selling prices less costs to sell 
as a result of this evaluation  during  we recorded impairment losses of million on assets held for sale 
with respect to assets held for use  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by these assets 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows for each hotel with their respective carrying values to determine if there are indicators of impairment 
if there are indicators of impairment  we determine the estimated fair values of these assets in conjunction with our real estate brokers 
as a result of this evaluation  we recorded impairment losses during of million on assets held for use 
in connection with our emergence from chapter  and the application of fresh start reporting in which we were required to restate our assets to fair values  we recorded a net write down of million on our real estate assets during in  we recorded impairment losses of million 
reorganization items in accordance with gaap  income and expenses related to our chapter proceedings were classified as reorganization items while the respective hotels were in chapter we continue to incur expenses as a result of the chapter proceedings but now classify these as general  administrative and other expenses 
the classification between reorganization items and operating expenses while we were in chapter involved judgment on the part of management 
in addition  as a result of the separation required between continuing operations and discontinued operations  we allocated the reorganization items incurred during the chapter proceedings between continuing operations and discontinued operations based on the values assigned to the respective properties subsequent to their emergence from chapter accrual of self insured obligations we are self insured up to certain amounts with respect to employee medical  employee dental  property insurance  general liability insurance  personal injury claims  workers compensation  automobile liability and other coverages 
we establish reserves for our estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
our reserves  which are reflected in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  are based on actuarial valuations and our history of claims 
our actuaries incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
trends in actual experience are an important factor in the determination of these estimates 
we believe that our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  however  actual experience in claim frequency and amount could materially differ from our estimates and adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and financial condition 
as of december   we had an accrued balance of approximately million for these expenses 
income statement overview on november   in connection with our emergence from chapter and in accordance with gaap  we applied fresh start reporting 
under fresh start reporting  assets and liabilities are restated to reflect their fair values 
as a result  for accounting purposes  our financial statements for periods subsequent to november  are considered to be those of a new reporting entity and are not considered to be comparable with the financial statements for periods on or prior to november  for this reason  we use the term successor when we refer to periods subsequent to november   and the term predecessor when we refer to periods on or prior to november  although we are required to make this distinction 
table of contents under gaap  for purposes of the discussion of results below  we have combined the predecessor s results for the period january  to november  with the successor s results for the period november  to december  and refer to it as the combined period 
the differences between periods due to fresh start reporting are explained where necessary 
the discussion below focuses primarily on our continuing operations 
in the continuing operations discussions  we compare the results of operations for the last three years for the consolidated hotels that we plan to retain in our portfolio for the foreseeable future 
revenues we categorize our revenues into the following three categories room revenues derived from guest room rentals  food and beverage revenues derived from hotel restaurants  room service  hotel catering and meeting room rentals  and other revenues derived from guests long distance telephone usage  laundry services  parking services  in room movie services  vending machine commissions  leasing of hotel space and other miscellaneous revenues 
transient revenues  which generally account for approximately of our room revenues  are revenues derived from individual guests who stay only for brief periods of time without a long term contract 
demand from groups makes up approximately of our room revenues while our contract revenues such as contracts with airlines for crew rooms account for the remaining we believe revenues in the hotel industry are best explained by the following three key performance indicators occupancy computed by dividing total room nights sold by the total available room nights  average daily rate adr computed by dividing total room revenues by total room nights sold  and revenue per available room revpar computed by dividing total room revenues by total available room nights 
revpar can also be obtained by multiplying the occupancy by the adr 
to obtain available room nights for a year  we multiply the number of rooms in our portfolio by the number of days in the year 
to obtain available room nights for a hotel sold during the year  we multiply the number of rooms in the hotel by the number of days between january and the date the hotel was sold 
these measures are influenced by a variety of factors  including national  regional and local economic conditions  the degree of competition with other hotels in the area and changes in travel patterns 
the demand for accommodations is also affected by normally recurring seasonal patterns and most of our hotels experience lower occupancy levels in the fall and winter months november through february which generally results in lower revenues  lower net income and less cash flow during these months 
operating expenses operating expenses fall into the following categories direct expenses these expenses tend to vary with available rooms and occupancy 
however  hotel level expenses contain significant elements of fixed costs and  therefore  do not decline proportionately with revenues 
direct expenses are further categorized as follows rooms expenses expenses incurred in generating room revenues  food and beverage expenses expenses incurred in generating food and beverage revenues  and 
table of contents other direct expenses expenses incurred in generating the revenue activities classified in other revenues 
general  administrative and other expenses  which include salaries for hotel management  advertising and promotion  franchise fees  repairs and maintenance  utilities  equipment  ground and building rentals  insurance  property and other taxes  legal and professional fees  and corporate overhead  including corporate salaries and benefits  accounting services  directors fees  costs for office space and information technology costs 
also included in general  administrative and other expenses for the year ended december  are expenses relating to post emergence chapter activities 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation of fixed assets primarily hotel assets and amortization of deferred franchise fees 
impairment charges charges which were required to write down hotel carrying values to their fair values 
non operating items non operating items include interest expense  preferred stock dividends and amortization of deferred loan fees  gain on disposal of assets  interest income  our share of the income or loss of our non controlling equity interest in one hotel  for which we account under the equity method  and minority interests our equity partners share of the income or loss of the four hotels owned by joint ventures that we consolidate 

table of contents results of operations continuing operations year ended december  compared to the combined period revenues continuing operations combined period increase decrease revenues in thousands rooms food and beverage other total revenues occupancy adr revpar the decline in room revenues results from the decline in occupancy and adr 
occupancy declined by while adr declined by 
the decline in occupancy reflected the general decline in the lodging industry but also reflected  in part  some loss in volume due to renovations being performed at some of our hotels  brand changes and reduced performance at some hotels due to their need for renovation 
the decline in adr was due to lower demand for hotels as well as a change in buying patterns with more guests purchasing discounted rooms via the internet 
food and beverage and other revenues were also affected by the decline in occupancy and a reduction in group banquet and catering functions 
other revenues  which declined by  were affected by a decline in telephone revenues as a result of the increased usage of cell phones by our guests as well as the availability of free high speed internet access at some of our hotels 
some positive signs have started to emerge for the lodging industry 
smith travel research recently forecasted revpar growth in due to rising occupancy and room rates and improving supply and demand fundamentals 
we expect to realize some of the benefits of that growth but believe that we will not benefit fully from the recovery  particularly as some of our hotels are still under renovation and some need to be renovated 
some of our hotels recently have been renovated and we expect that these and others will benefit from the recovery 
to assist us in isolating the temporary effects on hotels which have undergone major change or are undergoing change  we have identified a group of hotels as stabilized hotels 
stabilized hotels are those hotels included in our portfolio on december  which were not held for sale  were not undergoing major renovation during or we consider a major renovation to be a renovation which in the aggregate exceeded  per room  or were not subject to brand changes during or the table below presents data on our stabilized hotels combined increase period decrease number of stabilized hotels number of rooms occupancy adr revpar 
table of contents the decline in occupancy for our stabilized hotels was lower than the decline in occupancy for our hotels included in continuing operations  as stabilized hotels were not affected by displacements from hotel renovations 
however  adr of stabilized hotels declined more than adr for all hotels in continuing operations because stabilized hotels included a higher proportion of hotels in need of renovation  resulting in the decline in revpar for our stabilized hotels being the same as for all hotels included in our continuing operations 
direct operating expenses continuing operations combined period increase decrease in thousands direct operating expenses rooms food and beverage other total direct operating expenses of total revenues direct operating expenses  which vary with revenues  were lower due to lower revenues 
however  these expenses were not reduced proportionately with revenues due to fixed costs and the need to maintain minimum levels of service regardless of occupancy declines 
fixed costs primarily relate to salaried employees and benefits 
rooms expenses on an actual cost per occupied room basis increased as a result of increases in benefit costs of the total increase  enhanced complimentary food and beverage items to guests enrolled in our brand loyalty programs of the total increase and general cost increases for expendable items used in the rooms department 
benefit costs include group health insurance  our k plan and workers compensation 
due to declining room demand in the first half of and a shift in room demand to internet booking sites that provide discounted room rates  we were unable to achieve gains in adr to offset these cost increases 
the food and beverage department benefited from our improved purchasing program and greater controls on inventory  partially offset by increased benefit costs 
other expenses decreased by million due in part to a million decline in telephone expenses as a result of increased usage of cell phones by our guests 
we continued to realize cost efficiencies through the negotiation of national purchase contracts for all of our hotels 
through such contracts  we have benefited from lower unit costs on some of our routinely purchased items 
other operating expenses continuing operations combined period increase decrease in thousands other operating expenses general  administrative and other depreciation and amortization impairment of long lived assets   n m total other operating expenses of total revenues 
table of contents general  administrative and other expenses were million higher in as a result of increases in the following we incurred million in legal  professional and other costs related to the chapter proceedings 
prior to our emergence from chapter  these costs would have been classified as reorganization expenses 
insurance costs increased million due to increased insurance premium costs and safety training programs  utility costs increased million due to increases in rates and increases in consumption caused by severe weather conditions in the northeast  ground and property rent increased million due to escalation clauses in the lease agreements  and repairs and maintenance costs increased million due to enhanced preventative maintenance programs as well as to delayed renovations on some of our hotels 
these higher expenses were offset by reductions in other expenses  as follows legal and other professional fees decreased by approximately million partially as a result of our reduced reliance on external professional services and also as a result of the resolution of a number of litigation cases through the chapter proceedings  equipment rentals decreased by million as a result of the initiation of improved lease programs for hotel vans  copiers and other equipment  franchise fees decreased by million 
substantially all of our franchise fees are revenue based and  therefore  fell as a result of the reduction in revenues  and bad debt expense decreased by million 
this was partially due to a release of previous reserves during of million that was no longer needed and an improvement in our portfolio as compared to the combined period 
depreciation and amortization expense declined by million 
depreciation expense was reduced as a result of fresh start reporting 
as part of fresh start reporting  we were required to adjust our assets to fair values and  as a result  recorded a net write down of fixed assets of million 
after implementing fresh start reporting  our monthly depreciation decreased by million million annualized 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization of deferred franchise fees due to an increase in the fair values of deferred franchise fees 
amortization of deferred franchise fees increased by approximately  per month million annualized 
the impairment of long lived assets of million recorded during represents reductions made to the carrying values of certain hotels held for use  to bring them in line with their estimated fair values 
non operating income expenses continuing operations combined period increase decrease in thousands non operating income expenses interest income and other interest expense preferred stock dividend   n m other interest expense gain on asset dispositions n m reorganization items minority interests 
table of contents interest income and other for the combined period included million of gain on extinguishment of debt 
this gain related to discharge of a promissory note in the name of macon hotel associates  llc mha  a owned subsidiary 
the lender discharged the indebtedness of million plus related accrued interest approximating million in exchange for payment by mha of million 
the preferred stock dividend relates to dividends on the preferred stock issued on november  dividends for the period january  to december  totaled million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 effective for us on july   dividends relating to the period after the effective date are reported as interest expense 
dividends for the period prior to the effective date continue to be shown as a deduction from retained earnings with no effect on our results of operations 
as a result  the million dividend accrued for the period july  to december  is reported in interest expense while the million dividend accrued for the periods january  to june  are shown as deductions from retained earnings 
included in other interest expense for is amortization of loan fees of million 
for the combined period  amortization of loan fees were de minimus because we wrote off all deferred loan fees when we filed for chapter in december a significant portion of our debt is variable based primarily on one month libor 
our variable rate debt at december  approximated million 
interest expense on our variable rate debt fell as a result of reductions in libor and reductions in the interest rate spread 
libor averaged for and for the combined period 
also  the interest rate spread on the merrill lynch mortgage debt incurred in november is approximately basis points  or  lower than the interest rate spread on the variable rate debt that it replaced 
the interest expense associated with the lehman financing obtained in may served to offset the reduction in interest discussed above 
though the lehman financing replaced previous debt  we paid no interest during on the debt that it replaced  as approved by the bankruptcy court 
the gain on asset dispositions for relates to consideration received for condemned land less the carrying values 
reorganization items for of million represent chapter expenses incurred between january  and may  relating to the hotels that emerged from chapter on may  we continue to incur expenses related to the chapter proceedings but currently report these expenses as part of general  administrative and other expenses 
in accordance with gaap  all expenses related to the chapter proceedings between january  and november  were reported as reorganization items  including the fair value adjustments recorded on the implementation of fresh start reporting 
reorganization items for the combined period consisted of the following adjustments recorded on the application of fresh start reporting of million consisting of a gain on extinguishment of debt of million offset by fixed asset write downs and other fresh start adjustments of million  and expenses incurred as a result of the chapter proceedings of approximately million  consisting mainly of legal and professional fees 
minority interests represent the third party owners share of the net income or loss of the four joint ventures in which we have a controlling equity interest 
the increase of million relates primarily to one joint venture owning one hotel 
the net loss of this joint venture was higher in as a result of an impairment charge recorded to write down the carrying value of the hotel 

table of contents the combined period compared to the year ended december  revenues continuing operations combined period increase decrease revenues in thousands rooms food and beverage other total revenues occupancy adr revpar revenues for in the table above include the revenues of six hotels sold in  while occupancy  adr and revpar in the table exclude the six hotels sold in revenues in for these six hotels were in thousands rooms food and beverage other total revenues after excluding the million from the room revenues for six hotels sold in  thereby producing room revenues for a comparable portfolio  the decline in room revenues was 
this reduction in room revenues resulted from declines in both occupancy and adr 
occupancy declined by while adr declined by 
these reductions reflected the general decline in the economy and the lodging industry in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september  and hotel quality issues due to the liquidity constraints which led to our chapter filing 
occupancy  adr and revpar were also affected by renovation displacement at some of our hotels 
the lower food and beverage revenues were due to the lower occupancy levels in the combined period 
other revenues declined in the combined period primarily due to a million reduction in telephone revenues resulting from increased cell phone usage 
the table below presents data on our stabilized hotels combined increase period decrease number of stabilized hotels number of rooms occupancy adr revpar the decline in occupancy for our stabilized hotels was lower than the decline in occupancy for all hotels included in our continuing operations  as stabilized hotels were not affected by renovation displacements 
in addition  adr of stabilized hotels declined more than adr of all hotels in continuing operations because stabilized hotels included a higher proportion of hotels in need of renovation  resulting in the decline in revpar for our stabilized hotels being greater than the decline in revpar for all hotels included in our continuing operations

as a percentage of room revenues  our room expenses increased in the combined period but the actual cost per occupied room declined 
our margins were also affected by the decline in adr 
food and beverage margins were negatively affected by a decline in banquet catering and meetings business in the combined period 
the banquet catering and meetings business is the most profitable area of our food and beverage operations 
other operating expenses remained flat despite lower sales due to our inability to offset a large portion of fixed expenses in this department 
other operating expenses continuing operations combined period increase decrease in thousands other operating expenses general  administrative and other depreciation and amortization impairment of long lived assets total other operating expenses of total revenues general  administrative and other expenses decreased by million 
of the million decrease  million related to six hotels sold in in addition  the property level component of general  administrative and other expenses was lower in the combined period  primarily as a result of reductions in revenues 
general  administrative and other expenses for the combined period also declined as a result of reductions in corporate overhead due to cost reductions at the corporate office 
these initiatives included reductions in staffing  office space and technology 
depreciation and amortization expense for the combined period decreased by million 
of the million decrease  million was attributable to six hotels sold in the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense was also due to the reduced carrying values of certain assets arising from 
table of contents impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation related to capital improvements 
also  depreciation for the period november  to december  declined as a result of the write down of fixed assets recorded when we implemented fresh start reporting 
the million of impairment charges for consisted of the following a million charge related to revised estimates of fair value for properties held for sale  a million charge related to one property which was identified as held for sale and also sold in  and impairment charges on assets held for use of million  offset by a recapture of million of impairment charges related to assets previously held for sale that were no longer being actively marketed for sale 
non operating income expenses continuing operations combined period increase decrease in thousands non operating income expenses interest income and other interest expense gain on asset dispositions reorganization items minority interests preferred redeemable securities minority interests other interest income and other increased significantly in the combined period primarily as the result of a discharge of indebtedness in respect of mha  a owned subsidiary 
the resulting gain on extinguishment of this indebtedness was million and resulted from the exchange of a promissory note of million plus related accrued interest approximating million in exchange for payment by mha of million 
interest expense for the combined period decreased as a result of the suspension of interest payments on debt secured by highly leveraged hotels while we were in chapter where the estimated value of the underlying collateral in respect of certain debts was considered to be less than the carrying value of that debt  we ceased accruing interest on those debts 
contractual interest expense in respect of those debts that was not recorded for the combined period excluding interest on our crests approximated million 
recorded interest expense for the combined period also declined as a result of decreasing interest rates on our variable rate debt 
libor for the combined period averaged while the average for was 
the gain on asset disposition for related primarily to the sale of one hotel in the first quarter of and represents the excess of the net proceeds of the sale over the net book value of assets sold 
reorganization items for the combined period consisted of the following adjustments recorded on the application of fresh start reporting of million  consisting of gain on extinguishment of debt of million offset by fixed asset write downs and other fresh start adjustments of million  and expenses incurred as a result of the chapter proceedings of approximately million consisting mainly of legal and professional fees 
reorganization items for consisted of write offs of deferred loan fees of million and expenses incurred as a result of the chapter proceedings of approximately million 

table of contents minority interest differed significantly in the combined period compared to as a result of the non accrual of interest on the crests 
we ceased accruing interest on the crests while we were in chapter as these were unsecured debts 
crests interest not accrued for the combined period approximated million 
results of operations discontinued operations discontinued operations include results of operations for both assets sold during the reporting period and assets that have been identified for sale 
consequently  the hotels and three land parcels that were held for sale at december   as well as the ten hotels and the office building that were sold or otherwise disposed of during  are included in discontinued operations 
we present the current year s results of these hotels as discontinued operations as well as the comparative results for the previous two years

table of contents the disposition of nine hotels in january adversely affects comparability between periods of results of operations for the properties included in discontinued operations 
results of operations for our discontinued operations were affected by the same macroeconomic factors discussed above for our continuing operations 
additional factors affecting the results for  the combined period and are discussed below 
year ended december  compared to the combined period revenues and expenses included in discontinued operations were affected by hotel dispositions in january the combined period results include the following revenues and expenses for eight hotels conveyed to a lender in satisfaction of related debt and one hotel returned to the lessor of a capital lease in january combined period in thousands revenues rooms food and beverage other total revenues operating expenses direct rooms food and beverage other total direct expenses general  administrative and other depreciation and amortization substantially all of the total revenue  direct expense  and general  administrative and other expense differences between and the combined period are a result of the disposition of these nine hotels 
of the million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense between and the combined period  million was attributable to the disposition of these nine hotels 
additionally  the lower asset base as a result of fresh start reporting and the effect of not depreciating assets once they are identified for sale accounted for an additional million and million of the decrease  respectively 
the impairment of long lived assets of million recorded in represents the write down of assets held for sale 
in accordance with gaap  assets identified for sale are valued at the lower of their estimated selling prices  less costs to sell  and their carrying values 
where the estimated net selling prices exceeded the carrying values  no gain was recorded 
gain on asset dispositions of million represents gain on the sale of one hotel and one office building in november the gain represents the excess of the net proceeds of the sale over the carrying values of these two properties 
the income tax benefit for the combined period related to a hotel sold during and represented reductions of accruals for state income tax provisions recorded during the combined period compared to the year ended december  the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense between the combined period and was due to the reduced carrying values of certain assets arising from impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of this decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation related to capital

reorganization items for the combined period consisted of adjustments recorded on the application of fresh start reporting of million consisting of gain on extinguishment of debt of million offset by fixed asset write downs and other fresh start adjustments of million  and expenses incurred as a result of the chapter proceedings of approximately million  consisting mainly of legal and professional fees 
reorganization items for consisted of write offs of deferred loan fees of million and expenses incurred as a result of the chapter proceedings of approximately million 
income taxes because we incurred net losses  we paid no federal income tax for the year ended december   the combined period or the year ended december  at december   we had available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes  which will expire in through under our plans of reorganization  substantial amounts of net operating loss carryforwards were utilized to offset income from debt cancellations in the combined period 
also  our reorganization under chapter resulted in an ownership change  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
consequently  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income is subject to certain annual limitations 
due to these limitations  a portion or all of these net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused 
at december   we established a valuation allowance of million to fully offset our net deferred tax asset 
in addition  we recognized an income tax provision of million for  a benefit of million for the combined period and a provision of million for the benefit for the combined period related primarily to a reduction of the provision recorded in  while the and provisions related primarily to liabilities for state income taxes 
ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a widely used industry measure of performance and also is used in the assessment of hotel property values 
ebitda is a non gaap measure and should not be used as a substitute for measures such as net income loss  cash flows from operating activities  or other measures computed in accordance with gaap 
depreciation and amortization are significant non cash expenses for us as a result of the high proportion of our assets which are long lived  including property  plant and equipment 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives and amortize deferred financing and franchise fees over the term of the applicable agreements 
we believe that ebitda provides pertinent information to investors as an additional indicator of our performance

quarterly results of operations the following table presents certain quarterly data for the eight quarters ended december  the data have been derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated 
our unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and include all adjustments  consisting primarily of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider to be necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods 
total revenues and total expenses for each quarter were as reported in our quarterly filings with the securities and exchange commission 
however  the allocation of the revenues and expenses between our continuing operations and discontinued operations are not as reported in our quarterly filings because the results of discontinued operations  in the tables below  are based on the hotels held for sale as of december  the allocation of results of operations between our continuing operations and 
table of contents discontinued operations  at the time of the quarterly filings  was based on the assets held for sale  if any  as of the dates of those filings

historically  our operations and related revenues and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter 
we expect these variations to continue for a variety of reasons  primarily seasonality 
however  due to the fixed nature of certain expenses  such as marketing and rent  our operating expenses do not vary as significantly from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources working capital we use our cash flows primarily for operating expenses  debt service  and capital expenditures 
currently  our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operations  existing cash balances and a million working capital revolving credit facility that expires on may  cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by factors such as a reduction in demand for lodging or certain large scale renovations being performed at our hotels 
to the extent that significant amounts of our accounts receivable are due from airline companies  a further downturn in the airline industry also could materially and adversely affect the collectibility of our accounts receivable  and hence our liquidity 
at december   airline receivables represented approximately of our accounts receivable  net of allowances 
a further downturn in the airline industry could also affect our revenues by decreasing the aggregate levels of demand for travel 
we expect that the sale of certain assets will provide additional cash to pay down outstanding debt and to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 
one of our hotels and an office building were sold during  four hotels were sold between january  and march  and we have hotels and three land parcels as held for sale 
of the five hotels and one office building sold between november  and march   the aggregate net proceeds received were million  million of which was used to pay down debt and million of which was used for general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures 
our ability to make scheduled debt service payments and fund operations and capital expenditures depends on our future performance and financial results  including the successful implementation of our business strategy and  to a certain extent  the general condition of the lodging industry and the general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory environment 
in addition  our ability to 
table of contents refinance our indebtedness depends to a certain extent on these factors as well 
many factors affecting our future performance and financial results  including the severity and duration of macroeconomic downturns  are beyond our control 
see matters which may affect future results risks related to our business 
during  we will seek to raise capital through an offering to the public of our common stock  the purpose of which will be to redeem our outstanding preferred stock to fund capital expenditures related to renovations and repositionings of selected hotels  and for general corporate purposes  including funding our growth strategy 
we intend to continue to use our cash flow to make scheduled debt service payments and fund our operations and capital expenditures and  therefore  do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
as provided by the terms of the preferred stock  we paid the dividends that were due on our preferred stock on november  by the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock  with fractional shares paid in cash 
although we have emerged from chapter  the distribution of shares to the general unsecured creditors is not complete as we continue to reconcile the claims made by those creditors 
we have established a disputed claims reserve out of which those claims will be paid 
until this process is complete  we will continue to incur expenses in respect of these claims as well as bankruptcy court fees and professional fees 
in accordance with gaap  all assets held for sale  including assets that would normally be classified as long term assets in the ordinary course of business  were reported as assets held for sale in current assets 
similarly  all liabilities related to assets held for sale were moved to the current liability category  including debt that would otherwise be classified as long term liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
at december   after reclassifying assets held for sale as current assets and liabilities related to the assets held for sale as current liabilities  we had working capital current assets less current liabilities of million  compared with a working capital deficit of million at december  see debt  contractual obligations and franchise agreements exit financing with respect to our decision to include the merrill lynch mortgage debt financing in our long term debt 
although there was some recovery in the hotel industry during the second half of  the weak us economy and the severe decline in the lodging industry after the terrorist attacks on september  continued to negatively affect lodging demand during it is difficult to predict how long it will take for the industry to recover fully and for our revenues from continuing operations to reach satisfactory levels 
we continue to focus on hotel renovations and repositionings  both as a means of improving our competitive position in individual markets and to comply with franchisor requirements 
during  we plan to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  subject to availability of funds 
in the short term  we continue to diligently monitor our costs 
we believe that the combination of our current cash  cash flows from operations  capital expenditure escrows  and the proceeds of asset sales will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next months 
if we fail to qualify for extensions of maturity on our debt obligations to merrill lynch mortgage and or lehman  we will seek to refinance those obligations with other lenders 
if we are unable to refinance those obligations with other lenders  we will pursue asset sales to reduce total indebtedness and loan to value ratios  and then seek to refinance the remaining debt 
it may not be possible to effect those asset sales in a timely fashion  further  large scale sales of hotels might adversely affect our business 
we cannot provide assurance that we will qualify for extensions of maturity on either the merrill lynch or lehman debt  or that  if we do not so qualify  we would be able to refinance those obligations with third parties on favorable terms  or at all 
our ability to meet our longer term cash needs is dependent on the recovery of the economy and the lodging industry  improved operating results  the successful implementation of our portfolio improvement strategy and our ability to obtain third party sources of capital on favorable terms as and when needed 
our future liquidity needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty and we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity to be able to meet our operating expenses  debt service requirements  including scheduled maturities  and planned capital expenditures 
we could lose the right to operate certain hotels under nationally recognized brand names  and furthermore  the termination of one or 
table of contents more franchise agreements could lead to defaults and acceleration under one or more of our loan agreements as well as obligations to pay liquidated damages under the franchise agreements 
see matters which may affect future results risks related to our business for further discussion of conditions that could adversely affect our estimates of future liquidity needs and sources of working capital 
cash flow operating activities continuing operations during  operating activities generated million in cash  while cash flows used in operating activities for the combined period was million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities is partially attributable to the availability in of cash which was previously restricted and also to the reduction in chapter expenses 
investing activities continuing operations investing activities accounted for an outlay of approximately million for compared with million for the combined period 
due primarily to large scale renovations performed at some of our hotels during  capital expenditures totaled million  million higher than the million spent in the combined period

we also received proceeds of million in as compensation for the condemnation of land 
net proceeds from the sale of a hotel and an office building totaled million 
though the net sale proceeds of million formed part of our cash provided from investing activities  on a consolidated basis  this is not reflected in the investing activities for our continuing operations on our consolidated statement of cash flows since it forms part of the cash flows of our discontinued operations 
other investing activities consisted primarily of other deposits and payments of franchise application fees net of refunds

in the table above  we report the merrill lynch mortgage debt as maturing in november because we intend to extend the maturity date and we believe we will be eligible for that extension 
see also factors which may affect future results risks relating to our business 

table of contents we did not include the following information in the table above interest obligations a substantial portion of our interest payments vary with libor and would be difficult to project 
for  interest paid with respect to our continuing operations was million  franchise fees substantially all of our franchise fees vary with our revenues 
franchise fees expense for relating to our continuing operations are shown below under the caption franchise agreements and capital expenditures  equipment rentals and costs relating to our maintenance contracts these items are of a short term nature and are cancellable by us 
for  costs relating to equipment rentals and maintenance contracts for our continuing operations were approximately million and million  respectively  and property and income taxes these taxes vary from year to year and are not estimable 
for  property taxes relating to our continuing operations were million 
we paid no federal income taxes for state income taxes paid  net of refunds  for were million 
other purchase obligations as of december   we had no material purchase obligations 
exit financing on november   we received exit financing of million comprised of three separate components as follows senior debt of million from merrill lynch mortgage  accruing interest at the rate of libor plus  secured by  among other things  first mortgage liens on the fee simple or leasehold interests in of our hotels  mezzanine debt of million from merrill lynch mortgage  accruing interest at the rate of libor plus  secured by the equity interest in the subsidiaries owning of our hotels the hotels which secure the senior debt and one additional hotel  and debt provided through computershare trust company of canada  a canadian lender  of million canadian dollars approximately million us dollars at inception maturing in december  accruing interest at the fixed rate of and secured by a mortgage on the property located in windsor  canada 
in march  as permitted by the terms of the senior and mezzanine debt agreements  merrill lynch mortgage exercised its right to resize the senior and mezzanine debt amounts  prior to the securitization of the mortgage loan 
as a result  the principal amount of the senior debt was decreased from million initially million less million of principal payments to million  and the principal amount of the mezzanine debt was increased from million initially million less million of principal payments to million 
though the blended interest rate on the merrill lynch mortgage debt remained at libor plus at the date of the resizing  the interest rate on the senior debt was modified to libor plus and the interest rate on the mezzanine debt was modified to libor plus 
the interest rate on the mezzanine debt increased to libor plus as of december  therefore  the new blended rate on the merrill lynch mortgage debt is libor plus 
furthermore  as a result of the securitization of the mortgage loan  merrill lynch mortgage no longer has the right to amend or waive provisions thereunder 
the senior and mezzanine debt matures in november  but we have three one year options which could extend the maturity date for an additional three years 
the first option to extend the maturity date of the senior and mezzanine debt by up to one year to november is available to us provided no events of default occur in respect of the payment of principal  interest and other required amounts 
because we intend to extend the maturity date and we believe we will be eligible for that extension  we report the senior and mezzanine debt as maturing in the second and third extension terms will be available to us only if no events of default of any kind exist  and are subject to a minimum debt service coverage ratio of x and a debt yield requirement of  which we currently do not satisfy 
payments of principal and interest under 
table of contents this facility are due monthly 
at maturity  we will either exercise the extension option with merrill lynch mortgage or seek to refinance these loans with a new lender 
the senior and mezzanine debt agreements provide that when either i the debt yield for the trailing month period is below during the year ending november and if the loan is extended   and during each of the next three years of the loan  respectively or ii the debt service coverage ratio is below x  excess cash flows produced by the mortgaged hotels after payment of operating expenses  management fees  required reserves  service fees  principal and interest must be deposited in a restricted cash account 
these funds can be used for the prepayment of aggregate outstanding borrowings  capital expenditures reasonably approved by the lender  and up to an aggregate million of scheduled principal and interest payments due under these agreements 
funds will no longer be deposited into the restricted cash account when the debt yield and the debt service coverage ratio are sustained above the minimum requirements for three consecutive months 
on march   the debt yield for the hotels securing this debt fell below the then applicable minimum threshold and  therefore  the excess cash flow produced by the hotels securing the debt was retained in the restricted cash account starting on may  the restricted cash balance in this account as of december  was million 
during  million was released from the restricted cash account for capital expenditures and scheduled interest and principal payments 
as of march   no cash was being retained in the restricted cash account 
at december   the debt yield and the debt service coverage ratio remained below the minimum requirements 
further  the mezzanine debt agreement with merrill lynch mortgage requires that we maintain a minimum net worth of at least million 
lehman financing on may   we completed the million lehman financing  which was primarily used to settle debts secured by hotels 
the lehman financing  provided to newly formed subsidiaries one for each hotel  is a two year term loan with an optional one year extension and bears interest at the higher of or libor plus 
the one year extension is only available if  at the time of electing to extend and at the initial maturity date  there are no events of default 
if we opt for the one year extension  an extension fee of million is payable 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  additional interest of million is also payable upon the maturity date may   or the new maturity date if we opt for the extension 
payments of principal and interest on the lehman financing are due monthly 
if an event of default occurs  the interest rate increases by basis points  or  for the period of the default 
at maturity in may  we will either exercise this extension option with lehman or seek to refinance these loans with a new lender 
other financings on november   loans approximating million  secured by hotels  were substantially reinstated on their original terms  except for the extension of certain maturities 
the terms of one other loan  in the amount of million and secured by one hotel  were amended to provide for a new interest rate and a new maturity date 
our indebtedness to jp morgan chase of approximately million represents industrial revenue bonds issued on the holiday inn lawrence and holiday inn manhattan  both kansas properties 
the industrial revenue bonds require a minimum debt service coverage ratio  calculated as of the end of each calendar year 
for the year ended december   the cash flows of both hotels were insufficient to meet the minimum debt service coverage ratio requirements 
the trustee of the industrial revenue bonds may give notice of default  at which time we could remedy the default by depositing with the trustee an amount currently estimated at approximately million 
in the event a default is declared and not cured  the properties would be subject to foreclosure and we would be obligated to reimburse bondholders  pursuant to a partial guaranty  of approximately million 
in addition  we could be obligated to pay our franchisor liquidated damages in the amount of million 
total revenues for these two hotels for the year ended december   the combined period and the year ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents on september   first mortgage debt of approximately million of mha became due 
we own of mha  and mha s sole asset is the crowne plaza hotel in macon  georgia 
the lender initially agreed to extend the term of the debt to december   and then to june   while we explore alternative financing opportunities 
we have escrowed foreclosure documents that will allow the lender to foreclose on the property on june  if we have not repaid the mortgage debt by that date 
there can be no assurance that we will complete a refinancing on or before the due date or that the lender will grant further extensions 
if we are not able to refinance the debt and the lender does not grant further extensions  the property would be subject to foreclosure 
a foreclosure on the property would constitute a default of the franchise agreement  therefore  we may be liable for million in liquidated damages under the franchise agreement 
total revenues for the crowne plaza hotel in macon  georgia for the year ended december   the combined period and the year ended december  were million  million and million  respectively

table of contents preferred stock on november   we issued  shares of preferred stock with a par value of at per share 
each share of preferred stock has a liquidation preference over our common stock 
the dividend is cumulative  compounded annually and is payable at the rate of per annum on november of each year 
as provided by the terms of the preferred stock  the first dividend was paid on november  by means of the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock  with fractional shares paid in cash 
we thus issued  shares of preferred stock as dividends and paid cash dividends of approximately  for fractional shares 
we expect to issue an additional  shares of preferred stock as dividends to those general unsecured creditors who have not yet received their shares of preferred stock 
if any preferred stock is then outstanding  the board of directors will determine whether the dividends due november  and will be paid in cash or in kind via the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock 
the preferred stock is subject to redemption at any time at our option and to mandatory redemption on november  if we redeem the preferred stock prior to november   the redemption price will be of the liquidation value per share of the preferred stock 
the liquidation value is per share plus accrued dividends 
the redemption price is reduced by for each succeeding twelve month period through november   after which the preferred stock is redeemable for the liquidation value 
on july   in accordance with sfas no 
 we reclassified the preferred stock to the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet and began presenting the related dividends in interest expense  which totaled million for the period july  to december  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we presented the preferred stock between liabilities and equity in our consolidated balance sheet called the mezzanine section and reported the preferred stock dividend as a deduction from retained earnings  with no effect on our results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the preferred stock and the dividends for the period prior to july   have not been reclassified 
franchise agreements and capital expenditures we benefit from the superior brand qualities of the crowne plaza  holiday inn  marriott  hilton and other brands  including the reputation of these brands  reservation bookings through their central reservation systems  global distribution systems  guest loyalty programs and brand internet booking sites 
reservations made by means of these franchisor facilities generally account for approximately of our total reservations 
to obtain these franchise affiliations  we enter into franchise agreements with hotel franchisors that generally have terms of between and years 
these franchise agreements typically authorize us to operate a hotel under the franchise name  at a specific location or within a specified area  and require that we operate the hotel in accordance with the standards specified by the franchisor 
as part of our franchise agreements  we are generally required to pay a royalty fee  an advertising marketing fee  a fee for the use of the franchisor s nationwide reservation system and certain ancillary charges 
royalty fees generally range from to of gross room revenues  advertising marketing fees generally range from to of gross room revenues and reservation system fees generally range from to of gross room revenues 
in the aggregate  royalty fees  advertising marketing fees and reservation fees for the various brands under which we operate our hotels range from to of gross room revenues 
the costs incurred in connection with these agreements are primarily monthly payments due to the franchisors based on a percentage of room revenues 
these costs vary with revenues and are not fixed commitments 
franchise fees incurred for the year ended december  and the comparative periods were combined period in thousands continuing operations discontinued operations 
table of contents during the term of the franchise agreements  the franchisors may require us to upgrade facilities to comply with their current standards 
our current franchise agreements terminate at various times and have differing remaining terms 
for example  the terms of seven  twelve and ten of our franchise agreements are scheduled to expire in  and  respectively 
as franchise agreements expire  we may apply for a franchise renewal 
in connection with renewals  the franchisor may require payment of a renewal fee  increased royalty and other recurring fees and substantial renovation of the facilities  or the franchisor may elect at its sole discretion not to renew the franchise 
if we do not comply with the terms of a franchise agreement  following notice and an opportunity to cure the noncompliance or default  the franchisor has the right to terminate the agreement  which could lead to a default and acceleration under one or more of our loan agreements  which could materially and adversely affect us 
in the past  we have been able to cure most cases of noncompliance and most defaults within the cure periods 
if we perform an economic analysis of the hotel and determine that it is not economically justifiable to comply with a franchisor s requirements  we will either select an alternative franchisor or operate the hotel without a franchise affiliation 
this could adversely affect us 
see factors which may affect future results risks related to our business 
as of march   we have been notified that we were not in compliance with some of the terms of ten of our franchise agreements and have received default and termination notices from franchisors with respect to an additional five hotels 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete our action plans which we estimate will cost approximately million to cure the alleged instances of noncompliance and default prior to the specified termination dates or be granted additional time in which to cure any defaults or other noncompliance 
we believe we are in compliance with our other franchise agreements 
in addition  as part of our bankruptcy reorganization proceedings  we entered into stipulations with each of our major franchisors setting forth a timeline for completion of capital expenditures for some of our hotels 
however  we have not completed the required capital expenditures for hotels in accordance with the stipulations and estimate that the cost of completing the required capital expenditures is million 
the franchisor could therefore seek to declare its franchise agreement in default and could seek to terminate the franchise agreement 
with the exception of one hotel held for sale  we believe that we will cure the noncompliance and defaults on these hotels before the applicable termination dates  but we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to obtain additional time in which to do so 
if a franchise agreement is terminated  we will either select an alternative franchisor or operate the hotel independently of any franchisor 
however  terminating or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel could require us to incur significant expenses  including liquidated damages  and capital expenditures 
to comply with the requirements of our franchisors and to improve our competitive position in the individual markets  we plan to enhance our capital expenditures in off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements

the franchisor could therefore seek to declare its franchise agreement in default and could seek to terminate the franchise agreement 
if a franchise agreement is terminated  we will either select an alternative franchisor or operate the hotel independently of any franchisor 
however  terminating or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel could require us to incur significant expenses  including liquidated damages and capital expenditures 
moreover  the loss of a franchise agreement could have a material adverse effect upon the operations or the underlying value of the hotel covered by the franchise because of the loss of associated guest loyalty  name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor 
we also would be in default under one or more of our loan agreements if we are unable to replace  in a timely fashion which  in the case of hotels that secure our lehman financing  is only five days  a terminated franchise agreement with a new franchise agreement acceptable to the lender whose loan is secured by the affected hotel and we fail to prepay a contractually specified release value relating to that hotel to the lender  or in the case of hotels that secure our borrowings from merrill lynch mortgage  we experience either four franchise agreement terminations at one time  or one or more franchise agreement terminations for hotels whose allocated loan amounts represents or more of the total allocated loan amounts 
any such franchise agreement terminations could materially and adversely affect us 
our current franchise agreements terminate at various times and have differing remaining terms 
for example  the terms of seven  twelve and ten of our franchise agreements are scheduled to expire in  and  respectively 
as a condition to renewal  the franchise agreements frequently contemplate a renewal application process  which may require substantial capital improvements to be made to the hotel and 
table of contents substantial increases in franchise fees payable to the franchisor 
significant unexpected capital expenditures and franchise fees would adversely affect us 
hotels require a high level of capital expenditures  maintenance and repairs and if we are not able to meet these requirements of our hotels appropriately  our business and operating results will suffer 
in order to maintain our hotels in good condition and attractive appearance  it is necessary to replace furnishings  fixtures and equipment periodically  generally every five to seven years  and to maintain and repair public areas and exteriors on an ongoing basis 
due to a lack of available funds  made worse by our heavy debt load  weakness in the us economy  and the severe decline in travel in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september   we have deferred many capital expenditures on our hotels 
if we do not make necessary maintenance  repairs and capital improvements  occupancy and room rates could fall  thereby adversely affecting our operating results  and we risk termination of franchise agreements at the affected hotels 
further  the process of renovating a hotel can be disruptive to operations  and a failure to properly plan and execute renovations and to schedule them during seasonal declines in business can result in renovation displacement  an industry term for a temporary loss of revenue due to implementing renovations 
all of our hotels are pledged as collateral for mortgage loans  and we have a significant amount of debt that could limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition 
as of december   we had million of total long term debt outstanding 
we are subject to the risks normally associated with significant amounts of debt  such as we may not be able to repay  refinance or extend our maturing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all 
we have million  million and million of indebtedness maturing in  and  respectively 
of these amounts  the merrill lynch mortgage financing  which matures in november and is subject to three one year extensions  totaled million as of december  and currently is secured by of our hotels 
the first option to extend the maturity date of the merrill lynch mortgage debt by up to one year to november will be available to us as long as no events of default occur in respect of the payment of principal  interest and other required amounts 
because we intend to extend the maturity date and we believe we will be eligible for that extension  we report that debt as maturing in the second and third extension terms will be available to us only if no events of default of any type exist and minimum debt service coverage ratio and debt yield requirements are satisfied  which requirements we currently do not satisfy 
the lehman financing  which matures in and is subject to a one year extension  totaled million as of december  and currently is secured by of our hotels 
the one year extension will be available only if  at the time of electing to extend and at the initial maturity date  no events of default of any type exist  and we pay an extension fee in the amount of million  if we are unable to refinance or extend the maturity of our maturing indebtedness  we may not otherwise be able to repay such indebtedness 
debt defaults could lead to us being forced to sell one or more of our hotels on unfavorable terms or  in the case of secured debt  convey the mortgaged hotel s to the lender  causing a loss of any anticipated income and cash flow from  and our invested capital in  such hotel s  all of our hotels are pledged as collateral under existing mortgage loans totaling million as of december   which represented of the book value of our hotel property  plant and equipment  net  as of december   and  as a result  we have limited flexibility to sell our hotels to satisfy cash needs  increased vulnerability to downturns in our business  the lodging industry and the general economy  our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required debt service payments  
table of contents our ability to obtain other financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements may be limited  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt service payments  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  and other needs and placing us at a competitive disadvantage with other companies that have greater resources and or less debt  our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry may be restricted  and we currently are  and may in the future be  unable to pay dividends on our common stock 
the terms of our debt instruments place many restrictions on us  which reduce operational flexibility and create default risks 
our outstanding debt instruments subject us to financial covenants  including leverage and coverage ratios 
our compliance with these covenants depends substantially upon the financial results of our hotels 
in particular  our debt agreements with merrill lynch mortgage  an affiliate of one of the underwriters  require a minimum debt yield and a minimum debt service coverage ratio 
the senior and mezzanine debt agreements with merrill lynch mortgage provide that when either i the debt yield for the trailing month period is below during the year ending november and if the loan is extended   and during each of the next three years of the loan  respectively or ii the debt service coverage ratio is below x  excess cash flows produced by the mortgaged hotels after payment of operating expenses  management fees  required reserves  service fees  principal and interest must be deposited in a restricted cash account 
these funds can be used for the prepayment of aggregate outstanding borrowings under these debt agreements  capital expenditures reasonably approved by the lender  and up to an aggregate million of scheduled principal and interest payments due under these agreements 
funds will no longer be deposited into the restricted cash account when the debt yield and the debt service coverage ratio are sustained above the minimum requirements for three consecutive months 
on march   the debt yield fell below the minimum threshold and  therefore  the excess cash flow produced by the mortgaged hotels was retained in the restricted cash account starting on may  the cash that was retained in the restricted cash account has since been released by merrill lynch mortgage for capital expenditures and scheduled principal and interest payments 
as of march   no cash was being retained in the restricted cash account 
however  the debt yield and the debt service coverage ratio continue to remain below the minimum requirements 
through our wholly owned subsidiaries  we owe approximately million under industrial revenue bonds secured by the holiday inns lawrence  kansas and manhattan  kansas hotels 
for the year ended december   the cash flows of the two hotels were insufficient to meet the minimum debt service coverage ratio requirements 
the trustee of the bonds may give notice of default  at which time we could remedy the default by depositing with the trustee an amount currently estimated at approximately million 
in the event a default is declared and not cured  the two hotels would be subject to foreclosure and we would be obligated to reimburse bondholders pursuant to a partial guaranty of approximately million 
in addition  we could be obligated to pay our franchisor liquidated damages in the amount of million 
on september   mortgage debt of approximately million of macon hotel associates  llc became due  which maturity has been extended to june  we own of macon hotel associates  and macon hotel associates sole asset is the crowne plaza hotel in macon  georgia 
we are attempting to refinance this debt and have escrowed foreclosure documents that will allow the lender to foreclose on the property on june  if our attempts are not successful 
if we are not able to refinance the debt and the lender does not grant further extensions  the property would be subject to foreclosure 
a foreclosure on the property would constitute a default of the franchise agreement  therefore  we may be liable for million in liquidated damages under the franchise agreement 

table of contents the restrictive covenants in our debt documents may reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and may limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest 
our failure to comply with our debt documents  including these restrictive covenants  may result in additional interest being due and would constitute an event of default  in some cases with notice or the lapse of time  that  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of the defaulted debt and the sale or foreclosure of the affected hotels 
as noted above  under certain circumstances the termination of a hotel franchise agreement could also result in the same effects 
a foreclosure would result in a loss of any anticipated income and cash flow from  and our invested capital in  the affected hotel 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to repay  through financings or otherwise  any accelerated indebtedness or that we will not lose all or a portion of our invested capital in any hotels that we sell in such circumstances 
rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and interest expense 
a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates 
in the future  we may incur additional indebtedness bearing interest at a variable rate  or we may be required to refinance our existing indebtedness at higher interest rates 
accordingly  increases in interest rates will increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow  reducing the amounts available to make payments on our indebtedness  fund our operations and our capital expenditure program  make acquisitions or pursue other business opportunities 
to service our indebtedness  we require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations  planned capital expenditures and other needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
various factors could adversely affect our ability to meet operating cash requirements  many of which are subject to the operating risks inherent in the lodging industry and therefore are beyond our control 
these risks include the following dependence on business and leisure travelers  which have been and continue to be affected by threats of terrorism  or other outbreaks of hostilities  and may otherwise fluctuate and be seasonal  cyclical overbuilding in the lodging industry  varying levels of demand for rooms and related services  competition from other hotels  motels and recreational properties  some of which may be owned or operated by companies having greater marketing and financial resources than we do  decreases in air travel  fluctuations in operating costs  changes in governmental laws and regulations that influence or determine wages or required remedial expenditures  changes in interest rates and the availability of credit  and the perception of the lodging industry and companies in the debt and equity markets 
the value of our hotels and repayment or refinancing of our debt are dependent upon the successful operation and cash flows of the hotels 
the value of our hotels is heavily dependent on their cash flows 
if cash flow declines  the hotel values could suffer impairment and the ability to repay or refinance our debt could also be adversely affected 
factors affecting the performance of our hotels include  but are not limited to  construction of competing hotels in the markets served by our hotels  loss of franchise affiliations  the need for renovations  the effectiveness of renovations or repositionings in attracting customers  changes in travel patterns and adverse economic conditions 

table of contents we may not be able to fund future capital needs  including necessary working capital  funds for capital expenditures or acquisition financing  from operating cash flows 
consequently  we may need to rely on third party sources to fund our capital needs 
we may not be able to obtain the financing on favorable terms or at all  which could materially and adversely affect us 
any additional debt we incur will increase our leverage  which would reduce our operational flexibility and increase our risk exposure 
our access to third party sources of capital depends  in part  on general market conditions  the market s perception of our growth potential  our current debt levels and property encumbrances  our current and expected future earnings  our cash flow and cash needs  and the market price per share of our common stock 
we may not be able to implement our growth strategy 
we compete for growth opportunities with national and regional hospitality companies  many of which have greater name recognition  marketing support and financial resources than we do 
our ability to make acquisitions and investments is dependent upon  among other things  our relationships with owners of existing hotels  our ability to identify suitable joint venture partners and to identify and consummate joint venture opportunities  financing acquisitions and successfully integrating new hotels into our operations 
we cannot assure you that suitable hotels for acquisition  investment  management  or rebranding  or a desired nationally recognized brand in a particular market  will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our failure to compete successfully for acquisitions  to finance those acquisitions on favorable terms  or to attract or maintain relationships with hotel owners and major hotel investors  or to achieve favorable returns on investments in hotel acquisitions  renovations and repositionings  could adversely affect our ability to expand our system of hotels 
an inability to implement our growth strategy successfully would limit our ability to grow our revenues  net income and cash flow 
our current and future joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on joint venture partners financial condition and performance and any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners 
we currently have an ownership interest in five of our hotels through joint ventures 
we anticipate that a significant portion of any future hotel acquisitions will be made through joint ventures  although no assurance can be given that we will identify suitable joint venture partners or opportunities or enter into joint venture agreements on favorable terms or at all 
we generally will not be in a position to exercise sole decision making authority regarding the hotels owned through such joint ventures 
investments in joint ventures may  under certain circumstances  involve risks not present when a third party is not involved  including the possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions 
joint venture partners may have business interests  strategies or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests  strategies or goals and may be  and in cases where we have a minority interest will be  in a position to take actions contrary to our policies  strategies or objectives 
joint venture investments also entail a risk of impasse on decisions  such as acquisitions or sales  because neither we nor our joint venture partner would have full control over the joint venture 
any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that could increase our expenses and could prevent our officers and or directors from focusing their time and effort exclusively on our business strategies 
consequently  actions by or disputes with our joint venture partners might result in subjecting hotels owned by the joint venture to additional risks 
in addition  we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party joint venture partners 
fresh start reporting will make future financial statements difficult to compare 
in accordance with the requirements of sop  financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code  we adopted fresh start reporting effective november  because sop 
table of contents required us to reset our assets and liabilities to current fair value  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows for periods ending after november  will not be comparable to the financial position  results of operations and cash flows reflected in our historical financial statements for periods ending on or prior to november  included elsewhere in this form k 
the use of fresh start reporting will make it difficult to assess our future prospects based on historical performance 
our prior bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect our operations going forward 
on december   lodgian and substantially all of our subsidiaries that owned hotels filed for voluntary reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
lodgian and affiliates owning hotels officially emerged from bankruptcy on november  however  the adverse publicity and news coverage regarding our chapter reorganization and financial condition and performance could adversely affect our operations going forward 
our bankruptcy filing had an adverse affect on our credit standing with our lenders  certain suppliers and other trade creditors 
this can increase our costs of doing business and can hinder our negotiating power with our lenders  certain suppliers and other trade creditors 
the failure to negotiate favorable terms could adversely affect us 
though we have emerged from chapter  the distribution of shares to the general unsecured creditors is not complete as we continue to reconcile the claims made by these creditors 
until this process is complete  we will continue to incur expenses with respect to the reorganization process 
we have a history of significant losses and we may not be able to successfully improve our performance to achieve profitability 
we incurred cumulative net losses of million from january  through december  and had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our ability to improve our performance to achieve profitability is dependent upon a recovery in the general economy  combined with an improvement in the lodging industry specifically  and the successful implementation of our business strategy 
our failure to improve our performance could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  cash flow  liquidity and prospects 
the economic downturn which commenced in early and the terrorist attacks of september  and the subsequent threat of terrorism resulted in a sharp decline in demand for hotels and continued to affect our results during and the lodging industry experienced some recovery during the second half of  but we were not able to benefit fully from the recovery due to deferred capital expenditures and renovation displacement at some of our hotels 
although smith travel research recently forecasted revpar growth for the us lodging industry in due to rising occupancy and rates and an improving economy  this forecast does not apply specifically to our portfolio of hotels 
as a result  we may not realize some or any of the benefits of that growth  particularly as some of our hotels are still under renovation and some need to be renovated 
acts and threats of terrorism  the ongoing war against terrorism  military conflicts and other factors have had a negative impact on and may continue to have a negative effect on the lodging industry and our results of operations 
the terrorist attacks of september  and the continued threat of terrorism  including changing threat levels announced by the department of homeland security  have had a negative impact on the lodging industry and on our hotel operations from the third quarter of to the present 
these events have caused a significant decrease in occupancy and adr in our hotels due to disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety 
in particular  major metropolitan area and airport hotels have been adversely affected by concerns about air travel safety and a significant overall decrease in the amount of air travel 
we believe the uncertainty associated with subsequent terrorist threats and incidents  military conflicts and the possibility of hostilities with other countries may continue to hamper business and leisure travel patterns and our hotel operations for the foreseeable future  and if these matters worsen the effects could become materially more adverse 

table of contents we may be unable to sell real estate  including our assets held for sale  in a timely manner or at expected prices 
we currently have hotels and three land parcels listed as assets available for sale  however  real estate assets generally cannot be sold quickly 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to sell one or more of these hotels on favorable terms or at all or that franchisor approval for transfer of a brand can be obtained when requested 
a franchisor may refuse to approve a transfer in its sole discretion 
furthermore  even if we are able to sell these hotels  we may not be able to realize any cash proceeds from the sales after paying off the related lenders 
additionally  we may not be able to sell these hotels in sufficient time to apply the proceeds to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service needs 
if a franchise agreement relating to a hotel is in default or is terminated by the franchisor  the value of the hotel could decline  perhaps substantially 
in the future  we may not be able to vary our portfolio of hotels or other real estate promptly in response to changes in hotel performance or economic or other conditions 
this inability to respond promptly could adversely affect us 
our expenses may remain constant or increase even if revenues decline 
the expenses of owning a hotel are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from the hotel 
we could be adversely affected by rising interest rate levels  the lack of available financing on favorable terms  or at all  to fund our working capital  debt service requirements  planned capital expenditures or other cash needs  increased costs associated with wages  employee benefits and taxes  property taxes  utilities and insurance  and changes in and the cost of compliance with government regulations  including those governing environmental  usage  zoning and tax matters 
we may make acquisitions or investments that are not successful and that adversely affect our ongoing operations 
we may acquire or make investments in hotel companies or hotel portfolios that we believe complement our business 
we lack experience in making these types of acquisitions 
as a result  our ability to identify prospects  conduct acquisitions and properly manage the integration of acquisitions is unproven 
if we fail to properly evaluate  execute and integrate hotel acquisitions or investments  we may be materially and adversely affected 
in making or attempting to make acquisitions or investments  we face a number of risks  including identifying suitable acquisition or investment candidates  performing appropriate due diligence  identifying potential liabilities and negotiating favorable terms for acquisitions and investments  reducing our working capital and hindering our ability to expand or maintain our business  including making capital expenditures and funding operations  the potential distraction of our management  diversion of our resources and disruption of our business  competing for acquisition opportunities with competitors that are larger than we are or have greater financing and other resources than we have  accurately forecasting the financial impact of an acquisition or investment  and effectively integrating acquired companies or investments and achieving expected performance 
losses may exceed our insurance coverage or estimated reserves 
we are self insured up to certain amounts with respect to our insurance coverages 
should a material uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur with respect to any particular property  we could lose our capital invested in the property  as well as the anticipated income and cash flow from the property and  in the case of debt which is with recourse to us  would remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
we cannot assure you that material losses in excess of insurance coverage or estimated reserves will not occur in the future or that we will not be required to pay a significant deductible 
table of contents for such coverage 
any such loss would have an adverse effect on us 
in addition  if we are unable to maintain insurance that meets our debt and franchise agreement requirements  and if we are unable to amend or waive those requirements  it could have a material adverse effect on us 
competition in the lodging industry could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
there is no single competitor or small number of competitors that are dominant in the lodging industry 
we generally operate in areas that contain numerous other competitors  some of which may have substantially greater resources than we have 
competitive factors in the lodging industry include  among others  supply in a particular market  franchise affiliation  reasonableness of room rates  quality of accommodations  service levels  convenience of locations and amenities customarily offered to the traveling public 
there can be no assurance that demographic  geographic or other changes in markets will not adversely affect the convenience or desirability of the locales in which our hotels operate  competing hotels will not pose greater competition for guests than presently exists  or that new hotels will not enter such locales 
new or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates or greater conveniences  services or amenities or significantly expand or improve existing facilities or introduce new facilities in markets in which we compete 
any of these factors could materially and adversely affect us 
adverse conditions in markets in which we do substantial amounts of business  such as our four largest markets of baltimore washington  dc  pittsburgh  buffalo niagara falls and phoenix  could negatively affect our results of operations 
our operating results depend upon our ability to achieve and maintain adequate room rates and occupancy levels in our hotels 
adverse economic or other conditions in markets  such as pittsburgh  in which we have multiple hotels may negatively affect our occupancy and adr  which in turn would negatively affect our revenue and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our hotels located in baltimore washington  dc  pittsburgh  buffalo niagara falls and phoenix provided an aggregate of approximately of our consolidated revenues and contained an aggregate of approximately of our total available rooms during the year ended december  as a result of this geographic concentration of our hotels in these markets  we are particularly exposed to the risks of downturns in these local economies and to other local conditions  which could adversely affect the operating results of our hotels in these markets 
the lodging business is seasonal 
demand for accommodations  and the resulting cash flow  vary seasonally 
the high season tends to be the summer months for hotels located in colder climates and the winter months for hotels located in warmer climates 
aggregate demand for accommodations at the hotels in our portfolio is  however  lowest during the winter months 
levels of demand are dependent upon many factors that are beyond our control  including general and local economic conditions and changes in levels of leisure and business related travel 
our hotels depend on both business and leisure travelers for revenues 
additionally  our hotels operate in areas that contain numerous other competitive lodging facilities 
we have experienced significant changes in our senior management team 
there have been a number of changes in our senior management team during the last two years and since our emergence from bankruptcy 
our chief executive officer was hired in july and our chief financial officer and our chief operating officer were promoted to their positions in october and may  respectively 
if our new management team is unable to develop successful business strategies  achieve our business objectives or maintain effective relationships with employees  suppliers  creditors and customers  our ability to grow our business and successfully meet operational challenges could be impaired 
if we lose or are unable to obtain key personnel  our ability to effectively operate our business could be hindered 
our ability to maintain or enhance our competitive position will depend to a significant extent on the efforts and ability of our executive and senior management  particularly our chief executive officer 
our future 
table of contents success and our ability to manage future growth will depend in large part upon the efforts of our management team and on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel 
competition for personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining our personnel 
our inability to retain our current management team and attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could hinder our business 
the increasing use of third party travel websites by consumers may adversely affect our profitability 
some of our hotel rooms are booked through third party travel websites such as travelocity 
com  expedia 
com  priceline 
com and hotels 
com 
if these internet bookings increase  these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions  reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from us 
moreover  some of these internet travel intermediaries are attempting to offer hotel rooms as a commodity  by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality such as three star downtown hotel at the expense of brand identification 
we believe that the goal of these internet intermediaries is to have consumers eventually develop brand loyalties to their reservation systems rather than to our brands 
although most of the business for our hotels is expected to be derived from traditional channels  if the amount of sales made through internet intermediaries increases significantly  room revenues may flatten or decrease and our profitability may be adversely affected 
we may be unable to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had approximately million of historical net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent that we do not have sufficient future taxable income to offset these net operating loss carryforwards  unused losses will expire between and our ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income is also subject to annual limitations 
an audit or review by the internal revenue service could result in the reduction in the net operating loss carryforwards available to us 
aspects of our operations are subject to government regulation  and changes in government regulations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
a number of states and local governments regulate the licensing of hotels and restaurants  including occupancy and liquor license grants  by requiring registration  disclosure statements and compliance with specific standards of conduct 
occupancy licenses are obtained prior to the opening of a hotel but may require renewal if there is a major renovation 
we believe that our hotels are substantially in compliance with these requirements or  in the case of liquor licenses  that they have or will promptly obtain the appropriate licenses 
operators of hotels also are subject to employment laws  including minimum wage requirements  overtime  working conditions and work permit requirements 
compliance with  or changes in  these laws could increase the cost of operating the affected hotels and or reduce the revenue from our hotels and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
under the americans with disabilities act  or ada  all public accommodations are required to meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
these requirements became effective in although we have invested and continue to invest significant amounts in connection with ada required upgrades to our hotels  a determination that any of our hotels are not in compliance with the ada could result in a judicial order requiring compliance  imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations could adversely affect operating results 
under various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for noncompliance with applicable environmental and health and safety requirements and for the costs of investigation  monitoring  removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances 
these laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of these hazardous or toxic substances on a property could also result in personal injury or property damage or similar claims by private parties 
in addition  the presence of contamination  or the failure to report  investigate or properly remediate contaminated property  may adversely affect the operation of the property or the owner s ability to sell or rent the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of those 
table of contents substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not that facility is or ever was owned or operated by that person 
the operation and removal of underground storage tanks also are regulated by federal  state and local laws 
in connection with the ownership and operation of our hotels  we could be held liable for the costs of remedial action for regulated substances and storage tanks and related claims 
some of our hotels contain asbestos containing building materials  or acbms 
environmental laws require that acbms be properly managed and maintained  and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements 
third parties may be permitted by law to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to contaminants  including  but not limited to  acbms 
operation and maintenance programs have been developed for those hotels which are known to contain acbms 
many  but not all  of our hotels have undergone phase i environmental site assessments  which generally provide a nonintrusive physical inspection and database search  but not soil or groundwater analyses  by a qualified independent environmental consultant 
the purpose of a phase i assessment is to identify potential sources of contamination for which the hotel owner or others may be responsible 
none of the phase i environmental site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on us 
nevertheless  it is possible that these assessments did not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns or that material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns exist of which we are currently unaware 
some of our hotels may contain microbial matter such as mold  mildew and viruses 
the presence of microbial matter could adversely affect our results of operations 
phase i assessments performed on certain of our hotels in connection with our recent refinancings identified mold in four of our hotels 
we have completed all necessary remediation for these properties 
in addition  if any hotel in our portfolio is not properly connected to a water or sewer system  or if the integrity of such systems are breached  microbial matter or other contamination can develop 
if this were to occur  we could incur significant remedial costs and we may also be subject to private damage claims and awards 
any liability resulting from noncompliance or other claims relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on us and our insurability for such matters in the future 
risks related to our common stock our common stock could be de listed from the american stock exchange if the listing standards are not maintained 
the rules of the american stock exchange allow the exchange to de list securities if it determines that a company s securities fail to meet its guidelines in respect of corporate net worth  public float  number of shareholders  aggregate market value of shares or price per share 
we cannot assure purchasers of our common stock that we will continue to meet the american stock exchange listing requirements 
if our common stock is delisted from the american stock exchange  it would likely trade on the otc bulletin board  which is a quotation service for securities that are not listed or traded on a national securities exchange 
the otc bulletin board is viewed by most investors as less desirable and a less liquid marketplace 
thus  delisting from the american stock exchange could result in investors being unable to liquidate their investment or make trading our shares more difficult or expensive for investors  leading to declines in share price 
it would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital 
in addition  we would incur additional costs under state blue sky laws to sell equity if our common stock is not traded on a national securities exchange 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could decline and fluctuate significantly in response to various factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  announcements of new services or products or significant price reductions by us or our competitors  
table of contents market performance by our competitors  future issuances of our common stock  or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock  by us directly  or the perception that such issuances are likely to occur  sales of our common stock by stockholders or the perception that such sales may occur in the future  the size of our market capitalization  loss of our franchises  default on our indebtedness and or foreclosure of our properties  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and domestic and international economic  legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance 
we may never pay dividends on our common stock  in which event purchasers only return on their investment  if any  will occur on the sale of our common stock 
we have not yet paid any dividends on our common stock  and we do not intend to do so in the foreseeable future 
as a result  a purchaser s only return on its investment  if any  will occur on the sale of our common stock 
our charter documents  employment contracts and delaware law may impede attempts to replace or remove our management or inhibit a takeover  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware corporate law  contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in our management or a change of control that you might consider favorable and may prevent you from receiving a takeover premium for your shares 
these provisions include  for example authorizing the issuance of preferred stock  the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the board of directors  establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at meetings  and requiring all stockholder action to be taken at a duly called meeting  not by written consent 
in addition  we have entered  or will enter  into employment contracts with certain of our employees that contain change of control provisions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our variable rate debt 
at december  and december   we had outstanding variable rate debt of approximately million and million  respectively 
in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on the us portion of the exit financing received in november million and million at december  and december   respectively  we entered into two interest rate cap agreements  which allowed us to obtain exit financing at floating rates and effectively cap them at libor of plus the spread see liquidity and capital resources 
thus  we will earn periodic settlement payments under our interest rate caps when libor exceeds at specified intervals set forth in the caps  which generally coincide with the dates on which interest is payable on the underlying debt 
when libor is below  there is no settlement from the interest rate caps 
therefore  we are exposed to interest rate risks on the exit financing debt for increases in libor up to but we are not exposed to increases in libor above because settlements from the interest rate caps would offset the incremental interest expense 
the one month libor as of december  was 
the notional principal amount of the interest rate caps outstanding was million and million at december  and at december   respectively 
on may   we finalized an million financing with lehman 
the lehman financing is a two year term loan with an optional one year extension and bears interest at the higher of or libor plus 
in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the lehman financing  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement  which allowed us to obtain this financing at a partial floating rate and effectively caps the interest rate at libor of plus 
when libor exceeds  the contracts require settlement of net interest receivable at specified intervals  which generally coincide with the dates on which interest is payable on the underlying debt 
when libor is below  there is no settlement from the interest rate cap 
we are exposed to interest rate risks on the lehman financing for libor of between and 
the notional principal amount of the interest rate cap outstanding was million at december  with respect to the fair market value of the three interest rate caps  the two related to the exit financing and the one related to the lehman financing  we believe that our interest rate risk at december  and december  was minimal 
the impact on annual results of operations of a hypothetical one point interest rate reduction on the interest rate caps as of december  would be a reduction in net income of approximately  these derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are entered into for hedging purposes only 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  we have not elected to follow the hedging requirements of sfas no 
the fair value of the three interest rate caps as of december  and the two interest rate caps at december  were approximately  and  respectively 
the fair values of the interest rate caps were recognized on the balance sheet in other assets 
adjustments to the carrying values of the interest rate caps are reflected in interest expense 
the nature of our fixed rate obligations does not expose us to fluctuations in interest payments 
the impact on the fair value of our fixed rate obligations of a hypothetical one point interest rate increase on the outstanding fixed rate debt as of december  and december  would be a reduction in value  to the holders of the debt  approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the hotel business is inherently capital intensive and the hotels which constitute the vast majority of assets are long lived 
lodgian s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations 
approximately of the long term mortgage debt including current portion carries floating rates of interest 
for the balance of long term debt  the nature of fixed rate obligations does not expose us to the risk of changes in the fair value of these instruments 
our outstanding debt was million  at december   including current maturities and long term debt related to assets held for sale
