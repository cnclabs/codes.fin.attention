item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents overview we operate surgery centers and private surgical hospitals in the united states and western europe 
as of december   we operated facilities  consisting of in the united states  nine in spain  and three in the united kingdom 
of the us facilities  are jointly owned with major not for profit healthcare systems 
overall  as of december   we held ownership interests in of the facilities and operated the remaining two facilities under management contracts 
we have grown rapidly  as reflected in the increase of our revenues from million for the year ended december   our first full year in operation  to million for the year ended december  this growth during our initial years of operations was primarily driven by the acquisition and construction of new facilities 
while we continue to construct new facilities and to selectively acquire existing facilities  much of our growth in resulted from increased revenues at our existing facilities 
approximately of our facilities are located in the united states  where we partner with surgeons and often with not for profit healthcare systems to operate ambulatory surgery centers and private surgical hospitals collectively short stay surgical facilities 
due in part to advancements in medical technology  the number of surgeries performed in an outpatient  or ambulatory  setting has steadily increased for more than two decades 
ambulatory surgery centers  which specialize in these non emergency surgical cases  are able to perform more surgeries and at lower cost than acute care hospitals 
these efficiencies make short stay surgical facilities attractive to physicians  who can perform more surgeries  and to payors  who can reimburse such facilities at lower rates than acute care hospitals 
we share ownership with local physicians in all of our us facilities  except for two where we hold no ownership  and additionally earn a monthly fee for managing the operations of each facility 
increasingly  we also share ownership with a not for profit healthcare system hospital partner  which we believe helps us more quickly establish relationships with physicians  communities  suppliers  and payors 
our success thus far with these three way partnerships  measured in terms of adding facilities  increasing revenues  and improving operating margins  has made relationships with hospital partners an increasingly prominent part of our strategy 
at december   we had such relationships  a number that has doubled in the past two years  which now encompass of our us facilities 
in spain and the united kingdom we operate private hospitals 
both countries have government sponsored health care  but waiting lists resulting from delays to access diagnostic procedures as well as to have elective surgery at government sponsored facilities are driving an increasing number of patients to use our facilities  paying for procedures either from personal funds or through private insurance  offered by an increasing number of employers as a benefit to their employees 
since the demand for health care services exceeds the capacity of government sponsored facilities  our facilities also supplement the national health services as public hospitals periodically refer overload cases to our facilities 
we have expanded selectively in these two countries  having most recently constructed a cancer treatment facility at one of our three hospitals in the london area 
our continued growth and success depends on our ability to continue to grow volumes at our existing facilities  to successfully open new facilities we develop  and to maintain productive relationships with our hospital partners 
we have significant opportunities to operate more facilities with hospital partners in the future  particularly if we are able to expand our existing relationships to include more of the geographic markets in which our partners operate  but also through the initiation of new relationships with hospital partners 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals 
our management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
they 
table of contents also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period 
estimates are based on information available as of the date financial statements are prepared and accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the following critical accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our financial statements than others  due to the size of the underlying financial statement elements 
consolidation generally  we do not wholly own the facilities we operate 
as discussed in results of operations  we operate a majority of our facilities through joint ventures with physicians 
increasingly  these joint ventures also include a not for profit healthcare system as a partner 
we generally have a leadership role in these facilities through a significant voting and economic interest and a contract to manage each facility s operations  but the degree of control we have varies from facility to facility 
accordingly we consolidate the financial results of of the facilities we operate  including one in which we hold no ownership but control its operations through a long term service agreement  and account for the other under the equity method 
we hold no ownership in the other facility  which we currently operate under a management contract but do not control 
in addition  we account for passive investments  which represent less than of our investment in unconsolidated affiliates  under the cost method 
our determination of the appropriate consolidation method to follow with respect to our investments in subsidiaries and affiliates is based on the amount of control we have  combined with our ownership level  in the underlying entity 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and other subsidiaries over which we have control 
our investments in subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but do not control including subsidiaries where we have less than ownership are accounted for on the equity method 
all of our other investments are accounted for on the cost method 
accounting for an investment as consolidated versus equity method generally has no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period  but does impact individual income statement and balance sheet balances  as consolidation effectively grosses up our income statement and balance sheet 
however  if control or influence aspects of an equity method investment were different  it could result in us being required to account for an investment by consolidation or using the cost method 
under the cost method  the investor does not record its share of income or losses of the investee until it receives dividends or distributions from the investee 
conversely  under either consolidation or equity method accounting  the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss based on its ownership percentage 
at december   million of the company s total investment in unconsolidated affiliates of million relates to investments that are accounted for using the cost method and the remaining million represents investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for using the equity method 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as updated  which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue is recognized existence of persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria 
our revenues that are subject to the most judgment are those patient service revenues that are not generated under contracted or government mandated fee schedules or discount arrangements 
approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december  were generated by noncontracted and nongovernment payors 
the allowances that we record for these revenues are based on our best estimates of expected actual reimbursement based primarily on historical collections for similar transactions 
the collection cycle for patient services revenue is relatively short  typically ranging from to days depending upon payor and geographic norms  which allows us to evaluate our estimates frequently 
our revenues earned under management and other service contracts are typically based upon objective formulas driven by an entity s financial performance and are generally earned and paid monthly 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
if  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
intangible assets we also consider our accounting policy regarding intangible assets to be a critical accounting policy given the significance of intangible assets as compared to our total assets and the recent changes in accounting for intangible assets required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which was issued by the financial accounting standards board on july  and was adopted by us as of january  sfas no 
requires the cessation of amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that goodwill and all intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually 
we adopted this standard on january   determining that our reporting units are at the operating segment country level  and that the majority of our intangible assets  which consist primarily of contracts to manage certain facilities  have indefinite useful lives 
most of our management contracts have evergreen renewal provisions that do not contemplate a specific termination date 
some of the contracts have provisions which make it possible for the facility s other owners to terminate them at certain dates and under certain circumstances 
based on our history with these contracts  we consider their useful lives to be indefinite and therefore we do not amortize them unless facts and circumstances indicate that it is no longer considered likely that a contract can be renewed without substantial cost 
neither the transitional impairment tests performed as of january   nor the annual tests for impairment performed in and  identified any impairment of the carrying value of any reporting unit or of any indefinite lived intangible assets 
in addition  we continue to review the carrying values of amortizable intangible assets whenever facts and circumstances change in a manner that indicates their carrying values may not be recoverable 
acquisitions  equity investments and development projects during  three surgery centers and one surgical hospital developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
during june  we acquired a interest in an ambulatory surgery center in austin  texas for million in cash 
during april  we acquired a private surgical hospital in london  england for approximately million million  of which the payment of approximately million million remains deferred pending the resolution of certain contingencies 

table of contents in march  we acquired a private surgical hospital in marbella  spain  for approximately million million in cash 
in addition  we agreed to pay up to an additional total of million million  depending on the resolution of certain contingencies over the next four years 
we also engage in investing transactions that are not business combinations  consisting primarily of purchases and sales of noncontrolling equity interests in surgical facilities and the investment of additional cash in surgical facilities under development 
during the year ended december   these transactions resulted in net cash outflows totaling million  of which million was paid to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a surgery center in torrance  california  million was paid to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a recently constructed facility in dallas  texas  and million of previously deferred purchase price was paid to the former owners of a facility in a suburb of dallas  texas based on the financial performance of that facility 
during the year ended december   these transactions resulted in net cash outflows of million 
the most notable transactions were acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in surgery centers in the following markets austintown  ohio  destin  florida  east brunswick  new jersey  through a newly formed joint venture with robert wood johnson university hospital  and atlanta  georgia 
in addition  in december we made an advance payment of million to the sellers of the torrance  california facility that increased our ownership level in that center from the noncontrolling interest we acquired earlier in to a controlling interest  effective january  during  four surgery centers and two private surgical hospitals developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
in december  we acquired an additional of a surgery center in torrance  california  in which we had previously been a minority owner  for million in cash  bringing our total ownership in the facility to as of december  and triggering our consolidation of the facility in our financial statements 
in october  we acquired an interest in a surgery center in lyndhurst  ohio  for million in cash 
in august  with an effective date of july   we acquired an additional interest in a surgery center in arlington  texas arlington for total consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million of our common stock  bringing our total ownership interest in the center to 
because we own a majority of a subsidiary that owns a majority of the surgery center and maintains effective control through this ownership interest and through our operation of the center pursuant to a management contract  we consolidated the results of arlington s operations in our financial statements 
in june  we acquired a interest in a surgery center in middleburg heights  ohio  a suburb of cleveland  for million in cash 
in may  we acquired a interest in a surgery center in corpus christi  texas for million in cash 
in march  we acquired surgicoe corporation  which owned  managed  and developed surgical facilities in georgia  oklahoma  and texas 
we paid the shareholders of surgicoe approximately million in cash 
the terms of the agreement provide for us to make additional payments in the future should certain facilities  including some that are operational and some that are currently under development  meet specified performance targets 
in february  we acquired a surgical hospital in murcia  spain  for total consideration of approximately million in cash of which million was paid upon the consummation of the acquisition and million was paid on the first anniversary of the consummation of the acquisition and approximately million in assumed capital lease obligations 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  we acquired ownership interests in four surgery centers through separate transactions 
in october  we acquired a interest in a surgical facility in sarasota  florida for a total consideration of approximately million in cash and approximately million in assumed debt 
during november  we completed two acquisitions an interest in a surgical facility in west covina  california los angeles area for total consideration of approximately million in cash and approximately million in assumed debt and an interest in a surgical facility in fredericksburg  virginia  for total consideration of approximately million in cash  a warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock at a price equal to approximately per share and approximately  in assumed debt 
in december  we expanded our presence in the los angeles area by acquiring a interest in a surgical facility in torrance  california for total consideration of approximately million 
during july  we acquired a controlling interest in a surgery center in fort worth  texas for approximately million in cash 
we had previously operated this surgery center under a management contract 
in addition  in july and august  we opened newly developed surgery centers in knoxville  tennessee  and lawrenceville  georgia 
on february   we completed a merger with ortholink 
the transaction was funded through the issuance of  shares of our common stock to ortholink stockholders 
ortholink was incorporated in and  as of february   held a direct or indirect ownership interest in eight surgery centers 
we also held an ownership interest in and managed one of these centers 
ortholink managed six of the eight surgery centers in which it held an ownership interest and managed two additional surgery centers in which it had no ownership interest 
in addition  ortholink has service agreements with physician groups in several states 
ortholink s physician practice management operations are not  and are not expected to be in the future  a material part of our business 
sources of revenue revenues primarily include net patient service revenue for the facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes  which are typically those in which we have ownership interests of greater than or otherwise maintain effective control  management and administrative services revenue earned from management contracts  whereby we manage the operations of surgical facilities in which we have varying levels of ownership  and from contracts to provide consulting and specific administrative services to physicians 
management services revenue and expenses earned from and incurred by facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes are eliminated in consolidation and therefore not included in management services revenue or operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and accordingly have no impact on consolidated net income  and our share of the net income or loss of the unconsolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method of accounting 
these amounts are included in revenues as these operations are central to our business strategy 
through our contracts to manage these facilities  we have an active role in their operations 
the level of our corporate resources devoted to fulfilling these responsibilities is significant and generally equal to that devoted to the operations of the facilities we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 

table of contents the following table summarizes our revenues by type and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated years ended december  net patient service revenue management and administrative services revenue equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates other income total revenue the percentage of our total revenues attributable to management and administrative services decreased to and in and from in primarily as a result of the additional net patient service revenue resulting from our acquiring controlling interests in additional surgical facilities during all three years 
our management and administrative services revenues are earned from the following types of activities years ended december  management of surgical facilities consulting and other services provided to physicians and related entities total management and administrative service revenues the majority of our management and administrative services revenue earned from providing services to physicians and related entities resulted from our acquisition of ortholink physicians corporation ortholink on february  our results for the year ended december  include only ten and one half months of ortholink operations

table of contents our weighted average percentage ownership in our unconsolidated affiliates calculated based on the total debt of each affiliate multiplied by the percentage ownership uspi held in the affiliate as of the end of each respective year 
the following table summarizes our revenues by operating segment years ended december  united states western europe total the geographic location of our acquisition and development activities during and was the primary determinant in the changes in proportions of revenue we earned from each operating segment 
from december  to december   the number of us facilities we operated increased from to  while the number of western europe facilities we operated remained at ten 
from december  to december   we only added two western europe facilities  as compared to eight us facilities  but both of the western europe facilities are consolidated for financial reporting purposes  which results in of their revenues being included in our consolidated revenues 
in contrast  only three consolidated us facilities were added from december  to december   and us facilities are generally smaller than our facilities in western europe 
results of operations the following table summarizes certain statements of income items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  total revenues operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization operating income minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries interest and other expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income ebitda less minority interests

the increases in revenue are driven most significantly by growth in our existing facilities 
facilities that we owned in both and same store facilities continued the trend from earlier years of performing more surgical cases than in the prior year  and our facilities also received higher rates of reimbursement per case  on average  than in the prior year 
in addition  we continued to add new hospital partners  to construct new facilities  and to selectively add facilities through acquisition 
increases in the volume of surgical cases in the us and of patient admissions for our hospitals in western europe continue to drive increases in our revenues  as does an increase in the average reimbursement for the surgeries in all countries and other services in western europe that we provide 
these factors impacted revenue less favorably in than in the preceding two years  which is primarily a result of increases in the number of facilities we operate 
the increase in the overall number of facilities 
table of contents causes the relatively high growth rates in our newer facilities to have a less dramatic impact on our overall same store case volumes  as reflected in the following table 
years ended december  united states facilities surgical cases net revenue per case total western europe facilities net revenue using actual exchange rates net revenue using constant exchange rates measures current year using prior year exchange rates 
of this amount  relates to ambulatory surgery centers and to surgical hospitals 
the addition of new facilities continues to be more heavily weighted to us surgical facilities with a not for profit healthcare system partner hospital partner  both as we initiate joint venture agreements with new systems and as we add facilities to our arrangements with existing systems 
facilities have been added to hospital joint ventures both through construction of new facilities de novos and through our contribution of our equity interests in existing facilities into a hospital joint venture structure  effectively creating three way joint ventures by sharing our ownership in these facilities with a hospital partner while leaving the existing physician ownership intact 
we also have selectively added facilities in western europe through acquisition and construction 
the following table summarizes our facilities as of december    and hospital partners united states facilities with a hospital partner without a hospital partner total us facilities western europe facilities total facilities operated change from prior year end de novo newly constructed acquisition total at december   physicians own a portion of all of these facilities 
operating expenses have increased at lower rates than revenue  resulting in improved operating margins 
this relationship results from the double digit percentage growth in same store revenues exceeding the volume driven and inflation driven increases in most operating expenses  including the costs of personnel  supplies  and facility costs  and also  we believe  from our implementing uspi s edge in 
table of contents newly acquired facilities  which we believe improves operating efficiencies 
the following table summarizes changes in our same store ebitda margins years ended december  united states facilities with a hospital partner bps bps bps without a hospital partner total us facilities western europe facilities bps bps bps ebitda margin is calculated as ebitda divided by total revenues 
this table aggregates all of the facilities we operate using of their results 
this does not represent the overall margin for uspi s operations in either the us or western europe because we have a variety of ownership levels in the facilities we operate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was contributed by same store facilities  million was contributed by new facilities  and million was due to exchange rate fluctuations 
the same store increase was primarily driven by a million increase in revenue at us facilities  which performed approximately more surgical cases and received an average of approximately more per case in than in the revenues of same store western europe facilities  when measured using exchange rates for both periods  were million higher in than in facilities acquired since december   and thus not owned for the same number of months in as compared to  contributed net additional revenues in of million 
the exchange rate fluctuations reflect the million impact of the us dollar being weaker relative to the eurodollar and british pound in than in operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to from  primarily as a result of increasing revenue base  operating efficiencies at our facilities and improved economies of scale as we expanded 
included in operating expenses is equity based compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
without the increase in this amount  which was driven most significantly by the increase in uspi s stock price during  operating expenses would have been of revenues for the year ended december  operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of improved operating margins at our facilities and the leveraging of our corporate overhead expenses over the increased revenue being partially offset by the increase in equity based compensation 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this amount increased due primarily as a result of depreciation of assets added through acquisitions and newly opened facilities 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to our increased revenue 

table of contents interest expense  net of interest income  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our borrowing a portion of the costs of acquiring and developing facilities 
other expense  net of other income decreased million  or  to million of other income for the year ended december  from million of other expense for the year ended december   primarily due to the million impairment of investment securities recorded in minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of our hospital joint venture strategy 
during  our hospital partners in three markets gained additional ownership in certain of our facilities as part of our development strategy 
provision for income taxes of million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  we continue to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset current period income in spain  which makes our effective tax rate slightly lower than it would be were we to accrue taxes at statutory rates in all three countries in which we operate 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million improvement results primarily from the increased revenues and improved economies of scale related to expenses discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was contributed by facilities acquired or opened since december  the us dollar was weaker relative to the eurodollar and the british pound during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year  resulting in a positive impact of million on year over year revenues for the facilities in western europe that we owned in both and same store facilities 
absent this foreign exchange impact  same store facilities in western europe contributed million more to consolidated revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the remaining increase in revenues was contributed principally by same store us facilities  which performed approximately more cases during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to from  primarily as a result of increasing revenue base  operating efficiencies at our facilities and improved economies of scale as we expanded 
operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating income  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of improved operating margins at our facilities and the leveraging of our corporate overhead expenses over the increased revenue 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this amount remained virtually constant because the reduction in expense resulting from the cessation of goodwill amortization required under sfas no 
largely offset the additional depreciation on tangible assets acquired through acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to our increased revenue 

table of contents interest expense  net of interest income  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of higher levels of outstanding debt during the year ended december  than during the prior year period 
we used a portion of the proceeds of our two public offerings of common stock to repay senior and subordinated indebtedness in june and have incurred debt to fund a portion of our acquisition and development program since that time 
other expense  net of other income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the million loss on early retirement of debt recorded in being so much larger than the million impairment of investment securities recorded in provision for income taxes was a net expense of million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   compared to a net benefit of million  representing a negative effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the increase in our actual provision for income taxes and in our overall effective tax rate primarily results from our accruing no net federal tax expense related to us operations prior to january   at which time we began accruing taxes at rates approximating statutory rates 
we utilized net operating loss carryforwards nols to offset current period income as our us operations achieved profitability for the first time during  and during the fourth quarter of we fully recognized the benefit of all us nols generated during our initial years of operations 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million improvement results primarily from the increased revenues and improved economies of scale related to expenses discussed above 
ebitda less minority interest increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase in ebitda less minority interest  million was contributed by facilities acquired or opened since december  ebitda less minority interest  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of improved operating margins at our facilities and the leveraging of our corporate overhead expenses over the increased revenue 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated million of cash flows from operations as compared to million during and million during included in the million is a benefit of million  which is not expected to recur  resulting from our modifying contracts under which we provide certain administrative services to physicians  eliminating the financing of accounts receivable from the scope of services we provide 
during the year ended december   our net cash required for investing activities was million  consisting primarily of million for the purchase of businesses and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
the million primarily represents purchases of new businesses  net of cash received  and incremental investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the most significant of these transactions were million paid to acquire a private surgical hospital in marbella  spain  million paid to acquire a private surgical hospital in london  england  million paid to acquire a majority interest in a surgery center in austin  texas  million paid to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a surgery center in torrance  california  
table of contents million paid to acquire a noncontrolling interest in a recently constructed surgery center in dallas  texas  million of deferred purchase price paid to the former owners of a facility in a suburb of dallas  texas  based on the financial performance of that facility 
in addition to these transactions  we made an advance payment in late december of approximately million to acquire a controlling interest  effective january   in the torrance facility we had acquired a noncontrolling interest in earlier in approximately million of the property and equipment purchases related to ongoing development projects  and the remaining million primarily represents purchases of equipment at existing facilities 
the million of cash used in investing activities was funded primarily with the cash flows from operations noted above and additionally through a reduction of cash on hand together with new borrowings 
net cash provided during the year ended december  by financing activities totaled million and resulted primarily from our investees financing a portion of their capital expenditures 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december  and net working capital was million at december  as compared to million in the prior year 
the decreases in cash and cash equivalents and in working capital from december  to december  were primarily due to the proceeds of an october stock offering being fully deployed by december  during november  we entered into a revolving credit facility with a group of commercial lenders providing us with the ability to borrow up to million for acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the united states and spain or for the funding of any new subsidiary that becomes a guarantor of the facility 
under the terms of the facility  we may invest up to a total of million in subsidiaries that are not guarantors  including subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
borrowings under our credit facility mature on november  as of december   no amounts were outstanding under this facility and million was available for borrowing based on actual reported consolidated financial results 
maximum availability under the facility is based upon pro forma ebitda  including ebitda from acquired entities 
assuming historical purchase multiples of annual ebitda of potential acquisition targets  approximately million would be available for borrowing to finance acquisitions as of december   of which none was drawn at december  our credit facility agreement and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes contain various restrictive covenants including covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to borrow money or guarantee other indebtedness  grant liens on our assets  make investments  use assets as security in other transactions  pay dividends on stock  enter into sale and leaseback transactions or sell assets or capital stock 
our credit agreement in the united kingdom provides for total borrowings of million approximately million as of december  under four separate facilities 
at december   total outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement were approximately million which represents total borrowings net of scheduled repayments of million that have been made under the agreement  and approximately million was available for borrowing  primarily for capital projects specified in the agreement 
borrowings under the united kingdom credit facility bear interest at rates of to over libor and mature in april we pledged the capital stock of our uk subsidiaries to secure borrowings under the united kingdom credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreements as of december  in october  we received  after offering costs of approximately million  net proceeds of approximately million from an offering of  shares of our common stock  which included  shares attributable to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
in december  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of million after offering costs of million and a discount of million 
the notes  which mature on december   accrue interest at payable semi annually on june and december commencing on june  and were issued at a discount of million  resulting in an effective 
table of contents interest rate of 
the senior subordinated notes are subordinate to all senior indebtedness and are guaranteed by uspi and uspi s wholly owned subsidiaries domiciled in the united states 
the company may redeem all or part of the notes on or after december  upon not less than nor more than days notice 
the redemption price would be the following percentages of principal amount  if redeemed during the month period commencing on december of the years set forth below period redemption price in addition  before december   if the company completes an offering of its stock in an amount of at least million  the company may use the proceeds of the offering to  on one or more occasions  redeem notes in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed of the total notes outstanding at a redemption price of of principal 
the company may also redeem the notes at any time prior to december   by paying the principal amount of all outstanding notes plus the greater of a of the principal amount or b the excess of the present value of the notes and all interest that would accrue through december  over the principal amount of the notes 
the company is obligated to offer to purchase the notes at of the principal amount upon the occurrence of certain change of control events 
any redemptions of the notes require payment of all amounts of accrued but unpaid interest 

table of contents our contractual cash obligations as of december  may be summarized as follows payments due by period beyond contractual cash obligations total within year to years to years years in thousands long term debt obligations principal plus interest senior subordinated notes us credit facility uk credit facility loans from former owners of subsidiaries other debt at operating subsidiaries capitalized lease obligations us operating subsidiaries western europe operating subsidiaries operating lease obligations us operating subsidiaries western europe operating subsidiaries total contractual cash obligations amounts shown for long term debt obligations and capital lease obligations include the associated interest 
for variable rate debt  the interest is calculated using the december  rates applicable to each debt instrument 
the amounts shown for the us credit facility are the commitment fees assuming no amounts are drawn under the agreement 
if we draw amounts under this agreement  the commitment fees would be less but we would incur cash obligations related to interest and principal repayments 
our operating subsidiaries  many of which have minority owners who share in the cash flow of these entities  have debt consisting primarily of capitalized lease obligations 
this debt is generally non recourse to uspi  the parent company  and is generally secured by the assets of those operating entities 
the total amount of these obligations  which was million at december   is included in our consolidated balance sheet because the borrower or obligated entity meets the requirements for consolidated financial reporting 
our average percentage ownership  weighted based on the individual subsidiary s amount of debt and capitalized leased obligations  of these consolidated subsidiaries was at december  additionally  our unconsolidated affiliates that we account for under the equity method have debt and capitalized lease obligations that are generally non recourse to uspi and are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   the total obligations of these unconsolidated affiliates under debt and capital lease obligations was approximately million 
our average percentage ownership  weighted based on the individual affiliate s amount of debt and capitalized lease obligations  of these unconsolidated affiliates was at december  uspi or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries had collectively guaranteed million of the million in total debt and capital lease obligations of our unconsolidated affiliates as of december  these unconsolidated affiliates are limited partnerships  limited liability partnerships or limited liability companies that own operational surgical facilities or surgical facilities that are under development 
none of these affiliates provide financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support for us 
they also do not engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services with us 
moreover  we do not believe that they expose us to any of their liabilities that are not otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we are not obligated to fund losses or otherwise provide additional funding to these affiliates other than as we determine to be economically required in order to successfully implement our development plans 
currently  uspi and its affiliates have three surgery centers and three private surgical hospitals under construction and nine additional surgery centers in the planning stage in the united states 
costs to develop a short stay surgical facility  which include construction  equipment and initial operating losses  vary depending on the range of specialties that will be undertaken at the facility 
our affiliates have budgeted an average of million for development costs for each of the three surgery center projects and approximately million for each of the three surgical hospital projects 
development costs are typically funded with approximately debt at the entity level with the remainder provided as equity from the owners of the entity 
we have made substantially all of the equity contributions to which we are obligated for these projects  but we may choose to invest additional funds in these or other projects in additionally  as each of these facilities becomes operational  each will have obligations associated with debt and capital lease arrangements 
our acquisition and development program will require substantial capital resources  which we estimate to range from million to million per year over the next three years 
these activities primarily include the development of new facilities  buyups of additional ownership in facilities we already operate  and acquisitions of additional facilities 
these activities also include  in some cases  payments of additional purchase price to the sellers of acquired facilities based upon the resolution of certain contingencies or based upon acquired facilities achieving certain financial targets 
we currently estimate that we will pay approximately million under these arrangements  primarily as a result of the resolution of certain contingencies related to our acquisitions of facilities in marbella  spain and london  england 
in addition  the operations of our existing surgical facilities will require ongoing capital expenditures 
we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facilities  and borrowings under capital lease arrangements at newly developed or acquired facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may require additional debt or equity financing for our acquisitions and development projects 
there are no assurances that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we will be required to curtail our acquisition and development program

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our financing  investing and cash management activities 
historically  we have not held or issued derivative financial instruments other than the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps for portions of our borrowings under credit facilities with commercial lenders as required by the credit agreements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our financing arrangements with commercial lenders are based on a spread over libor or 
table of contents euribor 
at december   million of our total outstanding debt was the senior subordinated notes  which were issued in december at a discount and bear interest at a fixed rate of  million was in other fixed rate instruments and the remaining million was in variable rate instruments 
accordingly  a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of million 
the senior subordinated notes  which represent of our total fixed rate debt at december  are considered to have a fair value  based upon recent trading  of million  which is approximately million higher than the carrying value at december  our international revenues are a significant portion of our total revenues 
we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally  including foreign currency exchange risk  and taxes and regulatory changes 
our international operations operate in a natural hedge to a large extent because all operating expenses and revenues are denominated in local currency 
additionally  our borrowings in the united kingdom are currently denominated in local currency 
historically  the cash flow generated from our operations in spain and the united kingdom have been utilized within each of those countries to finance development and acquisition activity as well as for repayment of debt denominated in local currency 
accordingly  we have not utilized financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
inflation and changing prices have not significantly affected our operating results or the markets in which we perform services
