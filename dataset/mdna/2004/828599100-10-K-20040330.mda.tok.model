item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our operations have continued to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our net revenue 
significant reductions in sales to any of our large customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the level and timing of orders placed by a customer vary due to the customer s attempts to balance its inventory  design modifications  changes in a customer s manufacturing strategy  acquisitions of or consolidations among customers  and variation in demand for a customer s products due to  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
termination of manufacturing relationships or changes  reductions or delays in orders could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  as has occurred in the past 
our results also depend to a substantial extent on the success of our oem customers in marketing their products 
we continue to seek to diversify our customer base to reduce our reliance on our few major customers 
see business strategy and customers under item  business 
the industry segments we serve  and the electronics industry as a whole  are subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
discontinuance or modification of products containing components manufactured by our company could adversely affect our results of operations 
the electronics industry is also subject to economic cycles and has in the past experienced  and is likely in the future to experience  recessionary periods 
a prolonged worldwide recession in the electronics industry  as we have experienced throughout and  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results continued to be adversely impacted by the severe instabilities experienced during the last three years in the telecommunication industry  although we began to see conditions improve in the fourth quarter of we typically do not obtain long term volume purchase contracts from our customers  but rather we work with our customers to anticipate future volumes of orders 
based upon such anticipated future orders  we will make commitments regarding the level of business we want and can accomplish given the current timing of production schedules and the levels of and utilization of facilities and personnel 
occasionally  we purchase raw materials without a customer order or commitment 
customers may cancel  delay or reduce orders  usually without penalty  for a variety of reasons  whether relating to the customer or the industry in general  which orders are already made or anticipated 
any significant cancellations  reductions or order delays could adversely affect our results of operations 
we use electronic data interchange edi with both our customers and our suppliers in our efforts to continuously develop accurate forecasts of customer volume requirements  as well as sharing our future requirements with our suppliers 
we depend on the timely availability of many components 
component shortages could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or increased component prices  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
it is important for us to efficiently manage inventory  proper timing of expenditures and allocations of physical and personnel resources in anticipation of future sales  the evaluation of economic conditions in the electronics industry and the mix of products  whether pcbs  wire harnesses  cables  or turnkey products  for manufacture 
see electronic manufacturing industry and supplies and materials management under item  business and results of operations below 
we must continuously develop improved manufacturing procedures to accommodate our customers needs for increasingly complex products 
to continue to grow and be a successful competitor  we must be able to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost effective and timely basis 
although we believe that our operations utilize the assembly and testing technologies and equipment currently required by our customers  there can be no assurance that our process development efforts will be successful or that the emergence of new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements will not render our technology  equipment or processes obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  to the extent that we determine that new assembly and testing technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive  the acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment are likely to require significant capital investment 
during periods of recession in the electronics industry  as we have experienced in  and  our competitive advantages in the areas of quick turnaround manufacturing and responsive customer service may be of reduced importance to electronic oems  who may become more price sensitive 
our results of operations are also affected by other factors  including price competition  the level and timing of customer orders  fluctuations in material costs due to availability  the overhead efficiencies achieved by management in managing the costs of our operations  our experience in manufacturing a particular product  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased orders  selling  and general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  gross margins and operating income margins have generally improved during periods of high volume and high capacity utilization 
we generally have idle capacity and reduced operating margins during periods of lower volume production 
results of operations the following is a discussion of the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein 
compared to consolidated revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
the acquisition of ag technologies  inc in july  generated  of increased sales 
improvements in the computer peripherals and telecommunication industries provided an increase in sales of  in over soft demand in the food preparation industry decreased sales by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest and other income increased approximately  primarily due to the gain on the disposition of a building in scotland in the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
approximately of our consolidated sales for were made to five customers 
illinois tool works itw is the only customer that accounts for more than of our total sales 
the loss of or substantial reduction of sales to any major customer would have an adverse effect on our operations if such sales were not replaced 
see item  business customers 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales amounted to for the year ended december   and for the preceding year 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales was attributable to the different mix of business at our matamoros  mexico facility 
at the remaining four manufacturing locations  cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained the same at for the years ended december  and selling  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  and amounted to approximately of sales for and  respectively 
the increase in was due primarily to the cost added with the acquisition of simclar mexico in july we recorded a one time charge of approximately  in related to the write off of the accumulated foreign currency transaction account due to the substantial liquidation of our wholly owned subsidiary  techdyne europe  in the fourth quarter of interest expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  reflecting the decreased borrowings due to our profitable operations  along with declining interest rates during the year 
the libor three month interest rate was and at december  and  respectively 
compared to consolidated revenues decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
there was a decrease in domestic sales of   and a decrease in european sales of  compared to the preceding year 
the european sales decline in compared to was due to the cessation of operations in europe on february   see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the domestic sales decline was primarily because of a continuation of the decrease in our shipments to our customers in the telecommunications industry during the first half of domestic sales increased by approximately  during the second half of  compared to the second half of interest and other income decreased by approximately  compared to the preceding year 
this decrease reflects the recognition of a  deferred gain on sale of a buildings to medicore in and reduction of approximately  in interest income from stock option notes receivable see note to our consolidated financial statements 
approximately of our consolidated sales for were made to five customers 
illinois tool works itw is the only customer that accounts for more than of our total sales

cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales amounted to for the year ended december   and for the preceding year 
we experienced favorable operating cost reductions of approximately  as a result of closing the techdyne europe manufacturing facility in may as compared to our previous year s operating costs 
the reorganization of three manufacturing facilities during the second half of provided reduced operating costs of approximately  for the year ended december  lower component costs during the second half of added additional savings to the improvement of our gross margins for as compared to selling  general and administrative expenses  although decreasing by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year  amounted to approximately of sales for and of sales for the decrease in was due primarily to the reduction in the costs of support personnel and marketing personnel implemented during the third and fourth quarters of  and to the closing of the techdyne europe manufacturing facilities in may we recorded a one time charge of  in related to the forgiveness of stock option notes and related accrued interest see item  recent developments as well as bonuses for certain officers and directors  all as a result of the sale of the company to simclar group in june interest expense decreased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year reflecting the decreased borrowings due to our profitable operations and to the reductions in inventories  along with declining interest rates during the year 
the three month libor was and at december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balances at december  were approximately  compared to approximately  at december  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately  in compared to approximately  in the decrease in cash provided from operating activities in as compared to was due primarily to a decrease in net income and an increase in inventories 
the reduction in net income resulted from higher income tax provision and the write off of the accumulated foreign currency translation account in the period ended december   compared to the preceding year 
the increase in inventories was due to the increase in sales at the hialeah and north attleboro facilities 
at december   our average days sales outstanding was days as compared to days at december  the increase of our average days sales outstanding is primarily the result of a increase in our sales to the telecommunications industry in  compared to average inventory turnover was and times for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in inventory turnover is primarily due to slowdown in sales to our food preparation equipment customers during as compared to cash flows used in investing activities decreased approximately  in to  as compared to approximately  in cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisition of simclar mexico  less the proceeds from the settlement of the insurance claim from the fire loss of the building in scotland and proceeds from the sale of land in scotland 
we have a capital expenditure budget of  for cash flow used in financing activities was approximately  in as compared to cash flow used in of approximately  the cash flow was used to reduce our long term loan from the bank of scotland 
on october   we entered into two credit facilities with bank of scotland in edinburgh  scotland for an aggregate borrowing of  this financing replaced the lines of credit and three commercial loans with the provident bank of ohio 
the financing included a  line of credit with an interest rate at libor rate plus for a one  three or six month period  at our election  and which expires september  we elected the three month interest rate period at until january  after this date the rate is until april  this line of credit had an outstanding balance of  at december  the bank of scotland financing also included a seven year term loan of  at the same interest rate as the line of credit 
the term loan specifies quarterly payments of  due in january  april  july and october of each year  plus interest 
the term loan had an outstanding balance of  at december  all of the assets of simclar  except for the assets of techdyne europe and simclar mexico  collateralize the credit facilities 
the credit facilities require affirmative and negative covenants 
certain of the affirmative covenants require maintenance of a consolidated adjusted net worth greater than  ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated net borrowing not less than to  a ratio of consolidated trade receivables to consolidated net borrowings not less than 
to  and a ratio of consolidated net income before interest and income taxes to total consolidated interest costs not less than to some of the negative covenants  among others include granting or permitting a security agreement against the consolidated assets of the companies other than permitted security agreements  declaring or paying any dividends or making any other payments on our capital stock  consolidating or merging with any other entity or acquiring or purchasing any equity interest in any other entity  or assuming any obligations of any other entity  except for notes and receivables acquired in the ordinary course of business  incurring  assuming  guarantying  or remaining liable with respect to any indebtedness  except for certain existing indebtedness disclosed in our financial statements  or undertaking any capital expenditure in excess of  in any one fiscal year 
the agreements also preclude changes in ownership in the companies  any material change in any of our business objectives  purposes  operations and tax residence or any other circumstances or events which will have a material adverse effect as defined by the agreements 
our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by changes in our business condition or results of our operations  or other events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our debt 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the bank s financial covenants 
management believes we will continue to be in compliance with our covenants in a default of the covenants would permit our lender to accelerate the maturity of our credit facilities and to sell the assets securing them  which would cause us to cease operations and seek bankruptcy protection 
on october   techdyne europe entered into a credit facility with bank of scotland for an amount of pound  
this facility comprised an eight year term loan repayable in quarterly payments of pound   due in january  april  july and october of each year  with an interest rate of bank of scotland base rate plus effectively at december  
this term loan in the amount of pound   was paid off on september  we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements with related or unrelated parties and no unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual and other commercial commitments that impact or can impact the liquidity of our operations

variable interests may arise from financial instruments  service contracts  minority ownership interests or other arrangements 
if an entity holds a majority of the variable interests  or a significant variable interest that is considerably more than any other party s variable interest  that entity would be the primary beneficiary and would be required to include the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the special purpose entity in its consolidated financial statements 
the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
allowance for inventory obsolescence we maintain an allowance for inventory obsolescence for losses resulting from inventory items becoming unusable in the manufacturing operations due to loss of a specific customer or a customer s product changes or discontinuations 
based on historical and projected sales information and concentration of customers  we believe that the allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could cause customers to cancel  reduce or reschedule orders 
these changes could affect the company inventory turn over  therefore  the allowance for inventory obsolescence is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
income taxes deferred income taxes at the end of each period are determined by applying enacted tax rates applicable to future periods in which the taxes are expected to be paid or recovered to differences between the financial accounting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
when required  impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of these assets is determined based upon estimates of future cash flows  market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if required 
in analyzing the fair value and recoverability using future cash flows  we make projections based on a number of assumptions and estimates of growth rates  future economic conditions  assignment of discount rates and estimates of terminal values 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
the measurement of impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
see long lived asset impairment in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are required to be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using a fair value based test that compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair values are typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows  using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we performed the annual test for goodwill impairment related to the lytton inc acquisition 
these tests were performed at the reporting unit level 
in the test  we determined that the discounted sum of the expected future cash flows from the assets exceeded the carrying value of those assets  therefore  no impairment of goodwill was recognized 
in performing the tests for impairment  we made assumptions about future sales and profitability 
in estimating expected future cash flows related to the lytton inc assets  we used internal forecasts that were based upon actual results  assuming an average revenue growth of per year and minimal increases in gross margin 
at the time of the impairment test  the carrying value of net assets for lytton inc was  if our estimate of expected future cash flows had been lower  the expected future cash flows would still have exceeded the carrying value of the assets by  including goodwill 
the most critical estimates  in order of significance  used in the impairment test include estimated revenue growths  the terminal value assumed  and the discount rate applied 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on lytton s reported asset values 
such events may include strategic decisions made in response to economic conditions relative to operations and the impact of technology  economic conditions  and industry trends on our customer base 
revenue recognition our sales are primarily derived from product manufacturing including  but not limited to  finished molded and non molded cables  wiring harnesses  printed circuit board assemblies  electro mechanical and electronic assemblies 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer  under contractual terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
upon shipment  title transfers and the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
the selling price of the product is fixed and the ability to collect for the sale to the customer is reasonably assured when the product is shipped 
revenue from contract manufacturing  rework and refurbishing is recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer  under contractual terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired business to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
we used outside sources of information to complete a valuation to assist in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the acquisition of ag technologies  inc completed during such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially related to intangible assets 
the purchased intangible assets were recorded by us for the acquisition at the fair value assigned 
critical estimates were used in valuing certain intangible assets and plant and equipment include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired customers continuing sales  and the expected useful life of plant and equipment 
our estimates are based upon assumptions we believe are reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements this report includes certain forward looking statements with respect to our company and our business that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements are influenced by our financial position  business strategy  budgets  projected costs and the plans and objectives of management for future operations 
they use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  intend  project and other similar expressions 
although we believe our expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  we cannot assure you that our expectations will prove correct 
actual results and developments may differ materially from those conveyed in the forward looking statements 
for these statements  we claim the protections for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of important factors include changes in general economic  business and market conditions  as well as changes in such conditions that may affect industries or the markets in which we operate  including  in particular  the impact of our nation s current war on terrorism could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements made in this report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in short term government securities and interest bearing accounts at financial institutions in which we had approximately  invested at december  interest rate risks on debt are managed by negotiation of appropriate rates on new financing obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt agreements which totaled approximately  at december  we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
a decrease in rates on our year end investments would have an insignificant impact on our results of operations 
a increase in rates on our year end variable rate debt would result in a negative impact of approximately  on our operations 
our exposure to market risks from foreign currency exchange rates is minimal due to the closing of techdyne europe in may and our transfer of all techdyne europe operating assets to simclar group in february
