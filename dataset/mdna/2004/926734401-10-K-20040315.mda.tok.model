highlights operating results following a significant decline in revenue in  we stabilized our total revenue in however  deferred revenue declined significantly 
this was due  in part  to the weak macroeconomic conditions and  in particular  the slowed pace of investment in information technology generally and the application software industry specifically 
contributions from our international businesses declined from of revenue in and represented approximately of total revenue in no customer accounted for more than our revenues 
throughout  we continued our cost control efforts and saw a significant decline in operating expenses 
a substantial portion of the decline in operating expenses was driven by reduced impairment charges  changes to our real estate restructuring assumptions and reductions in our headcount related costs 
during the fourth quarter of  we reevaluated our office space portfolio and decided to vacate our austin  texas  headquarters to relocate to nearby office space that we had previously identified as restructuring space 
this relocation decision resulted in a net benefit in the fourth quarter of million based on the application of eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we also changed certain other restructuring assumptions related to real estate  which yielded an additional benefit of

index to financial statements  in addition  we incurred restructuring expenses of million 
taken together  these activities caused us to record a net restructuring benefit of million during the quarter 
in the first quarter of  we moved out of our existing headquarters and relocated to the nearby office space that now serves as our headquarters 
as such  we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
our headcount was as of december   down from  at december   but remained relatively stable over the last three quarters of following the completion of integration activities related to the tower technology acquisition on march   we expect our total headcount to be approximately finally  our total cash and short term investments balance totaled approximately million as of december   and decreased approximately million from december   primarily due to acquisition related payments  payments under lease obligations and overall net losses incurred 
acquisitions we have strengthened our product portfolio through acquisitions to increase our competitive differentiation as an enterprise web solution provider 
we acquired intraspect software  inc  a leading provider of enterprise collaboration solutions in late  and we acquired tower technology pty limited  a leading enterprise document and records management  imaging and workflow vendor in early on december   we completed the acquisition of privately held intraspect software  inc  a leading provider of enterprise collaboration solutions 
with the acquisition of intraspect  we are able to offer a java based suite of technologies that includes portal  web content management and collaboration functionality 
the consideration paid for intraspect was comprised of million in cash and approximately million shares of vignette stock 
on march   we completed the acquisition of privately held tower technology pty limited  a leading enterprise document and records management  imaging and workflow vendor 
with the completion of the tower technology acquisition  we are able to offer enterprise content management capabilities for managing high volumes of documents  online transactions and records  in combination with our portal  web content management and collaboration technologies 
the consideration paid to the tower technology stockholders was comprised of approximately million in cash and approximately million shares of our stock 
with the completion of these two acquisitions  we are in a unique position to provide an integrated suite of technology that enables our customers to capture  manage and deliver information on an enterprise wide basis 
outlook our objective is to maintain and extend our leadership position as a global provider of applications and products that enable organizations to harness the power of information and the web to deliver measurable improvements in business efficiency 
we will focus on delivering sustained revenue growth  expanding our customer base of global organizations both at the enterprise and departmental levels  extending our technology and product leadership through internal investment in research and development  expanding our global sales capabilities and extending our partnership alliances with leading technology and services companies 
our strategy from an execution and distribution perspective is to change our selling approach and messaging 
specifically  we will increasingly focus on business problems and their corresponding solutions 
we will address specific business imperatives  such as compliance  self service  employee productivity  partner and supplier collaboration  demand generation and expense reduction through areas such as site consolidation and the elimination of labor based paper processing 
we will also focus on the indirect channel  particularly opportunities to expand our oem business  and continue our commitment to customer service 
we believe these efforts  combined with the new breadth of our solutions  will better position us to meet and exceed customer demands for an integrated set of best of breed applications and capture market share

index to financial statements the primary risk to achieving our goals is competitive pressure  particularly from larger companies with much longer operating histories and greater resources 
moreover  many of these companies can adopt aggressive pricing policies and provide customers with consolidated offerings that may include some of our product capabilities 
other key risks include market acceptance of our products  successful integration of the intraspect and tower technology acquisitions  the overall level of information technology spending and our ability to maintain control over expenses and cash 
our prospects must be considered in light of these risks  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties

option exchange offer on february   we offered eligible employees the right to exchange certain outstanding stock options for new ones 
the decline in the market value of our common stock since has resulted in a stock price that is substantially below the strike price of many employee stock options granted during the past several years 
this voluntary exchange program was designed to retain our employees and provide them with a long term incentive to maximize stockholder value 
the offer period is expected to end on march  the exercise price of new options to be granted will depend on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date which will be at least six months and one day from the cancellation date and the total number of options issued will range from to of the total options canceled based on a pre determined formula 
the program has been organized to comply with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  and is not expected to result in any additional compensation charges or variable plan accounting 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed with and agreed upon the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long term investments  estimating business restructuring accruals  and valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
revenue recognition revenue consists of product and service fees 
product fee income is earned through the licensing or right to use our software and from the sale of specific software products 
service fee income is earned through the sale of maintenance and technical support  consulting services and training services 
we do not recognize revenue for agreements with rights of return  refundable fees  cancellation rights or acceptance clauses until such rights to return  refund or cancel have expired or acceptance has occurred 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements as revised by sab where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements specific to us 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
revenue allocated to product license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  we have no significant remaining obligations with regard to implementation  and collection of a fixed or determinable fee is probable 
we consider all payments outside our normal payment terms  including all amounts due in excess of one year  to not be fixed and determinable  and such amounts are recognized as revenue as they become due 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
for software arrangements where we are obligated to perform professional services for implementation  we do not consider delivery to have occurred or customer payment to be probable of collection until no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain 
generally  this would occur when substantially all service work has been completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the customer s implementation requirements but may vary depending on factors such as an individual customer s payment history or order type eg  initial versus follow on 
revenue from perpetual licenses that include unspecified  additional software products is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  beginning with the delivery of the first product 
revenue allocated to maintenance and support is recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenue allocated to training and consulting service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of our products as i such services are available from other vendors and ii we have sufficient experience in providing such services 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers in excess of revenue recognized 
accounts receivable includes amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
for example  in determining whether collection is probable  we assess our customers ability and intent to pay 
our actual experience with respect to collections could differ from our initial assessment if  for instance  unforeseen declines in the overall economy occur and negatively impact our customers financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously assess the collectibility of outstanding customer invoices and in doing such  we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the non collection of customer receivables 
in estimating this allowance  we consider factors such as historical collection experience  a customer s current credit worthiness  customer concentrations  age of the receivable balance  both individually and in the aggregate  and general economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
for example  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents 
index to financial statements long term investments long term investments include investments in equity securities of both private and public companies and restricted certificates of deposit with original maturities in excess of one year 
long term investments are recorded at their estimated fair value 
we periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments considered other than temporary 
in performing this analysis  we evaluate whether general market conditions which reflect prospects for the economy as a whole  or information pertaining to an investment s industry or that individual company  indicates that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
if so  we consider specific factors  including the financial condition and near term prospects of each investment  any event that may affect the investee company  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we record an investment impairment charge in the line item other income expense  net when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
business restructuring we vacated excess leased facilities as a result of the restructuring plan we initiated in and subsequently expanded in we recorded an accrual for the remaining lease liabilities of such vacated properties as well as brokerage commissions  partially offset by estimated sublease income 
we estimated the costs of these excess leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and sublease income  based on market information and trend analysis 
we continually assess our real estate portfolio and may vacate or occupy other leased space as dictated by our analysis 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate our accrual for facility lease commitments 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement on january  in accordance with statement  we replaced the ratable amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets with a periodic review and analysis for possible impairment 
we were required to perform a transitional impairment review which involved a two step process step involves identifying reporting units  determining the fair value of each reporting unit  and determining if the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if necessary  step is to be completed before the end of the year in which the company adopts the statement 
step measures the impairment charge and is completed if the fair value is less than the carrying value  as determined in step the completion of this impairment review required management to make complex estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to determining our reporting unit s  selecting the appropriate methodology to determine the estimated fair value of a reporting unit as well as the actual fair value estimation of each reporting unit 
if our estimates or assumptions were to change  this could result in a materially different impairment conclusion 
we performed the required transitional impairment test of goodwill during the first quarter of and determined that we did not have a transitional impairment of goodwill 
subsequent to the transitional impairment test  we must assess goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we assess our goodwill on october of each year and during an interim period if facts or circumstances would more likely than not suggest that the fair value of an identified reporting unit is below its carrying value 
such periodic assessment of goodwill resulted in a significant goodwill impairment charge during the quarter ended december  there was no impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets in accounting reclassification and change in accounting estimate effective december   we report all bad debt expense in the operating expense cost category  sales and marketing 
prior to december   we reported a portion of bad debt expense in cost of revenue services

cost of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense  and research and development expense were estimated as a percent of revenue based on each acquired company s historical results and industry averages 
the cost to complete the in process products was removed from the research and development expense 
these estimated operating expenses as well as capital charges and applicable income taxes were deducted to arrive at an estimated after tax cash flow

such discount rates were based on each acquired company s weighted average cost of capital of and  respectively  as adjusted upwards for the additional risk related to the projects development and success

the timing for the completion of such efforts was expected to range between twelve and eighteen months 
further  we were uncertain of our ability to complete the products within a timeframe acceptable to the market and ahead of competitors 
impairment of intangible assets 
impairment of intangible assets decreased and in and  respectively 
these fluctuations relate primarily to the impairment of goodwill in and there was no impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets in we assess our goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
we completed the annual assessment of goodwill using the two step approach  pursuant to statement  and as a result recorded a million charge 
the impairment was recorded in light of sustained negative industry and economic trends impacting current operations  the significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
the impaired goodwill was originally recorded in connection with the four business combinations effected during and such acquisitions were completed during a period when stock valuations for software companies were generally at much higher levels 
the value determined in step of the assessment  which involves comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit  indicated a goodwill impairment 
we estimated fair value based on market capitalization  as complemented by a discounted cash flow analysis 
we measured the impairment loss by completing step during the fourth quarter of step involved determining the enterprise s implied fair value of goodwill 
the carrying amount of our goodwill was greater than the implied fair value of goodwill  resulting in full impairment of the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with our and business combinations 
also in  the datasage  inc trademark was impaired due to changes in product offerings 
such changes altered the packaging and marketing of certain technology and therefore rendered the related trademark obsolete  resulting in a million impairment charge 
prior to the adoption of statement in  we evaluated enterprise level goodwill pursuant to apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  and recorded an impairment charge in the impairment was recorded in light of significant negative industry and economic trends impacting our operations  the significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time and our market capitalization relative to our net book value 
the overall decline in industry and economic growth rates indicated that this trend may continue for an indefinite period 
using a discounted cash flow approach  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge in the quarter ended december  to reduce enterprise level goodwill to its estimated fair value 
goodwill was originally recorded in connection with our four business acquisitions completed during fiscal years and such acquisitions were generally completed during a period when stock valuations for companies in the software sector were at a much higher level 
the estimate of fair value was based upon the discounted estimated cash flows using a discount rate of and an estimated terminal growth rate of 
the discount rate was based upon our risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital 
the assumptions supporting the estimated cash flows  including the discount rate and estimated

it is reasonably possible that the estimates and assumptions used may change 
we review goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment periodically 
sustained negative industry and economic trends  a decline in our stock price and market capitalization for an extended period of time  or changes in our product offerings could result in future impairment charges that are material to our consolidated financial statements 
business restructuring charges 
in  we initiated a restructuring program to align our expense and revenue levels and to better position us for growth and profitability 
in and  we expanded those restructuring efforts 
although we have substantially implemented our restructuring activities  there can be no assurance that the estimated costs of our restructuring efforts will not change 
components of business restructuring charges and the remaining restructuring accruals as of december  are as follows in thousands facility lease commitments asset impairments employee separation and other costs total balance at december  total restructuring charge cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity non cash activity balance at december  effect of expanded restructuring plan adjustment to accrual cash activity balance at december  less current portion accrued restructuring costs  less current portion during we adjusted our existing restructuring accruals  resulting in net a restructuring gain of million 
a substantial portion of this income was primarily driven by non recurring charges related to changes in real estate restructuring assumptions 
specifically  during the fourth quarter we reevaluated our office space portfolio and decided to vacate our austin  texas  headquarters to relocate to nearby office space that we had previously identified as restructuring space 
this relocation resulted in a net benefit of approximately million in the fourth quarter of we also increased our estimates regarding sublease income 
in the first quarter of  we moved out of our existing headquarters and relocated to our new one and  as such  we expect to record a restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of including the aforementioned million charge  remaining cash expenditures resulting from the restructuring are estimated to be million and relate primarily to facility lease commitments  of which the remaining maximum lease commitment is eight years 
we have substantially implemented our restructuring efforts initiated in conjunction with this restructuring plan  however  there can be no assurance that the estimated costs of our restructuring efforts will not change 

table of contents 
index to financial statements facility lease commitments relate to lease obligations for excess office space that we have vacated as a result of the restructuring plan 
total lease commitments include the remaining lease liabilities and brokerage commissions  offset by estimated sublease income 
the estimated costs of vacating these leased facilities  including estimated costs to sublease and any resulting sublease income  were based on market information and trend analysis 
we continually assess our estimates of our real estate portfolio and may vacate and or occupy other leased space as dictated by its analysis 
it is reasonably possible that actual results could continue to differ from these estimates in the near term  and such differences could be material to the financial statements 
in particular  actual sublease income attributable to the consolidation of excess facilities might deviate from the assumptions used to calculate our accrual for facility lease commitments 
facility lease commitments relate to our departure from certain office space in austin and houston  texas  redwood city  los angeles and san ramon  california  boston  waltham  reading and cambridge  massachusetts  new york  new york  maidenhead  united kingdom  paris  france  hamburg  germany  madrid  spain  sydney and melbourne  australia  bangalore and guragon  india  hong kong  china  and singapore 
the maximum lease commitment of such vacated properties is eight years from december  asset impairments relate to the impairment of certain fixed assets  prepaid royalties and intangible assets 
these fixed assets were impaired as a result of our decision to vacate certain office space and align its infrastructure with current and projected headcount 
employee separation and other costs include severance  related taxes  outplacement and other restructuring charges 
as a result of the restructuring activities  we have severed approximately  employees during the past three years 
employee groups impacted by the restructuring efforts include personnel in positions throughout the sales  marketing  professional services  engineering and general and administrative functions in all geographies 
during  we favorably resolved certain employee matters that related to our reduction in force 
this resolution resulted in a million decrease in the employee separation and other costs accrual 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
for stock options issued to employees  we record deferred compensation at the grant date if a difference exists between the exercise price and the market value of our common stock 
for restricted share issuances  we record deferred compensation equal to the market value on the issue date 
for the stock options we assumed in connection with our acquisition of ondisplay  inc in july  we have recorded deferred compensation for the difference between the exercise price of the unvested stock options and the fair value of our common stock at the acquisition date 
deferred stock compensation is amortized on an accelerated basis over the vesting periods of the applicable options and restricted share grants 
amortization of deferred stock compensation is attributable to the following cost categories in thousands year ended december  cost of revenue services research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets 
intangible amortization expense decreased and in and  respectively 
in  the decrease relates to our adoption of statement for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  statement requires that ratable amortization be replaced with periodic review and analysis for possible impairment 
an intangible asset with a definite life must continue to be amortized over its estimated useful life 
the decrease in relates to a change in the estimated useful life of technologies purchased as part of the ondisplay  inc acquisition 
due to changes in our product architecture and anticipated future product offerings  the estimated life of this acquired technology was reduced from four years to two years 
such technology was fully amortized at june

index to financial statements other income and expense other income and expense  net consists primarily of interest income and expense  recognized investment gains and losses as well as foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
year ended december  compared to compared to other income expense  net other income and expense improved in and primarily due to the impairment of certain long term investments in and  as partially offset by decreasing yields on lower cash and short term investment balances 
the impaired long term investments generally consist of redeemable convertible preferred stock in privately held technology companies as well as common stock in publicly held technology companies 
we periodically analyze our long term investments for impairments that are considered other than temporary 
as a result  we recognized impairment charges of  million and million in  and  respectively 
at december   our unrestricted  long term investments totaled million 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of an investee could require future impairment charges 
provision for income taxes income tax expense consists primarily of estimated withholdings and income taxes due in certain foreign jurisdictions 
year ended december  compared to compared to provision for income taxes we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which includes net operating loss  capital loss and research tax credit carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
quarterly results the table on pages f to f of the consolidated financial statements section sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of operations data  both in absolute dollars and as a percent of revenue  for each of the last consecutive eight quarters 
as a result of our limited operating history  we cannot forecast operating expenses based on historical results 
accordingly  we base our forecast for expenses in part on future revenue projections 
many of these expenses are fixed in the short term  and we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if revenues are lower than we have projected 
our ability to accurately forecast our quarterly revenue is limited due to the long sales cycle of our software products  which makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which product implementation will occur  and the variability of customer demand for professional services 
we would expect our business  operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected if revenues do not meet projections and that net losses in a given quarter would be even greater than expected

index to financial statements our operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect our operating results will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
a number of factors are likely to cause these variations  including demand for our products and services  the timing of sales of our products and services  the timing of customer orders and product implementations  seasonal fluctuations in information technology purchasing  unexpected delays in introducing new products and services  increased expenses  whether related to sales and marketing  product development or administration  changes in the rapidly evolving market for web based applications  the mix of product license and services revenue  as well as the mix of products licensed  the mix of services provided and whether services are provided by our own staff or third party contractors  the mix of domestic and international sales  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  costs related to possible acquisitions of technology or businesses  global events  including terrorist activities and military operations  the general economic climate  and changes to our licensing and pricing model 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful 
investors should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of december   we had federal net operating losses carried forward  research and development carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  and million  respectively 
the net operating loss  credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards will expire at various dates  between and  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses  tax credits  and capital loss carryforwards in the event of an ownership change of a corporation 
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of million at december  were incurred by businesses we acquired and will be subject to annual limitation 
these restrictions may severely limit the benefit of these tax attributes in future periods 
in addition  the remaining net operating loss of million and tax credit carryover million may be subject to this limitation 
these restrictions may severely limit the benefit of these tax attributes in future periods 
as a result  substantial amounts of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may expire prior to utilization 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets  which include net operating losses carried forward  and research and development carryforwards  and capital loss carryforwards because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   the valuation allowance includes approximately million related to the acquisition of epicentric  inc  and intraspect software  inc net deferred tax assets 
the initial recognition of these acquired deferred tax asset items will first reduce goodwill  then other non current intangible assets of the acquired entity 
approximately million of the valuation allowance relates to tax benefits for stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward  substantially all of which  when realized  will be allocated directly to contributed capital to the extent the benefits exceed amounts attributable to compensation expense

interest rate risk cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that we do not have material interest risk exposure
