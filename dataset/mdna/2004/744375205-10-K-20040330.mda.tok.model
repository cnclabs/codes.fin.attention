critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this form k 
management believes the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition the company is in the business of performing drug testing and reporting the results thereof 
the company performs drug testing which includes training for collection of samples and storage of positive samples for its customers for an agreed upon fee per unit tested of samples 
the revenues are recognized when the predominant deliverable  drug testing  is provided and reported to the customer 
the company also provides expert testimony  when and if necessary  to support the test results  which is generally billed separately and recognized as the services are provided 
in  the company adopted emerging issue task force  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which was effective for all transactions entered into subsequent to june  the company applied the consensus reached under eitf and concluded that the testing  training and storage elements are considered one unit of accounting for revenue recognition purposes as the training and storage costs do not have stand alone value to the customer 
the company has concluded that the predominant deliverable in the arrangement is the testing of the units and has recognized revenue as that service is performed and reported to the customer 
deferred revenue represents payments received in advance of the performance of drug testing procedures 
deferred revenue is reclassified as revenue when the underlying test results are delivered 
with respect to a portion of these transactions  there may be instances where the customer ultimately does not require performance referred to as breakage 
revenue is then recognized as other income when the company can reasonably  reliably and objectively determine the breakage has occurred 
breakage is deemed to occur only at the point it becomes remote that performance will be required 
the company has not recorded any breakage in  and the company continues to monitor this to determine whether breakage can be reasonably  reliably and objectively determined 

table of contents estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  including bad debts and income taxes  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period

deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
a deferred tax valuation allowance is required if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized
