the international segment distributes most of our athletic  outdoor and activewear products 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  and capital resources are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  long lived assets  deferred income taxes  restructuring reserves  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that some of our significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues  net of estimated sales returns  discounts and allowances  when goods are shipped  title has passed  the sales price is fixed  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
substantially all of our sales reflect fob free on board shipping point terms 
ii 
table of contents we record provisions for estimated sales returns and allowances on sales in the same period as the related sales are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analyses of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  net sales could either be understated or overstated 
trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable consist of amounts due from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect expected credit losses 
we provide for bad debts based on collection history and specific risks identified on a customer by customer basis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of accounts receivable and the creditworthiness of each customer 
furthermore  these judgments must be continually evaluated and updated 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate causing an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for bad debts may be required in future periods 
on the other hand  if our ultimate recovery on the accounts we have reserved or written off exceeds our estimates  we may need to decrease our reserves in the future 
for example  we increased our reserve in the third quarter of fiscal to reflect estimated losses related to kmart corporation kmart  which filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws in january in  we sold our kmart pre petition receivables  and thus  we are no longer exposed to further credit losses on kmart pre petition receivables 
inventories 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost for a substantial portion of inventories determined under the last in  first out lifo method 
we write down obsolete and unmarketable inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon  among other things  assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we apply the lower of cost or market principle to lifo inventories in the aggregate  rather than to individual stock keeping units sku s  because it is not practical to establish the lifo cost of an individual sku 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in  our pre tax income was favorably impacted by million from the liquidation in one of our lifo pools that had inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with current costs 
in  we recorded a lifo charge of million due to lower inventory levels  of which million related to the liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at higher costs prevailing in prior years as compared with our current manufacturing costs 
deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is likely to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would make an adjustment to increase our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and that adjustment would be charged to income in the period that we make the determination 
likewise  if we determine that we will be able to realize more of our deferred tax assets than we currently expect  we would adjust our deferred tax assets  which would have the effect of increasing income in the period that we make the determination 
we recorded million  million and million of valuation allowances related to net deferred tax assets primarily foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards in fiscal  and  respectively 
at the end of fiscal  our total valuation allowances amounted to million 
impairment and depreciation of property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the lives of the assets 
we estimate the depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment based on the period over which the assets will be of economic benefit to us 
in  we completed the implementation of our new fixed asset system  which resulted in the retirement of approximately million of assets primarily machinery and equipment that were primarily fully depreciated and no longer in use 
we review property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
most of our property  plant and equipment are employed in integrated manufacturing and distribution processes 
accordingly  we ordinarily cannot assess impairment of assets held for use at the individual asset level  but rather we aggregate them into logical groups for purposes of testing whether they are impaired 
when we identify assets that will be taken out of service through the ordinary course of replacement and modernization or through restructuring activities  we shorten the remaining useful lives and adjust the salvage values  as appropriate  to recognize depreciation over the shortened remaining estimated useful lives 
otherwise  we classify assets as held for sale  write down the carrying value to fair value less cost to sell and suspend depreciation on the assets when we formulate a plan of disposal and there is no operational requirement to continue their use 
we determine fair value  in most cases  by reference to third party appraisals  and  in other cases  we perform internal analyses based upon recent sales prices of comparable assets when available 
we periodically evaluate the carrying values of assets held for sale to determine whether revisions are needed to reflect changed circumstances  including market conditions 
ii 
table of contents in  we recorded million  net of million of realized gains on the disposal of five properties  of asset impairment charges on assets previously held for sale and an asset that we abandoned 
at january   we had six idled properties remaining to be sold  which are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at approximately million  representing our best estimates of ultimate selling prices less disposal costs 
although we do not anticipate further significant charges  the actual proceeds from the sales of these facilities and the actual costs to dispose of these assets may differ from our current estimates  which would require us to recognize a non operating charge or credit to future earnings 
impairment and amortization of intangible assets 
under fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  amortization of goodwill is eliminated  however  an annual two step impairment test is required 
the first step determines if goodwill is impaired by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole to the book value 
if a deficiency exists  the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss as the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value 
in performing these annual impairment tests  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the carrying values are impaired  and then  if impaired  to determine the amount of any impairment loss required to reduce the carrying value to fair value 
if these estimates or assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
purchased intangibles with indefinite economic lives are tested for impairment annually using a lower of cost or fair value approach 
in determining whether an intangible has an indefinite life  we consider the expected use of the asset  the expected useful lives of other assets to which the asset may relate  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions  the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset  and the effects of obsolescence  demand and other economic factors 
in performing these annual impairment tests  we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the carrying values are impaired  and then  if impaired  to determine the amount of any impairment loss required to reduce the carrying value to fair value 
if these estimates or assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
other intangibles continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years  and reviewed for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate property  plant and equipment 
pension benefits 
we account for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires us to recognize pension costs and liabilities based on actuarial evaluations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including the discount rate at which the pension obligations could be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of future salary increases  and the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we consider current yields on high quality fixed income investments 
the salary increase assumption is based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the historical rate of return on the invested funds of the pension plan after adjusting for current market trends 
periodic changes in these key assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount of recorded pension liabilities and on future pension benefit costs  although sfas no 
permits the effects of the performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension assumptions on our computation of pension expense to be amortized over future periods 
for instance  given the continued decrease in interest rates  we plan to reduce the discount rate from in to in in addition  we plan to change the salary increase assumption from in to in these assumption changes along with changes in the plan participants demographics and other factors are expected to increase pension expense by million from fiscal to fiscal although our actual return on pension plan assets improved in  an after tax minimum pension liability of approximately million remained in stockholders equity at january  restructuring and other unusual charges 
with respect to our operational improvement program announced in october and our multi year restructuring and reorganization program announced in july discussed in more detail below  our consolidated balance sheets reflect our best estimate of the ultimate settlement of severance  exit cost and other accruals 
in  we recorded approximately million in severance and other costs 
in addition  we settled some of our estimated liabilities for more or less than the amounts accrued in prior periods 
at the end of fiscal  we have approximately million in remaining severance  exit cost and other liabilities 
our estimates for these costs could change if the actual costs of termination benefits or other costs are different from our expectations 
stock compensation 
awards under our incentive compensation plans as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements may include incentive stock awards  nonqualified stock options  reload stock options and restricted shares 
on january   we adopted the prospective transition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting and disclosure of stock based compensation  ii 
table of contents as amended by sfas no 
sfas no 
uses a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock awards using assumptions such as a risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected life of the stock award and the expected volatility of our stock price 
by electing the prospective transition method of sfas no 
 our results of operations and our financial position were not affected by stock compensation awards granted prior to january  we recognized approximately million million after tax in stock compensation in for stock compensation awards granted prior to january   we used the intrinsic value approach under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a comparison of reported results versus proforma results that assumes the fair value based method of sfas no 
had been applied to all stock compensation awards granted 
operational improvement program in october  we announced an operational improvement program targeting million in cost reductions to offset anticipated selling price decreases  higher fiber costs and other cost increases for fiscal the operational improvement program includes improving operating efficiencies and asset utilization  while streamlining processes in both our manufacturing and administrative areas such as expanded production with lower cost contractors in central america  lower sourcing costs  increased efficiencies in domestic textile operations  and improved distribution costs 
as part of the operational improvement program  we eliminated approximately positions in  primarily salaried and administrative office staff  and incurred asset impairment charges associated with the planned closings of two international sales offices and the abandonment of a previously idled domestic finished goods warehouse 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the charges associated with the operational improvement program 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in remaining liabilities  which we expect will be substantially paid in fiscal in addition  we have started construction on a new textile plant in honduras for both t shirt and fleece production 
once fully operational in  the annual savings from phase i of the merendon plant are expected to be approximately million to million 
multi year restructuring and reorganization program in july  we adopted a restructuring and reorganization program with the objective of transitioning our company from a manufacturing driven business to a consumer focused organization that markets branded apparel products  and creating an efficient  low cost operating structure with the flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities to reduce our costs 
the plan originally called for closing a number of our worldwide facilities which included selected manufacturing plants  distribution centers and offices  expanding production outside the united states  consolidating and downsizing the licensed products businesses  disposing of owned shopping center real estate  reorganizing the corporate structure  and other cost savings initiatives 
in addition  we established a dual headquarters in atlanta  georgia 
in july  we announced an extension of this program to align the organization by distribution channel to provide stronger customer service  supply chain management  and more cost effective operations 
as a result of our restructuring and reorganization program of our yarn requirements are now purchased  rather than manufactured internally  from frontier yarns  llc frontier yarns  our owned yarn joint venture  frontier spinning mills  inc frontier spinning  our joint venture partner  and other third party suppliers  we reduced our us employee base by approximately from  in to  at the end of  we have outsourced production of approximately of our finished fabrics for our domestic business  and over of our apparel products excluding socks sold are now sewn and assembled offshore  compared to approximately in we also closed facilities and exited unprofitable businesses and product lines representing approximately million of sales as measured by the last full year of operations for each business 
the cost savings associated with these initiatives were the primary drivers in maintaining gross margin levels in fiscal years through despite pricing pressures in certain of our channels primarily artwear careerwear and other factors discussed in the results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the restructuring  reorganization and other unusual charges associated with the multi year restructuring and reorganization program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in our annual report for details of the  and charges associated with the multi year restructuring and reorganization program 
at the end of fiscal  we had million in remaining restructuring liabilities under this program  which we expect will be substantially paid in fiscal although the majority of the facilities idled by our restructuring initiatives have been sold  we have six idle properties remaining to sell  which are reflected in our balance sheet at million 
this value represents our best estimate of future selling prices less disposal costs 
we expect most  if not all  of these properties will be sold in  however  given current market conditions  it may ii 
table of contents take longer to liquidate some of these properties 
in  we decreased the carrying value of some of these properties by million to reflect difficult market conditions for industrial and warehouse properties in the geographic areas where these properties are located 
however  these write downs were partially offset by million of gains realized on sales of properties and equipment that we had written down in prior years 
we do not anticipate incurring any further charges related to our multi year restructuring and reorganization program  other than to the extent our estimated restructuring liabilities and the carrying value of idled assets differ from the amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of the liabilities or sale of the assets 
results of operations our results of operations are affected by numerous factors  including competition  general economic conditions  seasonal variation  raw material costs  mix of products sold  and plant utilization 
in addition  our results can be affected by the usual risks of doing business abroad  such as possible revaluation of currencies  export duties  quotas  restrictions on the transfer of funds and  in certain parts of the world  political instability 
we have not  to date  been materially affected by any such risk  but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring 
typically  demand for our products is higher during the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year 
weather conditions also affect the demand for our products  particularly for our fleece products 
in addition  athletic and activewear products are generally available from multiple sources and our customers often purchase products from more than one source 
to remain competitive  we review and adjust our pricing structure from time to time 
our product mix affects our overall gross profit margin 
additionally  plant utilization levels are important to our profitability because a substantial portion of our total production cost is fixed 
the cost of yarn is a significant component of our cost of goods sold 
as a result of our restructuring and reorganization program  in  we discontinued internal production of yarn and began purchasing all of our yarn from frontier yarns  frontier spinning and other third party suppliers 
yarn prices typically fluctuate principally as a result of supply and demand in the raw cotton and synthetic fibers markets 
while cotton prices are primarily affected by agricultural factors and commodity exchange behavior  fluctuations in petroleum prices can influence the prices of chemicals  dyestuffs and polyester yarn 
accordingly  we adjust the timing and size of our raw material purchases when necessary to minimize the impact of these market forces and pricing fluctuations

we purchased moving comfort in the third quarter of fiscal  which expanded our women s product offering to include performance sports underwear  shorts  pants  tops  and outerwear 
net sales in our mass retail channel were million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal the decrease was principally driven by lower sales of our jerzees activewear and mossy oak products to kmart 
our sales to kmart were million  a decrease of million from the million in fiscal despite this reduction  sales of our jerzees activewear products in this channel increased 
this increase was partially offset by lower sock sales in the channel

in fiscal  net sales for our international segment were million  an increase of  or million  and total dozens shipped increased over fiscal the increase in net sales and dozens shipped for the segment primarily reflects the favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and sales growth in markets such as europe and canada 
gross profit and gross margin 
our gross profit was million  or a gross margin  for fiscal versus a gross profit of million  or a gross margin  in the prior year 
during fiscal  our gross profit was positively impacted by the acquisitions of spalding  bike and moving comfort  our ongoing cost savings initiatives  lower inventory reserves for our russell athletic distribution center  and favorable lifo adjustments related to the liquidation of lifo inventory quantities 
the benefits we realized in from the factors above were offset by pricing pressures and lower volumes  primarily in the distributor market of the artwear channel  additional costs for new product features  higher pension and medical insurance costs  and higher raw material costs for cotton and polyester

the increases in sales and dozens shipped were primarily driven by new and expanded fall programs  such as a national expansion of men s and boys fleece at jcpenney and a national men s fleece program at sam s club 
other new and expanded programs which increased net sales include vintage varsity by russell athletic  the rollout of no show socks  a broadened product offering for mossy oak and the introduction of discus branded products at sears

to a lesser extent  sales and dozens shipped were also positively impacted by new and expanded programs in our college bookstore business 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales in our team sports business during the first half of fiscal  primarily due to order processing and shipping delays we experienced during the reconfiguration of our alexander city  alabama distribution center and during the implementation phase of our new order processing and fulfillment system 
these systems have been fully operational since june net sales in our mass retail channel increased million  or  to million  while overall dozens shipped were up from fiscal the increases in sales and dozens shipped were due to increased sales of our mossy oak and jerzees brands as well as increased sock sales

the facilities include a million senior secured revolving credit facility the revolver due april  of which million was outstanding  and million outstanding under our senior secured term loan the term loan  due ratably through april  and million in senior unsecured notes the senior notes due we used the net proceeds of the senior notes offering together with million of initial borrowings under the facilities to repay the outstanding balances  accrued interest  prepayment penalties and expenses under our previous revolving credit facility and long term notes  and to pay issuance costs 
during the second quarter  we incurred a million million after tax charge associated with the early retirement of debt 
the charge consisted of million related to prepayment penalties  fees and expenses associated with the early termination of our previous notes payable and the write off of million of unamortized loan costs associated with the extinguished debt 
borrowings under our facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment equal to of the net proceeds received by us from the issuance of any new or replacement debt securities excluding the issuance of the senior notes  and of the net proceeds received from the sale of certain of our assets 
the facilities and the senior notes impose certain restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to incur debt  grant liens  provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  pay dividends  make loans and investments  sell our assets  issue redeemable preferred stock and non guarantor subsidiary preferred stock  make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  make capital expenditures  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers or consolidation  engage in sale leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions  change our business  amend certain debt and other material agreements  including the indenture governing the senior notes and other documents governing any subordinated debt that we may issue in the future  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  and restrict distributions from subsidiaries 
the facilities require us to achieve a fixed charge coverage ratio of to through the next to last day of fiscal year  to through the next to last day of fiscal year  and to thereafter 
we also must maintain a maximum leverage ratio of to through the next to last day of fiscal year  to through the next to last day of fiscal year  and to thereafter 
we were in compliance with these covenants at the end of fiscal year  and we expect to remain in compliance with them in the foreseeable future 
under the facilities  pricing is adjusted quarterly based on our consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
for the majority of fiscal  variable interest on the revolver was either libor plus at january   or base rate plus at january   and on the term loan was either libor plus at january   or base rate plus at january   with an annual commitment fee on the unused portion of the facilities of 
these terms will continue to be in effect through the first quarter of  however  our rate on the revolver will change to libor plus  or base rate plus  and on the term loan to libor plus or base rate plus  beginning in the second quarter of ii 
table of contents if we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders  our debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders 
if our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay or refinance it 
even if we are able to obtain new financing  it may not be on commercially reasonable terms  or terms that are acceptable to us 
cross default provisions exist in the indenture governing our senior notes whereby a default on our senior notes would occur if we default on any covenant of any other debt agreement which has an outstanding balance in excess of million and such default causes an acceleration of the maturity date of the other indebtedness 
also  under cross default provisions in our facilities  a default would occur if we default on any covenant of any other debt agreement which has an outstanding balance in excess of million and such default causes an acceleration of the maturity date of the other indebtedness 
on march   we amended the facilities to  among other things lessen some of the restrictions on our ability to make acquisitions  permit us to make additional investments and guarantees  and allow us to repurchase a portion of our senior notes and capital stock  subject to annual limitations 
pension funding considerations 
our actual return on plan assets significantly improved from a loss in to a positive return of in  however  we still have an after tax minimum pension liability of approximately million at january  currently  there is no funding requirement to comply with our principal debt agreement  however  it is possible that we could be required to make a contribution as much as million to the qualified plan in fiscal adequacy of borrowing capacity 
availability under our revolver is subject to a borrowing base limitation that is determined based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
as of january   we had million in outstanding borrowings under the revolver and approximately million of availability remaining 
we also had million in cash available to fund ongoing operations 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that cash flow available from operations along with the availability under our revolver and cash on hand will be sufficient to operate our business  satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure requirements including the new honduras textile facility  and needs under our operational improvement program  and meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements  including debt service on our senior notes and the facilities  until the maturity of our facilities in contingencies

our yarn purchase commitment to frontier yarns is excluded but described below 
we are required to purchase certain minimum quantities of yarn on an annual basis from frontier yarns pursuant to a supply agreement

in addition  beginning in  the agreement may be terminated for any reason upon two years notice  but not prior to other than our purchase requirements under the supply agreement  we have no other required purchases or financial commitments to frontier yarns 
frontier yarns now supplies most of our yarn needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our financial risk management objectives are to minimize the potential impact of interest rate  foreign exchange rate and commodity price fluctuations on our earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage these risks  we may use various financial instruments  including interest rate swap agreements  commodity futures contracts and forward currency exchange contracts 
we only use traded instruments with major financial institutions as the counterparties to minimize the risk of credit loss 
refer to notes and of the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of our accounting policies and the extent of our use of such instruments 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our significant financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest rates  exchange rates and commodity prices as if these changes had occurred at january  the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate assumptions or quoted market prices where available 
these forward looking disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates or commodity prices 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
at january   our outstanding debt totaled million  which consisted of fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
based on our average outstanding borrowings under our variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would negatively impact our annual pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
a one percentage point increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair market value of our fixed rate debt at january   by approximately million 
changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt will not have any impact on us unless we repurchase the debt in the open market 
currency exchange rate sensitivity 
we have foreign currency exposures related to buying  selling and financing in currencies other than our functional currencies 
we also have foreign currency exposure related to foreign denominated revenues and costs translated into us dollars 
these exposures are primarily concentrated in the euro  british pound sterling and mexican peso 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the risk associated with doing business in foreign currencies 
our policy is to hedge currency exposures of firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in non functional currencies to protect against the possibility of diminished cash flow and adverse impacts on earnings 
a ten percentage point adverse change in the foreign currency spot rates would decrease the fair market value of our foreign currency forward contracts held at january   by million 
changes in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts will not have any impact on our results of operations unless these contracts are deemed to be ineffective at hedging currency exposures of anticipated transactions 
we generally view our net investments in foreign subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than the us dollar as long term 
as a result  we generally do not hedge these net investments

table of contents commodity price sensitivity 
the availability and price of cotton is subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather conditions  governmental regulations  economic climate or other unforeseen circumstances 
we are purchasing yarn primarily from frontier yarns  frontier spinning and other third parties  and our yarn pricing will continue to be directly impacted by the price of cotton 
we did not have any outstanding cotton futures contracts at january
