item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto included under item of this annual report 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and other sections of this annual report contain forward looking statements relating to future results of the company 
such forward looking statements are identified by use of forward looking words such as anticipates  believes  plans  estimates  expects  and intends or words or phrases of similar expression 
these forward looking statements are subject to management decisions and various assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to changes in political and economic conditions  changes in demand for the company s products  acceptance of new products  changes in conditions in the various geographic markets where the company does business  technology developments affecting the company s products  changes in laws and regulations  and those matters discussed in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission sec 
accordingly  actual circumstances and results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require  in some cases  that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
estimates are based on currently known facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
actual results could differ from these estimates  assumptions and judgments and these differences could be material 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists eg a wholesale purchase order or retail sales invoice  the sales arrangement specifies a fixed or determinable sales price  product is shipped or services are provided to the customer  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
this generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent retailers or  in the case of ethan allen owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
recorded sales provide for estimated returns and allowances 
the company permits retail customers to return defective products and incorrect shipments  and terms offered by the company are standard for the industry 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
retail store acquisitions the company accounts for the acquisition of retail stores and related assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires application of the purchase method for all business combinations initiated after june  accounting for these transactions as purchase business combinations requires the allocation of purchase price paid to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the amount paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is accounted for as goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangible assets are to be evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
business insurance reserves the company has insurance programs in place to cover workers compensation and property casualty claims 
the insurance programs  which are funded through self insured retention  are subject to various stop loss limitations 
the company accrues estimated losses using actuarial models and assumptions based on historical loss experience 
although management believes that the insurance reserves are adequate  the reserve estimates are based on historical experience  which may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate insurance reserves are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
the company adjusts insurance reserves  as needed  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
other loss reserves the company has a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  tax liabilities  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with the company s counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future

the adjustment reflects the change in the elimination entry for profit in ending inventory 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue for fiscal was million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal consolidated revenue of million 
net sales for the period reflect the delivery of product associated with an increased level of booked orders and related backlog noted throughout most of the year 
such order levels are reflective of i the continued expansion and strategic re positioning of the company s retail segment  and ii an increase in the incoming order rate resulting  primarily  from an increased level of consumer confidence and an improved us economy  both of which were sustained for much of the last twelve months  and from the success of recent product introductions  some of which have been introduced in accordance with the company s everyday value pricing strategy 
these positive factors were partially offset  to some degree  by softer business conditions during the last three months of the fiscal year likely attributable to consumer concerns with respect to rising fuel prices  the threat of increasing interest rates  and the continued unsettled geo political environment 
total wholesale revenue for fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal  representing a million increase 
as stated previously  the company experienced an increase in the incoming order rate as a result  primarily  of improved consumer spending habits and a sustained strengthening of the us economy throughout most of the fiscal year 
to a lesser extent  wholesale sales volume was also positively impacted by two additional shipping days in the current year as compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these increases were lower than anticipated shipments stemming from i longer lead times on selected case good items as a result of the re allocation of production associated with the closure of two plants announced in april  and ii modest delays in receiving certain upholstery related import shipments both finished goods and raw materials 
total retail revenue from ethan allen owned stores for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
this increase in retail delivered sales by ethan allen owned stores was attributable to an increase in sales generated by newly opened including relocations or acquired stores of million  and an increase in comparable store delivered sales of million  or  partially offset by a decrease resulting from closed stores  which generated million fewer sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal the number of ethan allen owned stores increased to as of june  as compared to as of june  during that twelve month period  the company acquired stores from an independent retailer  closed store and opened stores  of which were relocations

subsequent to the company s acquisition of the minority interest  the assets of store were sold to the joint venture partner 
while the operations of these stores have been reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements since inception of the joint venture as a result of the company s majority ownership  the stores have not been previously included in the company s store count due to the fact that the stores were independently managed 
comparable stores are those which have been operating for at least months 
minimal net sales  derived from the delivery of customer ordered product  are generated during the first three months of operations of newly opened stores 
stores acquired from retailers are included in comparable store sales in their th full month of ethan allen owned operations 
total booked orders  which include wholesale orders and written business of ethan allen owned retail stores  increased from the prior year

these increases are indicative of the continued expansion and strategic re positioning of the company s retail segment  an increase in consumer confidence and a period of sustained economic improvement for most of the last twelve months 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to a higher proportionate share of retail sales to total sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and an overall increase in sales volume as a result of the company servicing the increased level of backlog noted throughout much of the past year 
these favorable variances were partially offset by increased costs associated with unabsorbed overhead at the company s manufacturing facilities resulting  primarily  from excess capacity  particularly during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  and  to a lesser extent  a modest decline in retail gross profit as a result of the sell off of floor inventory necessary to make room for new product introductions

income tax expense totaled million for the year ended june  as compared to million for the year ended june  the company s effective tax rate was for june as compared to for june the higher effective tax rate is a result of recently enacted changes within certain state tax legislation  and increased state income tax liability arising in connection with the operation of a greater number of company owned stores  some of which are located in new jurisdictions

as a result of these factors  consumer confidence deteriorated and the incoming order rate was adversely impacted 
total wholesale revenue for fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal  representing a million increase 
the wholesale segment experienced only marginal growth as a result of the challenges posed by the state of the us economy during the past year and the geo political concerns leading up to  during  and in the aftermath of  the war with iraq

business outlook we believe the business outlook for our industry continues to show signs of improvement 
encouraging signs noted during much of the past year seemed to indicate that improved levels of consumer confidence and a strengthening of the economy were  for the most part  sustainable 
the us economy appears to be benefiting from positive employment trends and an interest rate environment which  despite recent actions taken by the federal reserve board the board  continues to be favorable 
while the board recently took steps to increase short term interest rates for the first time in four years basis points effective june  and basis points effective august   their comments suggest a measured approach toward future interest rate increases with the objective of returning rates to a level appropriate to maintain a healthy economy 
we believe that the modest increases initiated by the board will have little negative effect on the increased levels of refinancing activity and housing purchases noted during this recent period of historically low interest rates 
these combined factors seem to have had a positive effect on consumer spending habits which is reflected in the company s incoming order trends noted during the past year 
if these apparent signs of economic recovery continue and prove to be sustainable  we believe the longer term outlook is promising as well 
as the economy strengthens  however  it is also possible that costs associated with production including raw materials and labor  distribution including freight and fuel charges  and retail operations including compensation  delivery and warehousing  occupancy and advertising expenses may increase 
similarly  continued increases in interest rates could serve to adversely impact the level of discretionary spending on the part of consumers 
we cannot reasonably predict when  or to what extent  such events may occur or what effect  if any  such events may have on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we continue to believe that there is considerable interest on the part of consumers to invest in their homes 
we also believe that this interest has  until recently  been restrained by such factors as high unemployment  sluggish consumer confidence levels and the fact that many home buyers stretched themselves financially to purchase as much house as possible in the recent low rate environment 
as the economy improves and this interest in home decorating continues to emerge  as we anticipate it will  we believe we will be well positioned to take advantage of the long awaited increase in demand as a result of i our established brand  ii our comprehensive complement of home decorating solutions  and iii our vertically integrated business model

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company s policy has been to utilize united states dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements
