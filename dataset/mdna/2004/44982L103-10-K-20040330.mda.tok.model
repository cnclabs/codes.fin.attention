item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our results of operations and our financial condition together with our consolidated subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the statement of operations  including trends which might appear  are not necessarily indicative of future operations 
overview our business over the past few years  we have restructured the company around our higher gross margin businesses 
in  our organization moved from being technology focused immersive video solutions  transaction services and immersive still solutions to being market focused in order to better serve the needs of our customers 
we are now organized into three business units ipix security  ipix ad technologies and ipix infomedia  respectively 
ipix security provides security and surveillance products and services for commercial and governmental customers 
ipix ad technologies focuses on the sale of complete solutions to customers who rely on visual data to create effective directional advertising such as publishers of newspaper classifieds  yellow page directories  on line auctions  real estate and autos classifieds 
ipix infomedia focuses on the sale of immersive still technology licenses for the on line real estate  travel and hospitality and visual documentation markets 
business trends and conditions substantially all of our recurring revenue is derived from transaction fees generated by our ad technologies business unit 
in particular  ebay represented approximately of total revenue for revenues in the quarter and year ended december  include a one time million license fee from ebay for our rimfire technology and other services 
as announced in june  we amended our then current commercial agreement with ebay  which was subsequently extended by ebay to october  for a final million additional fee 
we no longer provide any products or services to ebay as of november  we continue to diversify and add additional ad technologies customers and are currently targeting image management for publications  on line and in print classified advertising and other business opportunities 

table of contents our immersive technology used by the infomedia business unit primarily generates revenues in two ways licenses of software and the sale of camera equipment 
in the past  we utilized keys to license our infomedia technology to capture and save a single immersive image 
with the launch of interactive studios  we now offer time based seat or user licenses which permit an unlimited number of immersive images to be captured and saved within a specific time period  usually a year 
we sell our immersive products and services primarily into the real estate  travel and hospitality and visual documentation markets 
the cost of sales for our licenses is low in proportion to the related revenue 
the cost of sales for the sale of camera equipment has generally been to of related revenues 
we continue to develop our immersive imaging business for the security and surveillance market 
we also provide professional services to customers that request specific customizations or integrations of our products and services 
providing professional services is labor intensive  and our cost of sales for professional service tends to be to of revenues 
ipix international in the third quarter of  we entered into license  distribution and trademark agreements with soroof international  a saudi arabia based corporation soroof 
under the agreements  soroof became the exclusive distributor for ipix infomedia products outside of north america and asia through soroof s newly established entity  ipix international ipix i 
the agreement  effective july   expires december   unless renewed 
ipix i has an exclusive license to develop integrated solutions for markets including real estate  travel and tourism and other markets in which on line marketing is critical 
we provide certain hosting services during the term of the agreements 
under the terms of the agreements  we received a minority equity interest in ipix i  however  we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over ipix i operations 
we account for the investment in ipix i on the cost basis  not as a variable interest entity under fin we did not make any capital contributions to ipix i and we have no commitments to fund ipix i 
we do have the right  however  but not the obligation  to purchase ipix i from soroof after december  for consideration as defined in the agreements 
during the six months ended december   we recognized million of revenue under these agreements 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue under these agreements 
on march   the parties mutually terminated these agreements and we returned our minority equity interest in ipix i 
the termination of the agreements did not have a material impact on our financial condition or expected result of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible receivables  intangible and other long lived assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  valuation allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets  and significant accruals 
we believe that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and our financial statements accurately reflect management s best estimate of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows for the periods presented 

table of contents management has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we derive revenue from product sales and services we provide to customers 
product revenue includes infomedia hardware and licenses  ipix security hardware and licenses  as well as ad technology license revenue 
service revenues are primarily from transactions where a seller uses our image management products to enhance their on line offering 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment or delivery provided there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  there are no significant vendor obligations  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
initial license fees are recognized when a contract exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  software delivery has occurred and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
if there are continuing obligations  then license fees are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
transaction hosting revenue is recognized ratably as transactions are performed provided there was persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee was fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable was reasonably assured 
revenue generated from professional services is recognized as the related services are performed 
when such professional services are combined with on going transaction services or are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software product  revenue from the entire arrangement is recognized while the transaction services are performed  on a percentage of completion method or not until the contract is completed in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and arb no 
 long term construction type contracts 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred are characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
where multiple elements exist in an arrangement  the arrangement fee is allocated to the different elements based upon verifiable objective evidence of the fair value of the elements  as governed under eitf  which is codified in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab multiple element arrangements primarily involve an arrangement with professional services and transaction hosting 
revenue is recognized as each element is earned  namely upon completion of the services  provided that the fair value of the undelivered element s has been determined  the delivered element has stand alone value  there is no right of return on delivered element s  and we are in control of delivery of the undelivered element s 
royalties derived from desktop imaging products were recognized as revenues upon receipt of the royalty sell through reports from customers  which are generally in the quarter following the quarter in which the sale by the customer took place 
payments received in advance are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably as obligations are fulfilled 
allowances for doubtful accounts significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the doubtful account allowances in any accounting period 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of expense recorded if management had different judgment or utilized different estimates 

table of contents goodwill under united states generally accepted accounting principles  we evaluated goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we made assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the goodwill 
these estimates included forecasted revenues and operating expenses  which are inherently difficult to predict 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill is a critical accounting estimate because it requires company management to make assumptions about fair values 
during the fourth quarter of  certain events  including the end of the agreement with ebay  led the company to perform an impairment review of goodwill 
the ebay agreement ended in november and was the primary source of cash flows for the technology associated with goodwill in the ad technologies business unit 
this review indicated that goodwill was being carried at amounts in excess of the fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows of the ad technologies business unit 
as a result  an impairment charge was recorded to expense in the year ended december  significant accruals  including restructuring charges and sales tax we recorded restructuring charges associated with vacated facilities 
the key assumptions associated with these charges include the timing and amount of sub lease income 
in addition  in establishing and providing for sales tax accruals  we make judgments based on the actual tax laws and guidance 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding tax liabilities are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may materially affect our future financial results 
restructuring actions we executed several restructuring actions throughout and these actions and the charges relating to them are described below 
on march   we had employees  but by the end of the second quarter we had reduced our workforce by approximately positions 
the reductions were primarily in the full service virtual real estate business 
the first quarter reductions resulted in a restructuring charge of million 
in the second quarter of  we reorganized our management personnel  closed our sales offices throughout the us and made further reductions in our workforce 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a million restructuring charge in the second quarter of included in is a million impairment charge related to the write off of the unamortized portion of our directors and officers insurance policy 
we were required to obtain a new policy due to the change in control related to our financing 
in september  million of restructuring charges were recorded related to expenses associated primarily with a negotiated buy out of certain lease obligations for previously vacated offices 
we paid approximately million during the fourth quarter of to end our continuing obligations under those leases 
during october  million of restructuring charges were recorded related to expenses associated with the lease obligations from previously vacated office space in san ramon  ca

in addition  our recurring revenues from our commercial agreement with ebay ended in which represented approximately of our total revenue in with the loss of revenues from our largest customer  we are attempting to diversify and add new ad technology customers 
our prospects should be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the internet 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  be able to continue to deliver high quality products and services  respond to highly competitive developments  attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  implement and successfully execute our marketing plans  continue to upgrade our technologies  develop new distribution channels  and improve our operational and financial systems 
although our revenue grew significantly in our early history  during recent periods  we have been unable to sustain this growth and have had to reduce our expense structure 
therefore  you should not consider our historical growth indicative of future revenue levels or operating results 
in order to reduce our operating cost structure to a sustainable level commensurate with our revenues  we have gone through several restructurings during the last three years 
we began with three business units all at different stages in their development 
the ipix security group has developed products based upon our proven immersive technology and is focused on a large global market opportunity security and surveillance 
during the first quarter of  the group successfully completed beta trial testing of its new products 
in march and april  the group will launch its new products 

table of contents the ad technologies group has proven technology  strong customer references and is focused on a large global market opportunity improving on line advertising 
in  however  the group must rebuild its revenue base given the change in its relationship with its largest customer  ebay  which represented of our revenues in the infomedia group also has proven technology and strong customer references 
in february  the group launched a new product called interactive studios 
with this launch  the group also announced that after  they would no longer be selling one use keys to their core technology 
instead  interactive studio will be sold as a software platform under primarily annual licenses allowing for unlimited usage 
the group will continue to sell cameras  lens and other equipment that are used with the studio by professional immersive photographers 
in addition  we are subject to generally prevailing economic conditions and  as such  our success in will be dependent upon our ability to provide quality products and services  the success of our customers and the appropriations processes of various commercial and governmental entities 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in our image management business and in the development  sale and marketing of new products for the security market  which may consume our cash reserves 
we are monitoring our cash position carefully and evaluating our future operating cash requirements in the context of our strategy  business objectives and expected business performance 
our focus in will be to manage cash requirements and focus our operations on efficient spending

 as revised  requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of fin r are effective immediately for all arrangements entered into after january  for arrangements entered into prior to february   we are required to adopt the provisions of fin r in the first quarter of the adoption of fin r is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations
