item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  integrate  install and sell products  systems and software used in the ground based portion of satellite communication systems to receive  and transmit data  video  audio and internet over satellite  microwave and cable communications networks 
our products are used in applications for telephone  data  video and audio broadcast communications  private and corporate data networks  internet applications  and digital television for cable and network broadcast 
through our network of international offices and service centers  we serve customers in over countries  including customers in the television broadcast industry  international telecommunications companies  internet service providers  private communications networks  network and cable television and the united states government 
we reported revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fluctuation of revenues is due to the downturn in the telecommunications industry over the last couple of years 
our customers trend has been to reduce capital expenditures to the most urgent needs 
we believe the urgency for these companies to begin expending funds for new capital equipment will increase in the near term as older products fail and as newer product technologies improve the operating efficiencies of the users  saving them money over use of their older technologies 
we have recently introduced new products with the latest technologies that can help our customers reduce their operational costs while increasing their capacity to deliver services 
on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the assets of tiernan communications  inc for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we manufacture the tiernan products  which are used in the television broadcast industry 
the acquisition has been recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price has been allocated to the assets purchased and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately million and has been recorded as goodwill  which was amortized on a straight line basis over seven years until the adoption of sfas no 
on january  during the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and address the economic slowdown and negative industry conditions 
this plan included the reduction in force of approximately of our workforce in the manufacturing  research and development and sales departments  the abandonment of certain non performing and under performing product lines and a provision for the excess space created at the san diego facility as a result of these cost cutting measures 
this effort resulted in a charge to our operating expenses of approximately million  of which  was charged to cost of sales and the balance was charged to restructuring charge 
this amount included  in severance costs 
during the year ended december   we paid all charges except for  in lease exit costs 
during the year ended december    in lease exit costs was paid and  remained to be paid through february during the year ended december   we further reduced our workforce to full time employees from and at december  and  respectively 
these reductions allowed the company to reduce employee related expenses by approximately million per year 
additionally  costs of sales were reduced which translated to higher gross margins and  because of the lower operating costs  to higher net earnings 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company s management to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies based upon historical results  anticipated future events and various other assumptions  factors  and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements relate to 
table of contents revenue recognition 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon the actual shipment of product and transfer of the risk of ownership from us  or our contract manufacturers  to our customers in accordance with sec staff bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended 
we do not sell through distributors and we do not use consignment resellers as a method of selling our products 
revenue from services principally consists of sales related to services for installation and integration of satellite earth stations and video and microwave hub stations and are recognized at the time the services are performed 
valuation of receivables 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as through the creation of reserves established for specific customers deemed marginal in their ability to pay based upon factors known at that time 
in general  if the financial condition of a customer was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation and impairment of intangible assets 
in assessing our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows  overall performance  identity and allocation and valuation of the assets including goodwill and other intangibles of our reporting units 
market prices are not readily available for certain businesses  unique physical assets  and most intangible assets to be valued in goodwill impairment tests 
therefore  we estimate fair values using estimating techniques and assumptions that are matters of judgment 
our transitional impairment analysis of goodwill as of january   as required by sfas no 
 yielded an impairment charge of million  recorded in as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we have no remaining goodwill on our balance sheet as of december  and warranty liability 
we provide limited warranties on certain of our products and systems for periods generally not exceeding two years 
estimated warranty costs for potential product liability and warranty claims based on our claim experience are accrued as cost of sales at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our vendors  our warranty liability is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s present estimates  additional warranty liabilities may be required 
valuation of inventories 
inventories  consisting of satellite modems and related products  are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
our inventories include high technology components and systems sold into rapidly changing and competitive markets  whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value 
assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes 
management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
in addition  we consider historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the period such determination was made 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our net sales increased 
to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to improved market conditions and strengthening of the economy as a 
table of contents whole during the last half of the year ended december  compared to the same period in while revenues did not increase dramatically from year to year  the first three months of was depressed  in terms of sales  resulting in our lowest volume of quarterly sales in years 
sales during the last three quarters of the year continuously improved and  in total  the last nine months of the year increased by over the prior year s last nine months 
we believe our customers will begin to increase orders for our newest products and sales should increase further during the next few years 
our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased by to during the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the change in cost of sales as a percent of net sales is primarily due to a change in our product and services mix 
our service and installation business  which provides lower gross margins relative to certain products such as satellite modems  decreased to of sales for the year ended december  from in the prior year 
sales from services typically produce margins in the to range compared to the satellite modem products that produce margins in the to range 
our newest products enable us to sell software upgrades over a satellite link or via email or through the use of a cdrom or pcm cia card that is plugged into the product 
these upgrades can increase our sales by up to of the hardware sales price without significant increases in costs 
this should help our margins increase further during the years to come  especially after we have an established base of product deployed in the field 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to million  or of net sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  expenses attributable to our tender offer for wegener corporation amounted to approximately  during the second quarter of the year 
before these expenses  selling  general and administrative costs decreased slightly from the prior year 
most of our selling  general and administrative expenses are fixed and do not change when sales fluctuate 
research and development expenditures decreased to million  or of net sales during the year ended december  from million  or of net sales  during the year ended december  research and development costs decreased during the year ended december  by approximately million  as we benefited from the cost savings initiatives put into place in we remain committed to invest in our future through technological advances and our efforts to improve our older product lines for manufacturability and lower costs 
our research and development personnel concentrate on technology for the satellite and microwave communications  telecommunications  and cable television industries  as well as the tiernan product lines  which target the digital television broadcast industry 
as a result of the increase in our gross profit and our lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales  we recorded earnings from operations of million during year ended december  compared to an operating loss of million during the year ended december  interest expense decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  due to lower capitalized lease obligations during the current fiscal year compared to the year ended december  interest income increased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  interest income increased as a result of our approximately million average cash balance on hand during the year ended december  compared to approximately million average balance during the prior year  despite lower average interest rates of approximately during the current period compared to approximately for the prior period 
we keep our cash in money market accounts and short term aaa rated investments maturing in seven to twenty eight day increments 
we recorded income tax expense in the year ended december  of million compared to an income tax benefit of  in the year ended december  the increase in expense is due to taxable income generated in the current fiscal year compared to a loss in the prior year 
at december   we provided a full valuation allowance against our remaining deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
to the extent that we continue to experience profitable operations  we will evaluate the need for the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in future periods 
additionally  due to the stock sale as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  it is possible that the use of net operating loss carryforwards may be limited in accordance with section of the internal revenue code 
should we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would result in an income tax benefit in the period such a determination was made 
new orders booked bookings decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we believe this trend is due to the reluctance of our customers to place long term capital equipment 
table of contents orders in the aftermath of the economic downturn of the last few years 
while we believe this trend will reverse itself over time  there can be no assurance that the trend will reverse itself soon  if at all 
our backlog of orders to be shipped  which are unshipped orders from the prior period plus new orders booked less orders shipped during the period  was million as of december  a decrease of from the million in backlog as of december  we believe that this reduction is a result of our customers desires to reduce their inventory levels  shorten cycle times for filling orders and to keep their capital equipment orders to a minimum 
we expect that this trend will continue to keep our backlog depressed but will not reduce our backlog below million to million within the next year 
however  future backlogs could be reduced as we further improve our cycle times to compete with other suppliers of our product lines 
our backlog consists of orders as evidenced by written contracts and or purchase orders from customers with fixed pricing and delivery dates 
we charge cancellation charges for orders that cancel and the net difference between the backlog amount and the cancellation charge is recorded as a negative booking 
there is no guarantee that cancellation charges will ultimately be paid to us 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our net sales decreased to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease is primarily attributable to the lingering effects of the economic slowdown over the last two years and was partially offset by full year sales of products from the tiernan acquisition compared to approximately months of those sales during our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased by to during the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the change in costs as a percent of sales is primarily due to changes in the mix of products shipped  namely  the typically lower margins on the armer products and higher unabsorbed overhead from our core businesses due to the lower sales during the current year 
other factors include a  inventory write down taken in the third quarter  which was a result of the abandonment of certain non performing and under performing product lines and was related to the reduction of our workforce related to manufacturing activities to employees at december  from employees at december   and the abandonment of certain manufacturing facilities as is discussed further below 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased to million  or of sales  during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses during the year is primarily attributed to the cost saving initiatives put in place during the year as a result of the continued depressed market place 
these initiatives included the reduction of our workforce related to these activities to employees at december  from employees at december   the reduction of our utilized work space in the san diego facility from approximately  square feet at december  to approximately  square feet at december  the decrease was partially offset by increased spending on our information technologies during the year of approximately  to upgrade our management information systems in our phoenix facility 
the increase as a percentage of sales was due to the lower sales amounts during the current year compared to the prior period 
research and development expenditures decreased to million  or of sales during the year ended december  from million  or of sales  during the year ended december  we remain committed to invest in our future through technological advances and our efforts to improve our older product lines for manufacturability and lower costs  however  we found it necessary  during the current year  to scale back on these expenditures  in light of the current market situation 
our efforts to reduce costs included the reduction of our workforce related to our research efforts to employees at december  from employees at december  our research and development personnel concentrate on technology for the satellite and microwave communications  telecommunications  and cable television industries  as well as the newly acquired tiernan product lines  which target the digital television broadcast industry 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of  related to the write down of purchased technologies 
this intangible asset  which was originally valued at million  was identified as the fair value of proprietary technologies purchased in the comstream acquisition and was being amortized on a straight line basis over the expected life of the asset  which was originally estimated to be years 
it was determined during the third quarter restructuring effort  that this asset had been impaired because the products with which the technologies were associated have been slow moving and rendered low margins and  therefore  we determined to abandon the product lines in favor of newer technologies 
this non cash charge will eliminate the amortization expense related to the intangible asset  which amounted to approximately  per year 

table of contents during the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan to reduce costs and address the economic slowdown and negative industry conditions 
this restructuring plan included the reduction in force of approximately of our workforce in the manufacturing  research and development and sales departments and a provision for the excess space created as a result of these cost cutting measures 
this effort resulted in a charge to our operating expenses of approximately million 
the expense related to the reduction in force was  as of december   we have reduced our workforce from employees at december  to employees  reduced our utilized work space in the san diego facility from approximately  square feet at december  to  square feet  and paid all charges except for  in lease exit costs  which will be paid over the lease term expiring in february as a result of the decrease in our gross profit and our higher operating costs  we recorded a loss from operations of million during compared to earnings of million in interest expense increased to  in from  in  due to higher capitalized lease obligations during the current fiscal year compared to the year ended december  interest income decreased to  in from  in though our average cash balance on hand during the year ended december  increased to million from million during  the lower average interest rate earned during the year reduced to compared to average in the prior year 
we recorded an income tax benefit in of  due to a tax refund  compared to an income tax expense of million in the decrease in expense is due to the loss incurred in the current fiscal year compared to net income in the prior year 
due to the net loss experienced in and the priority in which net operating loss carryforwards are utilized  we provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets arising in we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january   the first day of fiscal therefore  the amortization of goodwill  which was approximately  for the year ended december   was suspended effective on that date 
we also performed our transitional impairment analysis of goodwill as of january   as required by sfas no 
this analysis yielded an impairment charge of million  recorded in as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we have no remaining goodwill on our balance sheet as of december  including restructuring and asset impairment charges and the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  the company reported a net loss of million  or per share on a fully diluted basis for net income was million or per fully diluted share for new orders booked bookings decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to the economic slowdown over the prior year 
our backlog of orders to be shipped  which are unshipped orders from the prior period plus new orders booked less orders shipped during the period  was million as of december   a decrease of from the million in backlog as of december  this reduction is a direct result of the lower bookings compared to sales during the current period 
our backlog consists of orders as evidenced by written contracts and or purchase orders from customers with fixed pricing and delivery dates 
we charge cancellation charges for orders that cancel and the net difference between the backlog amount and the cancellation charge is recorded as a negative booking 
there is no guarantee that cancellation charges will ultimately be paid to us 
liquidity and capital resources we had working capital of million at december   which represents an increase of million  or  from million at december  our working capital increased primarily as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable  inventory and deferred tax assets of  million and million  respectively 
please see the following discussion of related events 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the change is primarily due to a decrease in inventories of million to million for the year ended december   compared to a decrease in inventories of million during the year ended december  in addition  accounts receivable decreased by  to million for the year ended december   compared to a decrease of million during the year ended december  accounts payable increased  during the year ended december  compared to a decrease of  for the year ended december  we recorded a 
table of contents reduction in deferred tax assets of million during the year ended december  accrued expense decreased by only  during the year ended december  compared to a decrease of  during this activity  which resulted in positive changes in the company s cash flow was increased by net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net loss of million for the year ended december  however  the net loss during the year ended december  included items that did not have an effect on cash  such as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million which represented the impairment of the remaining goodwill related to prior year acquisitions  and an asset impairment charge of million and depreciation and amortization of million  which were included in the net loss for the year ended december  but had no effect on cash 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  and cash used in operating activities of million during the year ended december  cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was the result of a reduction in capital expenditures of  compared to the prior year  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the disposal of assets of  the decrease in net cash used in investing activities is primarily due to assets  net of cash  acquired from tiernan communications in the amount of million during the year ended december  in addition  capital expenditures were reduced to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  we derived net cash from financing activities of million   and  during the years ended december    and  respectively 
during the year ended december   net cash from financing activities was generated primarily through the exercise of stock options and stock purchased through our employee stock purchase plan  which provided net proceeds of million and  respectively

we paid a facility fee of for the committed portion of the arrangement whether or not any amounts are actually drawn on the line of credit 
at december   we had no borrowings against the line of credit 
the credit agreement expired on june  and was not renewed 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand and anticipated future cash receipts will be sufficient to meet our obligations as they become due for the next twelve months 
however  a decrease in our sales or demand for our products or services would likely affect our working capital amounts 
as part of our business strategy  we occasionally evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses  products and technologies 
accordingly  a portion of our available cash may be used at any time for the acquisition of complementary products or businesses 
these potential transactions may require substantial capital resources  which  in turn  may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
there are no assurances that we will be able to consummate any of these transactions
