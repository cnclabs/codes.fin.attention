item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations audit committee examination in november  the company announced that it would delay the filing of its quarterly report on form q because an examination had been commenced by its audit committee 
the company s audit committee  with the assistance of independent outside counsel and independent outside consultants  was examining certain matters  principally the company s recognition of revenue associated with its licensing transactionsin and in february  the company s audit committee completed its examination 
during the course of the examination  the audit committee and its outside advisors conducted a thorough review of the company s licensing transactions in and  as well as a review of certain other matters 
as a result of its examination  the audit committee concluded that no changes were required to the results previously announced for the quarter ended september   or any prior reporting period 
in its review  the audit committee concluded that there were no accounting irregularities and that no member of the company s management engaged in misconduct in connection with the matters under examination 
during the course of its examination  the audit committee identified certain areas in which the company s control environment should be improved 
as a result  the company  under the direction of the audit committee and the board of directors  is taking steps to strengthen the company s controls 
in connection with these steps  the company is adopting a policy requiring additional documentation of items necessary for licensing revenue recognition decisions  increasing the standardization of licensing deliverables and post contract customer support for revenue recognition purposes  and formalizing its licensing deal review process 
the company only began to report revenues from licensing transactions in these enhancements to the company s controls are in part designed to help the company adapt to the growing complexity and importance of this additional component of its business strategy 
the company is also in the process of adopting and implementing internal measures designed to enhance the company s overall internal control environment and to increase the level of communication within the management team and between the management team and the board of directors  including the audit committee 
these measures include restructuring some reporting relationships among management and evaluating and redefining management roles and responsibilities 
the company may receive and consider additional recommendations designed to enhance its overall internal control environment 
the company believes that the steps it has taken and its continued monitoring and improvement of its internal controls are and will remain sufficient to ensure continued compliance with law

licensing  in addition to creating revenue and return on engineering investment in market segments we choose not to address  creates products complementary to our own that expand the markets for our products and help to improve industry wide interoperability 
silicon image is a leader in the global pc display arena with its innovative panellink digital interconnect technology  which enables an all digital connection between pc host systems and digital displays such as lcd monitors  plasma displays and projectors 
panellink technology is the basis for the dvi industry standard the company pioneered and remains the most popular dvi implementation with more than million units shipped to date 
in  in order to decrease our absolute dependence on the pc business  we embarked upon a plan to diversify into the ce and storage markets 
products sold into the pc market have been declining as a percentage of our total revenues and generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in leveraging our core technology and standards setting expertise  silicon image is driving hdmi high definition multimedia interface  the new digital interface standard for the consumer electronics market 
introduced by founders hitachi  matsushita panasonic  philips  silicon image  sony  thomson and toshiba  hdmi enables the distribution of uncompressed  high definition video and multi channel audio in a single  all digital interface that dramatically simplifies cabling 
silicon image s hdmi technology is marketed under the panellink cinema brand and includes high bandwidth digital content protection hdcp  which is supported by certain hollywood studios as the technology of choice for the secure distribution of premium content 
the panellink cinema chip and the first hdmi compliant silicon are on the market and are featured in the world s first consumer electronics products with hdmi functionality 
products sold into the ce market have been increasing as a percentage of our total revenues and generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in our ce products offer a securable interface for transmission of digital video and audio to consumer devices  such as digital tvs and dvd players 
demand for these products will be driven primarily by the adoption rate of new technologies  such as high definition multimedia interface hdmi and high bandwidth digital content protection hdcp 
in the storage market  silicon image has assumed a leadership role in serial ata sata  the new high bandwidth  point to point interface that is replacing parallel ata in desktop storage and making inroads in the enterprise arena due to its price performance 
silicon image is a leading supplier of discrete sata devices with hundreds of motherboard and add in card design wins 
silicon image s satalink branded solutions are fully sata compliant and offer advanced features and capabilities such as native command queuing  port multiplier capability and atapi support 
silicon image also supplies high performance  low power fibre channel serializer deserializer serdes to leading switch manufacturers 
semiconductor products sold into the storage market have been increasing as a percentage of our total revenues and generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in demand for our storage semiconductor products is dependent upon the rate at which interface technology transitions from parallel to serial  and the extent to which sata and fibre channel functionality are integrated into chip sets and controllers offered by other companies  which would make our discrete devices unnecessary 
sales of storage subsystems products generated of our revenue in  of our revenue in  and of our revenue in we are phasing out our storage subsystems products 
in conjunction with our decision to phase out our storage subsystems products  we decided to design products for and or license our technology to third parties in this market 
license revenue is recognized when an agreement with a licensee exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we expect to meet these criteria and recognize revenue at the time we deliver the agreed upon items 
however  we may defer recognition of revenue until cash is received if collection is not reasonably assured at the time of delivery 
a number of our license agreements require customer acceptance of deliverables  in which case we would defer recognition of revenue until the licensee has accepted the deliverables and either payment has been received or is expected within days of acceptance 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history base of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
to date  such true up adjustments have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty payments are received 
development revenue is recognized when project milestones have been completed and acknowledged by the other party to the development agreement and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain instances  we recognize development revenue using the lesser of non refundable cash received or the results of using a proportional performance measure 
our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales because we believe this activity can help us monetize our intellectual property as well as accelerate adoption curves associated with our technology 
most of our licenses include a field of use restriction that prevents the licensee from building a chip in direct competition with those market segments we have chosen to pursue 
revenue from development  licensing and royalties accounted for  and of our revenues  and represented  and of our total gross margin  for  and  respectively 
licensing contracts are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items  and customer acceptances 
although we attempt to make these factors predictable  many of these factors require significant judgments 
licensing revenues have fluctuated significantly from period to period and may continue to do so in the future  because of their high margin content they can have a disproportionate impact on gross margins and profitability 
in october  we raised approximately million in our initial public offering 
we have incurred losses in all but one quarterly period since our inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
prior to we focused most of our efforts on the sale and development of panellink transmitters  receivers and controllers for the pc display market 
in  we began focusing our resources on entering two new markets  storage and ce  which we believed would grow significantly and in which we believed we could apply our technology and expertise in high speed serial interfaces 
during  we acquired zillion  a developer of high speed transmission technology for data storage applications  and dvdo  a provider of digital video processing systems for the ce market 
in  we focused on accelerating our entry into the ce and storage markets  leveraging our ip into licensing revenue  and restructuring the company to improve profitability 
during  we acquired cmd  a provider of storage subsystems and semiconductors designed for storage area networks  and scl  a provider of mixed signal and high speed circuit designs 
during  we achieved double digit sequential revenue growth in each fiscal quarter  resulting in record annual revenue of million  which was a increase from revenue levels 
we also began to see the benefits of our diversification strategy  which resulted in establishing a presence in the ce and storage markets  both of which are expected to experience strong growth rates during the next several years 
additionally  we were able to successfully leverage our intellectual property to generate million of development  licensing and royalty revenue 
we also focused on improving our profitability and reducing our cash usage 
year during  we achieved significant growth  resulting in record annual revenue of million  representing a increase compared to we were also able to continue to take advantage of our diversification strategy effectively  which resulted in our being able to expand our presence in the ce and storage markets  both of which we expect will experience significant growth rates during the next several years 
additionally  we were able to successfully leverage our intellectual property to generate million of development  licensing and royalty revenue 
in we introduced our first hdmi products for the ce market 
hdmi is a new standard for digital video and audio transmission for consumer devices 
this standard was created by silicon image  together with sony  matsushita panasonic  philips  thomson rca  hitachi and toshiba  and with strong support from fox and universal studios  directv and echostar 
we believe that a majority of digital tvs  dvds and set top boxes will include a digital interconnect  whether it is dvi or hdmi  within the next five years 
we also believe that a majority of these digital interfaces will be secured  whether dvi or hdmi  with high definition content protection hdcp 
there has been initial market acceptance of our hdmi products and major ce manufacturers have already incorporated our products into several of their designs 
during the year we also opened an hdmi authorized testing center for testing of products for compliance with the hdmi specifications 
in the storage market  we had a number of new and advanced product offerings 
we were able to achieve numerous design wins with our satalink products 
in particular  there was widespread market acceptance of the pci to four port serial ata solutions for the pc and server markets and a number of major manufacturers incorporated our products into their motherboards 
we believe we are well positioned to continue to be in the forefront and benefit from an increasingly rapid rate of transition to serial ata technology 
furthermore we expect to leverage our storage expertise in the rapidly growing area of storage for ce storage devices 
additionally  our gb fibre channel solutions experienced strong growth as our major oem s have experienced increased strength in their businesses 
demand declined throughout the year for our parallel ata and usb products as the market began to transition to serial ata 
we expect demand for these legacy products to continue to decrease significantly throughout in the pc market  we introduced a number of new transmitter and receiver chips and in particular our next generation of panellink dvi receiver chips was well received and incorporated by several pc manufacturers 
these dvi solutions are also finding their way into ce devices 
in fact  according to displaysearch  an independent research firm  dvi is well positioned to enjoy rapid growth due to significant increases expected in its two largest target markets lcd monitor market and the lcd tv market the lcd monitor market is expected to grow from million units in to million units in and the lcd tv market is expected to grow from million units in to million units in consistent with the overall growth in the dvi ce market  we expect the dvi adoption rate to increase for the pc market during the next two years as quality  cost and content will make an all digital connection more attractive than an analog solution 
we also expect the prices of digital displays to continue to decrease  which we expect will increase demand for digital displays 
our transmitter products continued to experience competitive pressure  primarily from integration by the graphic chip suppliers such as ati and nvidia 
thine and texas instruments also remain competitors 
because of this increased competition we saw lower average selling prices for these products 
we expect graphic card manufacturers to continue to integrate a transmitter into their graphics chip  thus eliminating the need for a discrete transmitter device in many host products 
we believe that integration in the next two to three years will be limited to lower resolution technology  and that higher resolutions will continue to require a discrete transmitter to achieve high resolution quality 
we continued to lose market share in the receiver market during  as oems continued to use dual interface solutions in flat panels to accommodate both digital and analog signals 
in addition  we generated licensing revenue by licensing certain technology to companies for use in making products for the dual interface market 
during the year we also opened a dvi compliance test center 
on april   we issued approximately  shares of common stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of transwarp networks twn capital stock  and converted all outstanding twn options into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock 
the purchase price for this acquisition was approximately million 
approximately  shares of our issued common stock will be held in escrow for a period of eighteen months as collateral for indemnity obligations of the principal twn stockholders 
we also assumed twn s stock option stock issuance plan  under which a reserve of approximately  shares of our common stock remained available for future issuance 
this transaction has been accounted for as an asset purchase 
we expensed million of in process research and development and recorded tangible and intangible assets of million in connection with this transaction 
on july   the federal district court in richmond  virginia  upheld our interpretation of a previously agreed upon memorandum of understanding mou with genesis 
on august   the court entered a final judgment based on its july  ruling 
under the final judgment order  genesis was ordered to make a substantial cash payment  and make royalty payments  although genesis has made and continues to make cash payments to the court  it may not have made all the payments that are required under the final judgment order 
we filed motions for reimbursement of some of our expenses  including some of our legal fees  and for modification and or clarification of certain items of the judgment  and to hold genesis in contempt of court for breaching the protective order in the case by disclosing secret information to at least one of our competitors 
on december   the court granted our motions in part and denied them in part the court issued an amended judgment  and held genesis in contempt of court for breaching the protective order 
on january   genesis filed a notice of appeal 
to date we have not received any cash payments nor have we recognized any revenue associated with the matter 
under the settlement agreement  genesis was granted a royalty bearing license for the right to use certain non necessary patent claims referred to in the dvi adopters agreement 
in addition  upon genesis s becoming a signatory to the hdmi adopters agreement  genesis will be granted a royalty bearing license for the right to use these claims as part of their hdmi implementation 
genesis also was granted a royalty bearing license to expand use of certain dvi related patent claims to the consumer electronics marketplace 
during  we also focused on improving the company s profitability and reducing our cash usage rate 
our cash and short term investments increased by million in  versus a decline of million in outlook we expect revenue to increase from the level achieved in  and believe our revenue in the first quarter of will grow sequentially from the fourth quarter of we believe our expected revenue growth during will be driven by several factors 
first  dvi adoption rates are expected to increase as demand for notebook computers and graphics cards containing our products increase during the year 
second  in the ce market we have had a number of important design wins  some which begin mass production in early and we expect the production of other designs already in mass production to increase during the year 
as the ce industry continues to transition to an all digital solution  we expect the marketplace for our products to grow significantly 
third  serial ata adoption rates are expected to increase 
lastly  we expect our licensing market to continue to be attractive and as our licensing base grows  we also expect to see an increase in royalty revenues 
among the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by our assumptions include the rate at which the pc market adopts dvi  acceptance of all digital solutions in the pc market  ce market acceptance of our dvi with hdcp and hdmi products  the rate at which the storage market transitions to gb fibre channel switches and serial ata technology  consumer demand in the pc and ce markets  the availability of serial ata enabled hard drives and other peripherals  whether and how quickly oems are able to integrate transmitters in their graphics chips and serial ata functionality into their chip sets  our ability to leverage our intellectual property into licensing revenue and the ability of our semiconductor foundry vendors to manufacture our products in commercial volumes at an acceptable cost and in a timely manner 
in addition  our revenue remains subject to competition and general economic and market conditions  none of which can be accurately predicted 
we expect our gross margin percentage to increase slightly from levels as a result of higher licensing and royalty revenue  for which there is no associated cost of sales  manufacturing cost reductions on certain of our higher volume products  higher unit volume and shifts in product mix whereby higher margin ce products will grow faster than our pc or storage product lines that have lower gross margins 
these positive effects will be offset by declining average selling prices asps  especially for products in the pc market  and higher manufacturing overhead spending to support increased production levels for products in all three of our markets 
excluding non cash charges for stock compensation expense  we expect the dollar amount of our r d expense to increase approximately in r d expense will be incurred for enhancements to existing products and for further development of technology related to consumer electronics and storage applications 
excluding non cash charges for stock compensation expense  we expect the dollar amount of our sg a expense to increase approximately in  primarily as a result of increased headcount levels necessary to support our revenue growth 
we cannot predict the r d or sg a expenses including the non cash charges for stock compensation expense  which will fluctuate with changes in our stock price and volatility 
we expect to incur substantial non cash stock compensation expense in and future periods as a result of previous stock option repricings  stock options assumed in connection with our prior acquisitions  the issuance of stock options to consultants  and modifications to stock options 
we may also incur non cash stock compensation expense in connection with future acquisitions 
the amount of stock compensation expense in each period will fluctuate with changes in our stock price and volatility 
during and future periods  we may also incur non cash expenses for the impairment or amortization of intangible assets 
we will also incur legal fees in in conjunction with our patent infringement lawsuit against genesis  the recently completed audit committee examination  and other outstanding litigation 
the amount of legal fees incurred will depend on the duration of the litigation  as well as the nature and extent of the litigation activities 
we are not able to accurately estimate the amount of legal fees we will incur with respect to this matter  however  we do expect to incur substantial amounts through at least the fourth quarter of we estimate the costs associated with the conduct of the audit committee examination to be approximately million during the first quarter of pending litigation costs associated with the examination cannot be accurately projected for the following quarters and could be significant 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the decrease in and from levels can be attributed to our market diversification 
additionally  the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oem s rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of revenue was generated through distributors  compared to in and in our licensing revenue is not generated through distributors  and to the extent licensing revenue increases  we would expect a decrease in the percentage of our revenue generated through distributors 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales including licensing to customers in asia  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in   and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are part of flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
in september  we entered into an agreement with intel to develop and promote the adoption of a digital display interface specification 
in connection with this agreement  we granted intel a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
under the same agreement  we granted intel a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share upon achievement of a specified milestone that was reached during the first quarter of both of these warrants were exercised in may additionally  if a second specified milestone is achieved  which we do not believe is likely  we would be required to grant intel a third warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share 
the estimated fair value of the warrant at december  was million 
this warrant expires in september critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition for products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have rights of return  we recognize revenue upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are estimated based primarily on historical experience and are provided at the time of shipment 
the amount of sales returns and allowances has not been  and is not expected to be  material 
the majority of our products are sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns 
we recognize revenue based on our best estimate of when the distributor sold the product to its end customer based on point of sales reports received from our distributors 
due to the timing of receipt of these reports  we recognize distributor sell through using information that lags quarter end by one month 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is earned when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time our sales price to the distributor becomes fixed 
our revenue is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer on their shipments as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventories and activities 
if distributors incorrectly report their inventories or activities  or if our judgment is in error  it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income 
license revenue is recognized when an agreement with a licensee exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we expect to meet these criteria and recognize revenue at the time we deliver the agreed upon items 
however  we may defer recognition of revenue until cash is received if collection is not reasonably assured at the time of delivery 
a number of our license agreements require customer acceptance of deliverables  in which case we would defer recognition of revenue until the licensee has accepted the deliverables and either payment has been received or is expected within days of acceptance 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available  and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history base of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
to date  such true up adjustments have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty payments are received 
development revenue is recognized when project milestones have been completed and acknowledged by the other party to the development agreement  and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain instances  we recognize development revenue using the lesser of non refundable cash received or the results of using a proportional performance measure 
our license revenue recognition depends upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances 
many of these factors require significant judgments  and if our judgment is in error it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectibility of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer  and the reason for the delinquency 
write offs to date have not been material 
at december   we had million of gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of  while we endeavor to accurately estimate the allowance  we may record unanticipated write offs in the future 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of standard cost  determined on a first in first out basis  or market 
standard cost approximates actual cost 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory  and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months demand are written down to zero and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue 
while we endeavor to accurately predict demand and stock commensurate inventory levels  we may record unanticipated material inventory write downs in the future 
long lived assets consideration paid in connection with acquisitions is required to be allocated to the assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities acquired 
acquired assets and liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of fair value  which requires significant judgment with respect to future cash flows and discount rates 
for certain long lived assets  primarily fixed assets and intangible assets  we are required to estimate the useful life of the asset and recognize its cost as an expense over the useful life 
we use the straight line method to depreciate long lived assets 
we regularly compare the carrying value of long lived assets to our projection of future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets and in the event that the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we record an impairment charge against income equal to the excess of the carrying value over the asset s fair value 
predicting future cash flows attributable to a particular asset is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
goodwill we adopted the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on january  this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the business  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our business  there is significant judgment in determining such future cash flows 
we also consider market capitalization adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  marketable debt securities and debt on the date we perform the analysis 
based on our annual impairment test performed for  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
to date  as a result of our recurring losses we have provided a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
predicting future taxable income is difficult  and requires the use of significant judgment 
accrued liabilities certain of our accrued liabilities are based largely on estimates 
for instance  we record a liability on our balance sheet each period for the estimated cost of goods and services rendered to us  for which we have not received an invoice 
additionally  a component of our restructuring accrual related to a loss we expect to incur for excess leased facility space is based on numerous assumptions and estimates  such as the market value of the space and the time it will take to sublease the space 
our estimates are based on historical experience  input from sources outside the company  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates 
certain of our licensing agreements indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
stock based compensation expense we are required to determine the fair value of stock option grants to non employees  and to record the amount as an expense over the period during which services are provided to us 
management calculates the fair value of these stock option grants using the black scholes model  which requires us to estimate the life of the stock option  the volatility of our stock  an appropriate risk free interest rate  and our dividend yield 
the calculation of fair value is highly sensitive to the expected life of the stock option and the volatility of our stock  both of which we estimate based primarily on historical experience 
legal matters we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when we determine that it is probable that a loss has been incurred  the effect is recorded promptly in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation number fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities as early as the first fiscal quarter of certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the effective dates of certain elements of fin have been deferred 
we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
annual results of operations revenue change change dollars in thousands personal computers consumer electronics storage ic products storage systems product revenue percentage of total revenue pts pts development  licensing and royalties percentage of total revenue pts pts total revenue the increase in revenue during is primarily due to increased sales of ce products  which contributed an additional million of revenue  increased sales of storage ic products  which contributed an additional million in revenue  and increased licensing activity  which contributed an additional million of revenue  partially offset by decreased sales of pc products and storage systems products 
the increases in the ce and storage ic products are primarily attributable to our new product offerings  as well as the overall growth in these markets  resulting in increased volumes 
the decrease in demand for our pc products  is attributable to loss of market share due primarily to integration and an overall weakness in the pc market  and the decreased revenue from our storage systems products  resulting from our decision to phase out this product line 
we license our technology in each of our areas of business  but usually limit the scope of the license to market areas that are complementary to our products sales and that do not directly compete with our direct product offerings 
the growth in development  licensing and royalty revenues as a component of total revenues was primarily due to our ability to successfully leverage and create a market for our intellectual property and enter into new licensing agreements and as a result of an increase in our royalty stream  primarily due to a larger licensing base 
the principal reasons for the increase in revenue during relative to were the growth in our pc and ce businesses driven by the increased adoption rates of dvi  a full year s worth of revenue on either new product offerings or products acquired in connection with acquisitions  particularly with respect to fibre channel products and parellel ata and usb controllers  and licensing revenue

although we introduced new products in  many of these new products involved a higher degree of complexity 
the increase in absolute dollars for can be attributed primarily to our acquisition of cmd in june  which increased spending by million in due to the inclusion of months of cmd related expense in  versus only months of expense in additionally  we increased our product development efforts in in order to accelerate our entrance into the storage and ce markets

stock compensation 
stock compensation expense was million or of revenue for  million or of revenue  for  and million or of revenue  for the decrease in total stock compensation expense from to  can be attributed primarily to a decrease in the expense associated with the options granted to employees and assumed in connection with acquisitions  offset by an increase in expense relating to repriced options 
lower average stock price during  and a decline in the number of options subject to variable accounting  as certain older options become fully expensed  contributed to a decrease  which was offset by an increase in our repricing expense as a result of an increase in our stock price in the fourth quarter of the decrease from to can be attributed to use of the accelerated method for recognizing expense for stock options granted to employees and for stock options assumed in connection with acquisitions  which results in a higher proportion of the expense being recognized in earlier periods 
these decreases are partially offset by expense recognized in for options repriced in and  as our average stock price in exceeded the strike price of the repriced options 
we did not recognize expense in in conjunction with our stock option repricings since our average stock price was less than the exercise price of the repriced options 
the following table summarizes the components of our stock compensation expense for  and in thousands 
year ended december  options granted to employees options granted to non employees option repricings options assumed in connection with acquisitions we will incur substantial non cash stock compensation expense in future periods as a result of the issuance of  or modifications to  restricted stock awards and stock option grants to employees and consultants  the stock option repricing programs we implemented in and  and amortization of our existing unearned compensation balance 
since the expense associated with our stock option repricings and stock options issued to consultants is dependent on our stock price and volatility  stock compensation expense may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
to date we have recognized over million of expense in connection with our stock option repricings  and this may become an even more significant component of our stock compensation expense in future periods if our weighted average stock price exceeds  the exercise price of these repriced stock options 
approximately million stock options were outstanding as of december  that were repriced in and basically  the company will incur a non cash charge of million for every dollar increase in the average stock price until these options are exercised 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
during  we recorded million of amortization of intangible assets  compared to million and million of expense for the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  for and  respectively 
the decrease from to is attributable to the lower balance of amortizable intangibles during the decrease from to can be attributed to adoption of a new accounting standard that required companies to no longer amortize goodwill to expense beginning january   and to the impairment charges recorded against intangible assets in and that reduced the carrying value of the assets subject to amortization 
in process research and development 
in process research and development represents technology that has not reached technological feasibility and that has no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
a discussion of our recent acquisitions and in process research and development expense is as follows twn during the quarter ended june   we completed the acquisition of the assets of twn and recorded a one time expense of million for in process research and development 
as of the acquisition date  there was one identified development project that met the necessary criteria polaris 
the value of this project was determined by estimating the future cash flows from the time it was expected to be commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows to present value  and applying a percentage of completion to the calculated values 
the net cash flows from the identified project were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes 
revenue for polaris is expected to commence in and extend through we based our revenue projections on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
the discount rate used for this project was  which we believe is appropriate based on the risk associated with technology that is not yet commercially feasible 
the percentage of completion for this project was based on research and development expenses incurred immediately prior to the acquisition as a percentage of the total estimated research and development expenses required to bring this project to technological feasibility 
as of the date of the acquisition  we estimated that polaris was complete  with total projected costs of approximately  the project was not completed as of december  cmd during the quarter ended june   we recorded a one time operating expense of million for in process research and development incurred in connection with the acquisition of cmd 
as of the acquisition date  there were four identified development projects that met the necessary criteria titan u  titan 
next  sanbox and ide ultra the value of these projects was determined by estimating their future cash flows from the time they were expected to become commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows to their present value  and applying a percentage of completion to the calculated values 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes 
these estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a result of the acquisition  and were in line with industry averages and growth estimates for the storage and semiconductor industries 
revenue for titan u was expected to commence in the fourth quarter of and to extend through revenue for ide ultra was expected to commence in the fourth quarter of and extend through  and revenue for both titan 
next and sanbox was expected to commence in and extend through we based our revenue projections on estimates of market size and growth  expected trends in technology and the expected timing of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
the discount rate used for all projects was  a rate that is consistent with the estimated rates of return on our intangible assets 
this rate is higher than the industry weighted average cost of capital because of the risks associated with the inherent uncertainties of the successful development of the in process research and development  market acceptance of the technology  the useful life of the technology  the profitability level of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined based on research and development expenses incurred immediately prior to the acquisition as a percentage of total estimated research and development expenses to bring each project to technological feasibility 
as of june   we estimated that titan u was complete with total projected costs of  that titan 
next was complete with total projected costs of  that sanbox was complete with total projected costs of  and that ide ultra was complete with total projected costs of  consistent with our projections  revenue related to titan u and ide ultra commenced in the fourth of quarter of development of titan 
next and sanbox was not completed 
we expect to make future acquisitions if advisable and may record additional expenses for in process research and development in connection with those acquisitions 
given the uncertainties of the commercialization process  we cannot assure you that deviations from our estimates will not occur 
we believe there is a reasonable chance of realizing the economic return expected from the acquired in process technology 
however  there is a risk associated with the realization of benefits related to commercialization of an in process project due to rapidly changing customer needs  complexity of technology and growing competitive pressures 
therefore  we cannot assure you that any project will achieve commercial success 
failure to successfully commercialize an in process project would result in the loss of the expected economic return inherent in the fair value allocation 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
in  we recorded million of expense for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of cmd in these assets became impaired as a result of our decision in the second quarter of to transition to a licensing model for our storage subsystem board products  whereby instead of developing  manufacturing and selling board products  we will develop and license board designs in exchange for license fees and royalties 
for  we recorded million of expense for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions of dvdo and cmd 
dvdo goodwill and intangible assets became impaired primarily as a result of our decision to phase out or de emphasize certain existing digital video processing products and to cease funding of certain digital video processing development projects 
additionally  prevailing economic and industry conditions and the departure of certain key dvdo employees during the quarter ended september  also contributed to the impairment expense of million 
we recorded impairment expense of million in the fourth quarter of related to goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with our cmd acquisition 
this impairment resulted from a decrease in our initial estimate of future revenue from cmd s products 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
based on our annual impairment test performed for  in accordance with sfas no  we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal the impairment analysis was based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows as well as our market capitalization at that time 
restructuring 
during the third quarter of  we began a program to focus our business on products and technology  including those obtained through acquisitions  in which we have  or believe we can achieve  a market leadership position 
as part of this program  we decided to cancel numerous products under development  to remove certain projects from our development plan  to phase out or de emphasize certain existing products and to integrate the operations of two acquired companies cmd technology cmd and silicon communication lab scl 
in connection with this program  we reduced our workforce in the fourth quarter of by approximately people  or 
this workforce reduction was the initial step in eliminating duplicate positions that resulted from our acquisitions  and also represented the elimination of other positions based on our new product and technology focus 
positions were eliminated from all functional areas operations  r d and sg a 
because of this workforce reduction  we recorded a restructuring expense of million in the fourth quarter of  consisting of cash severance related costs of  non cash severance related costs of  representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options  an expected loss on leased facilities of  and fixed asset write downs of  in addition  we reversed  of unearned compensation  a component of stockholders equity  for unvested stock options that were cancelled in connection with employee terminations 
in the first quarter of  we implemented a second workforce reduction in connection with the program discussed above  eliminating an additional positions  or of our workforce 
positions were eliminated from all functional areas 
this reduction resulted from the continued integration of acquired companies  as well as continued execution of our product and technology strategy  whereby we decided to phase out the legacy storage subsystem board products we acquired from cmd and to develop new board products only if we believed it would facilitate or accelerate the use of our storage semiconductor products 
in connection with this workforce reduction  we recorded a restructuring expense of million in the first quarter of  consisting of cash severance related costs of  non cash severance related costs of  representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options  an expected loss on leased facilities of million and fixed asset write downs of  for assets to be disposed of 
in addition  we reversed  of unearned compensation  a component of stockholders equity  for unvested stock options that were cancelled in connection with employee terminations 
in april  we decided to transition to a licensing model for our storage subsystem board products  whereby instead of developing  manufacturing and selling board products to facilitate or accelerate the use of our storage semiconductor products  we would develop and license board designs in exchange for license fees  royalties and the use of our semiconductor products 
in connection with this decision  we implemented a third workforce reduction  eliminating positions  or of our workforce  and recorded a restructuring expense of million  consisting of cash severance related costs of  non cash severance related costs of million representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options and fixed asset write downs of million for assets to be disposed of 
we also reversed  of unearned compensation  a component of stockholders equity  for unvested stock options that were cancelled in connection with employee terminations 
in connection with our decision to stop selling board products and to transition to a licensing model  we assessed recoverability of our intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
during the quarter ended september   an impairment expense of  was recognized for acquired technology and  was recognized for patent and other intangible assets  based upon our projection of significantly reduced future cash flows 
additionally  we reduced our estimate of the useful lives of the remaining intangible assets subject to amortization such that these assets were fully amortized by the end of we also tested the carrying value of goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of our impairment test  a goodwill impairment expense of million was recognized during the second quarter of to determine the amount of the impairment  we estimated the fair value of our storage systems business based primarily on expected future cash flows 
we then reduced this amount by the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill also based primarily on expected future cash flows  and compared the unallocated fair value of the business to the carrying value of goodwill 
to the extent goodwill exceeded the unallocated fair value of the business  an impairment expense was recognized 
in december  we revised our estimate of the loss we expect to incur on subleased facilities and recorded a restructuring expense of million 
real estate market conditions deteriorated in the fourth quarter of  causing us to reassess the length of time it would take to find tenants and the fair value lease rate of our available space 
as of december   our expected loss on subleased facilities was based on estimated sublease income of approximately million over the remaining lease terms 
to the extent we are unable to generate million of sublease income  our future results of operations and financial condition will be negatively affected 
in march  we reorganized parts of the marketing and product engineering activities of the company into lines of business for pc  ce and storage products to enable us to better manage our long term growth potential the central engineering  sales  manufacturing  and general and administrative activities were not organized into the line of business structure 
in connection with this reorganization  we reduced our workforce by people  or approximately 
these reductions were primarily in engineering and operations functions 
because of this workforce reduction  we recorded restructuring expense of million in the first quarter of  consisting of cash severance related costs of  and non cash severance related costs of  representing the intrinsic value of modified stock options 
severance related costs were determined based on the amount of pay people received that was not for services performed and by measuring the intrinsic value of stock options that were modified to the benefit of terminated employees 
for those employees terminated in the three month period ending march   the remaining service period from the communication date did not exceed days 
the expected loss on leased facilities resulted from our plan to consolidate our remaining workforce to the extent practicable and sublease any excess space 
to determine the expected loss  we compared our lease and operating costs for the space to our estimate of the net amount we would be able to recover by subleasing the space 
this estimate was based on a number of assumptions  including the length of time it will take to secure a tenant  the sublease rate per square foot  the cost of necessary improvements or modifications and real estate broker commissions 
the fixed asset write downs in and were determined based on the estimated fair value of assets  primarily computer hardware and software that would no longer be utilized after the employees termination dates 
severance and benefits payments are substantially complete 
lease payments will be made in the form of cash through the end of the related lease term of november the following table presents restructuring activity for through december  in thousands severance and benefits leased facilities fixed assets total provision cash payments non cash activity balance as of december  provision cash payments non cash activity balance as of december  provision cash payments non cash activity balance as of december  patent defense and acquisition integration costs 
patent defense and acquisition integration costs were million for  million for and million for patent defense costs are related to the lawsuit we filed against genesis in april  and acquisition integration costs represent costs incurred to integrate cmd and scl 
the increase in can be attributed to discovery  motions  depositions and other activities in preparation for trial in connection with the genesis litigation 
we expect to incur significant patent defense costs through at least the fourth quarter of the amount of legal fees incurred in will depend on the duration of the litigation  as well as the nature and extent of the litigation activities 
we are not able to accurately estimate the amount of legal fees we will incur 
interest income 
interest income was  for  million for  and million for the declines in and can be attributed primarily to declining interest rates and decreasing average cash and investment balances 
interest expense and other net 
net interest expense and other was  for   for and  for the decrease in and can be attributed to decreasing average outstanding debt balances during and provision for income taxes 
due to our losses in  and  no provision for income taxes was recorded in any of those years 
at december   we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expires in various years through these future tax benefits have not been recognized as an asset on our balance sheet due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize these tax benefits 
under the tax reform act of  the amounts of  and benefits from  net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted or limited in certain circumstances 
we do not expect to be subject to these restrictions or limitations 
gain on escrow settlement  net

increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and other assets  and decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities used million in cash  offset by an increase in deferred margin on sales to distributors of million 
net accounts receivable increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily due to increased sales volume  offset by the effect of the timing of the receivables  as revenues levels were higher in the earlier half of the fourth quarter of and the effect of improved collections 
net accounts receivable increased by million at december  compared to december  the increase is attributable primarily to the increase in business volume 
the days of sales outstanding dso was days at december   compared to days at the end of december  the decrease in the dso days is primarily due to improved linearity of revenue shipments  improved collections and a reduction in the december versus september distributor shipments 
inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is attributable primarily to increased business volume during the year and to support future projected revenue activity 
inventories increased by  at december  compared to december  our inventory turn rate decreased to as at december  from as at december  inventory turns are computed on an annualized basis  using the fourth quarter results  and are a measure of the number of times inventory is replenished during the year 
our inventory turns decreased primarily due to higher inventory balances as at december  we expect this measure to remain basically flat during the first quarter of accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased to million and million  respectively  at december  from million and million  respectively  at december  the decrease in accounts payable was due to our stronger cash flow position and the timing of when payables became due  and the decrease in accrued liabilities is primarily due to a decrease in restructuring accruals 
deferred margin on sales to distributors increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is principally due to the effect of increased distributor related shipments at december  compared to december  there was no significant movement in the balance at december  compared to december  investing and financing activities we used million of cash in our investing activities in we used million towards the purchase of property and equipment including the purchase of a new enterprise resource planning system and used million towards the net purchases of short term investments 
we generated million of cash from investing activities in and generated million of cash from investing activities in net proceeds from sales and purchases of short term investments generated million of cash in during  we used million for purchases of property and equipment  primarily software tools for use in r d activities 
during  we received net proceeds from sales and purchases of short term investments of million  and used million of cash for acquisition costs and million of cash for purchases of property and equipment 
we generated million from financing activities in this primarily included million in proceeds received from issuances of common stock  offset by million representing repayment of debt 
we generated million of cash from financing activities in and used million of cash for financing activities in during  we received million of proceeds from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock purchase plans  and our net borrowing activities  including releases of security deposits and debt repayments  used million of cash during cash used by financing activities in was from security deposits on lease financing and debt payments  partially offset by cash provided by issuances of common stock for stock option exercises and stock purchase plan sales 
debt and lease obligations in october  we entered into a million term loan to refinance million of debt acquired in connection with our acquisition of cmd and  of other bank debt 
this loan bears interest at prime at december  plus and requires monthly payments through its maturity of october  during the three months ended march   we borrowed  to finance certain capital equipment 
this term loan bears interest at and requires monthly payments through its maturity in february as of december    was outstanding under these term loans 
our debt facilities contain certain quarterly and annual financial covenants with which we must comply 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we fell out of compliance with the lending institution s quarterly covenants regarding providing periodic financial statements 
we were granted a waiver from the lending institution and were not in default of the loan agreement 
due to the nature of the underlying covenants  we have classified all amounts outstanding as current liabilities as of december  subsequent to december   we entered into an agreement to extend this debt facility by way of a revolving line of credit with an availability of up to million  and an equipment line of credit of up to million 
borrowings under the revolving line are limited to the lesser of million or of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the loan agreement 
this revolving line of credit expires in march and bears interest at either prime plus or libor plus  at our option 
equipment advances pursuant to the equipment line of credit are available to us through august and will be repayable in twenty four equal monthly installments commencing september  bearing interest at either prime or libor plus  at our option 
quarterly and annual financial covenants are contained within this revised agreement 
in october  we financed a  insurance premium at an interest rate of 
monthly payments of  were due through june this was repaid in full during we leased certain software and equipment under lease agreements accounted for as capital leases 
all such leases matured during in october  we entered into a non cancelable operating lease through july for our principal operating facility 
this lease requires average monthly rental payments of approximately  and was secured by a certificate of deposit in the amount of  which was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet 
under the terms of the original lease agreement  this security requirement was not required after july and therefore we no longer maintain a certificate of deposit 
in december  we entered into a non cancelable operating lease renewal for our principal operating facility  including an additional  square feet of space in an adjacent building  that commenced in august and expires in july the lease requires initial average monthly rental payments of  and provides for annual rent increases thereafter 
in june  in connection with our acquisition of cmd  we acquired the lease of an operating facility in irvine  california with average monthly rental payments of approximately  through november we have subleased parts of this facility to three separate third parties 
two of these sublease agreements are coterminous leases and extend through november  while the other sublease is on a month to month basis 
these subleases collectively generate monthly sublease income of approximately  to offset our payment obligations 
additionally  in connection with our acquisition of scl in july  we acquired the lease of a facility in milpitas  california with average monthly rental payments of approximately  per month 
we do not occupy the milpitas facility and are attempting to sublease the space 
we also lease office space in taiwan and japan 
rent expense  net of sublease income  totaled   and  in  and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under operating leases have not been reduced by expected sublease rental income or by the amount of our restructuring accrual that relates to leased facilities 
future minimum payments for our operating leases  debt and inventory related purchase obligations outstanding at december  are as follows in thousands payments due in contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations total we plan to spend approximately million during the next months for equipment  furniture and software 
based on our estimated cash flows for  we believe our existing cash and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next months 
our future operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we generate product revenue and related margins  the timing and extent of development  licensing and royalty revenues  investments in inventory and accounts receivable  the cost of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  our operating expenses  including legal and patent defense costs  and general economic conditions 
in addition  cash may be required for future acquisitions should we choose to pursue any 
to the extent existing resources and cash from operations are insufficient to support our activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
these funds may not be available  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
factors affecting future results you should carefully consider the following risk factors  together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this filing  before you decide to purchase shares of our common stock 
these factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by forward looking statements made by us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we operate in rapidly evolving markets  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
the revenue and income potential of our business and the markets we serve is unproven 
the digital visual interface dvi specification  which is based on technology developed by us and used in many of our products  was first published in april we completed our first generation of consumer electronics and storage ic products in mid to late in addition  the preliminary serial ata specification was first published in august and the high definition multimedia interface hdmi specification was first released in december accordingly  we face risks and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
if we do not successfully address these risks and difficulties  our results of operations could be negatively affected 
we have a history of losses and may not become profitable 
we have incurred net losses in each fiscal year since our inception  including net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we may not achieve and sustain profitability 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
these factors include  but are not limited to the growth  evolution and rate of adoption of industry standards for our key markets  including digital ready pcs and displays  consumer electronics and storage devices  the fact that our licensing revenue is heavily dependent on a few key deals being completed for any given period  the timing of which is not always predictable and is especially susceptible to delay beyond the period in which completion is expected  and our concentrated dependence on a few licensees in any period for substantial portions of our expected licensing revenue  competitive pressures  such as the ability of competitors to successfully introduce products that are more cost effective or that offer greater functionality than our products  including by integrating into their products functionality offered by our products  and the prices set by competitors for their products  and the potential for alliances  combinations  mergers and acquisitions among our competitors  average selling prices of our products  which are influenced by competition and technological advancements  among other factors  government regulations regarding the timing and extent to which digital content must be made available to consumers  the availability of other semiconductors or other key components that are required to produce a complete solution for the customer  usually  we supply one of many necessary components  the cost of components for our products and prices charged by the third parties who manufacture  assemble and test our products  fluctuations in the price of our common stock  which drive a substantial portion of our non cash stock compensation expense  the nature and extent of litigation activities  particularly our patent infringement suit against genesis  and any subsequent legal proceedings related to the matters raised in that suit  and 
any legal matters resulting from the recent audit committee examination  in particular the shareholder and derivative lawsuits against the company and its directors and some of its officers 
because we have little or no control over these factorsand or their magnitude  our operating results are difficult to predict 
any substantial adverse change in any of these factors could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
our future quarterly operating results are highly dependent upon how well we manage our business 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate based on how well we manage our business 
some of the factors that may affect how well we manage our business include the following our ability to manage product introductions and transitions  our ability to successfully manage our business in multiple markets such as pc  storage and ce  our ability to close licensing deals and timely make deliverables and milestones on which recognition of revenue often depends  our ability to engineer customer solutions that adhere to industry standards in a timely  cost effective manner  our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and develop automated test programs within a reasonable time frame for our new products  our ability to manage joint projects  design services  and our supply chain partners  our ability to monitor the activities of our licensees to ensure compliance with license restrictions and remittance of royalties  our ability to structure our organization to enable achievement of our operating objectives and to meet the needs of our customers and markets  the success of the distribution channels through which we choose to sell our products  and our ability to manage expense and inventory levels 
if we fail to effectively manage our business  this could adversely affect our results of operations 
the licensing component of our business strategy increases business risk and volatility 
part of our business strategy is to license certain of our technology to companies that address markets in which we do not want to directly participate 
we have limited experience marketing and selling our technology on a licensing basis 
in conjunction with the business strategy we adopted in late  we signed our first license contract in december  and have signed others since then 
there can be no assurance that additional companies will be interested in licensing our technology on commercially favorable terms or at all 
we also cannot ensure that companies who license our technology will introduce and sell products incorporating our technology  will accurately report royalties owed to us  will pay agreed upon royalties  will honor agreed upon market restrictions  will not infringe upon or misappropriate our intellectual property and will maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information 
licensing contracts are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items  and customer acceptances 
many of these factors require significant judgments 
licensing revenues could fluctuate significantly from period to period because it is heavily dependent on a few key deals being completed in a particular period  the timing of which is difficult to predict 
because of their high margin content  licensing revenues can have a disproportionate impact on gross margins and profitability 
also  generating revenue from licensing arrangements is a lengthy and complex process that may last beyond the period in which efforts begin  and once an agreement is in place  the timing of revenue recognition may be dependent on customer acceptance of deliverables  achievement of milestones  our ability to track and report progress on contracts  customer commercialization of the licensed technology  and other factors 
in addition  in any period  our expectation of licensing revenue is or may be dependent on one or a few licenses being completed 
licensing that occurs in the course of actual or contemplated litigation is subject to risk that the adversarial nature of the transaction will induce non compliance or non payment 
the accounting rules associated with recognizing revenue from licensing transactions are increasingly complex and subject to interpretation 
due to these factors  the amount of license revenue recognized in any period may differ significantly from our expectations 
we face additional risks and costs as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and our recent audit committee examination 
as a result of the delayed filing of our form q for the quarter ended september   and the audit committee s examination  we have experienced additional risks and costs 
the audit committee s examination has been time consuming  required us to incur additional expenses and has affected management s attention and resources 
further  the measures to strengthen internal controls being implemented may require greater management time and company resources to implement and monitor 
we incurred approximately million of costs associated with the audit committee examination in the fourth quarter of and will incur additional costs associated with this examination in the first quarter of we estimate that the costs associated with conduct of the audit committee examination to be approximately million during the first quarter of pending litigation costs associated with the examination cannot be accurately projected for the following quarters and could be significant 
in addition  measures being implemented as a result of this examination  which are described under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations audit committee examination  may adversely affect our operations 
further  certain of our officers and directors have been named as defendants in shareholder derivative litigation  which alleges  among other matters  that as a result of the examination  we will be required to restate our financial results for and and that such a restatement would be due to breaches by the individual defendants of the fiduciary duties to us 
in addition  we and certain of our officers and directors have been named as defendants in securities class action litigation  which alleges that we had materially overstated our licensing revenue  net income and financial results during the time period from april  to november  although the audit committee has completed its examination and concluded that no changes to our financial statements or the results previously announced for the quarter ended september   are required  these lawsuits may be amended or continued  or new suits may be brought in connection with the delayed filing of the form q or the audit committee s examination 
such litigations could be time consuming  require us to incur significant expenses and could divert our management s attention and resources 
in addition  any unfavorable outcome of any of such litigation could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we have been informed by the nasdaq staff that the continued listing of our common stock is conditioned on our timely filing of all periodic reports under the securities exchange act of  such as our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  and current reports on form k  for all reporting periods ending on or before december  should we fail to timely make any such filing  nasdaq has informed us that we will not be entitled to a new hearing with the nasdaq staff and our common stock may be transferred to the nasdaq smallcap market  provided we could demonstrate compliance with applicable maintenance criteria for such market and an ability to sustain long term compliance  or immediately delisted from the nasdaq national market 
the nasdaq staff has reserved the right to reconsider the terms of the foregoing exception permitting continued listing of our common stock upon a review of our publicly filed financial statements or if any event  condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would  in the opinion of the staff  make continued listing of our stock inadvisable or unwarranted 
finally  as a result of our delayed filing of our form q  we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by others until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the securities exchange act of for one year 
the company may use form s to raise capital or complete acquisitions  which could increase transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies during this period 
we face intense competition in our markets  which may lead to reduced revenue from sales of our products and increased losses 
the pc  ce and storage markets in which we operate are intensely competitive 
these markets are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards  short product life cycles and declining selling prices 
our display products face competition from a number of sources  including analog solutions  dvi based solutions  dual analog and dvi based solutions and other digital interface solutions 
we expect competition in the display market to increase 
for example  analog devices  ati  broadcom  chrontel  genesis microchip  matrox  national semiconductor  novatek  nvidia  phillips  pixelworks  sis  smart asic  st microelectronics  sunplus  texas instruments  thine  and weltrend  are shipping products or have announced intentions to introduce products and or other digital interface solutions that we expect will compete with our panellink products 
other companies have announced dvi based solutions and we expect that additional companies are likely to enter the market 
current or potential customers  including our own licensees  may also develop solutions that could compete with us  directly or indirectly  such as the integration of a dvi transmitter into a graphics processing unit or integration of a dvi receiver into a monitor controller 
in the ce market  our digital interface products are used to connect cable set top boxes  satellite set top boxes and dvd players to digital televisions 
these products incorporate dvi and high bandwidth digital content protection hdcp  or hdmi with or without hdcp support 
companies that have announced or are shipping dvi hdcp solutions include texas instruments ti  thine  broadcom and genesis microchip genesis 
in addition  our video processing products face competition from products sold by av science  broadcom  focus enhancements  genesis  mediamatics  micronas semiconductor  oplus  philips  pixelworks and trident 
we also compete  in some instances  against in house processing solutions designed by large original equipment manufacturers 
we expect competition for hdmi products from the other hdmi founders and adopters  including hitachi  matsushita  philips  sony  thomson and toshiba 
in the storage market  our fibre channel products face competition from companies selling similar discrete products  including agilent  pmc sierra and vitesse  from other fibre channel serializer deserializer serdes providers who license their core technology  such as lsi logic  and from companies that sell host bust adapters hba controllers with integrated serdes  such as qlogic and agilent 
in the future  our current or potential customers may also develop their own proprietary solutions that may include integration of serdes 
our serial ata products compete with similar products from marvell and promise 
in addition  other companies such as adaptec  apt  ati  intel  lsi logic  serverworks and vitesse  have developed or announced intentions to develop serial ata controllers 
we also compete against intel and other motherboard chipset makers that have integrated serial ata functionality into their chipsets 
our parallel ata products compete with similar products from promise and highpoint 
our raid controller board products face competition from mylex  infortrend  and chaparral 
some of these competitors have already established supplier or joint development relationships with current or potential customers and may be able to leverage their existing relationships to discourage these customers from purchasing products from us or persuade them to replace our storage products with theirs 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater presence in key markets  better name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
in addition  some of our competitors could merge for example  genesis and pixelworks announced  and then terminated  such a merger  which may enhance their market presence 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements  or devote more resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
we cannot assure you that we can compete successfully against current or potential competitors  or that competition will not reduce our revenue and increase our losses 
growth of the market for our pc products depends on the widespread adoption and use of the dvi specification 
our success is largely dependent upon the rapid and widespread adoption of the dvi specification  which defines a high speed data communication link between computers and digital displays 
we cannot predict the rate at which manufacturers of computers and digital displays will adopt the dvi specification 
to date  relatively few systems implementing all of the electrical and mechanical aspects of the dvi specification have been shipped 
the dvi adoption rate in the pc market was reported to be approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the dvi adoption rate is estimated to be in the range of 
adoption of the dvi specification may be affected by the availability of computer components able to communicate dvi compliant signals  such as transmitters  receivers  connectors and cables necessary to implement the specification 
other specifications may also emerge that could adversely affect the acceptance of the dvi specification 
for example  a number of companies have promoted alternatives to the dvi specification using other interface technologies  such as low voltage differential signaling  or lvds 
further delays in the widespread adoption of the dvi specification could reduce acceptance of our products  limit or reduce our revenue growth and increase our losses 
our success depends on the growth of the digital display market 
our pc business depends on the growth of the digital display market 
the potential size of the digital display market and its rate of development are uncertain and will depend on many factors  including the number of digital ready computers that are being produced and consumer demand for these computers  the rate at which display manufacturers replace analog or non compliant dvi interfaces with fully dvi compliant interfaces  the availability of cost effective semiconductors that implement a fully dvi compliant interface  and improvements to analog technology  which may decrease consumer demand for our digital display products 
in order for the digital display market to grow  digital displays must be widely available and affordable to consumers 
in the past  the supply of digital displays  such as flat panels  has been cyclical and consumers have been very price sensitive 
also  some manufacturers have implemented dvi interfaces that are not fully dvi compliant 
these interfaces often interfere with the operability of our products which function best with a fully dvi compliant interface 
our ability to sustain or increase our revenue may be limited should there not be an adequate supply of  or demand for  affordable digital displays with fully dvi compliant interfaces 
a significant amount of our revenue is associated with the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry 
the pc industry has slowed and the adoption of these new technologies may not occur as planned 
a large portion of our revenue is directly or indirectly related to the pc industry and the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry 
accordingly  we are highly dependent on the adoption of new or emerging technologies within the pc industry  which experienced a slowdown in growth during the second half of that has continued through we cannot predict the duration or severity of the downturn in the pc and display market  or in the general economy  or its effect on our revenue and operating results  including the adoption of these new or emerging technologies 
if the market for pcs and pc related displays continues to grow at a slow rate or contracts whether due to reduced demand from end users  macroeconomic conditions or other factors  our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
although we are attempting to broaden our product offerings to include more products for the consumer electronics and storage markets  there can be no guarantee that we will succeed in this effort 
to date  we have achieved reasonable success  but if we fail to consistently achieve design wins in the consumer electronics and storage markets  we will remain highly dependent on the pc industry 
demand for our consumer electronics products is dependent on the adoption and widespread use of the hdmi specification 
our success in the consumer electronics market is largely dependent upon the rapid and widespread adoption of the hdmi specification  which combines high definition video and multi channel audio in one digital interface and uses our patented underlying transition minimized differential signaling tmds technology  and optionally intel s hdcp technology  as the basis for the interface 
version of the specification was published for adoption on december  we cannot predict the rate at which manufacturers will adopt the hdmi specification or if the specification will be adopted at all 
adoption of the hdmi specification may be affected by the availability of consumer products  such as dvd players and televisions  and of computer components that implement this new interface 
other competing specifications may also emerge that could adversely affect the acceptance of the hdmi specification 
delays in the widespread adoption of the hdmi specification could reduce acceptance of our products  limit or reduce our revenue growth and increase our losses 
we believe that the adoption of our ce products may be affected in part by us and international regulations relating to digital television  cable  satellite and over the air digital transmissions  specifically regulations relating to the transition from analog to digital television 
the federal communications commission fcc has adopted rules governing the transition from analog to digital television  which include rules governing the requirements for television sets sold in the united states designed to speed the transition to digital television 
the fcc has delayed such requirements and timetables for phasing in digital television in the past 
we cannot predict whether the fcc will further delay its rules relating to the digital television requirements and timetables 
in the event that additional regulatory activity  either in the united states or internationally  delay or postpone the transition to digital television beyond the anticipated time frame  that could reduce the demand for our ce products 
in addition  we believe that the rate of hdmi adoption may be accelerated by the proposed fcc rules requiring that all high definition set top boxes distributed by cable operators include a dvi or hdmi interface and that all ce products marketed or labeled as digital cable ready include a dvi or hdmi interface 
however  we cannot predict whether the proposed rules will be adopted in their current form or when any final rules will be put into effect 
in the event that mandatory use of a dvi or hdmi interface were to be delayed beyond the currently anticipated time frame or not required at all  that could reduce the demand for our ce products  which would adversely affect our business 
our ability to increase sales of our products for display systems depends on host system manufacturers including dvi compliant transmitters in their systems 
our success in the pc market depends on increasing sales of our receiver products to display manufacturers 
to increase sales of our receiver products  we need computer manufacturers to incorporate dvi compliant transmitters in their systems  making these systems digital ready 
during  we introduced a low cost add in card that can be used in conjunction with intel s g chip set to provide an all digital connection to flat panels 
intel s g chip set is intended to provide an all digital path on the motherboard bus  and should make it easier to provide digital video out 
use of intel s g chip set  or any digital path chip set  is not universal and may not gain market acceptance 
if computers are not digital ready  they will not operate with digital displays  which will limit and may reduce the demand for our digital host and receiver products 
our success depends on the development and growth of markets for products based on new and emerging storage technologies 
our product development efforts in the storage market are focused on the development of products using new interface technologies such as fibre channel and serial ata 
the markets for these new interface technologies are at an early stage of development  and there can be no assurance that they will replace other storage interfaces that are now widely used  such as parallel ata and scsi 
the potential size and rate of development of these markets are uncertain and will depend on many factors  including the rate at which manufacturers of storage subsystems adopt new interface technologies  which may be more costly to implement than existing interface technologies until volumes are sufficient to bring costs to competitive levels  the availability of cost effective semiconductors and components for storage subsystems  such as serial ata enabled hard drives and serial ata enabled optical drives cd and dvd  that implement new interface technologies for the storage market  whether intel or other motherboard manufacturers integrate the functionality of our products  such as serial ata  into their chips and chip sets  and improvement to existing storage interface technologies such as parallel ata and scsi  or the introduction of other new storage interface technologies  either of which may decrease consumer demand for our storage products 
in particular  the rate of implementation of the serial ata interface will depend on how quickly drive manufacturers  motherboard and pc providers and chipmakers are able to resolve technical communication and functionality issues to enable a plug and play environment in which a computer system is automatically able to recognize and configure storage devices 
resolution of these issues could be time consuming  and will depend in good measure on the ability of chipmakers to incorporate the required high speed serial data transfer capabilities into their semiconductors without sacrificing manufacturing yields 
any delay in acceptance of new interface technologies  or a reduction in the growth or size of the market for systems based on serial ata or fibre channel technologies  would limit sales of our storage products and reduce our revenue 
any delay in the availability of serial ata compatible drives or acceleration of serial ata or fibre channel serdes integration efforts by motherboard or storage controller manufacturers may also reduce our revenue 
we have promulgated a satalite specification to which we have invited key industry members to participate 
this program includes certain licenses to our technology that we hope will increase market acceptance of our serial ata products 
there can be no assurance that this program will succeed  or that satalite participants will not use our technology to compete against us 
to date  we have achieved a number of design wins for our serial ata and fibre channel storage products 
even after we have achieved a design win from an original equipment manufacturer oem  we may not realize any revenue  or significant revenue  from that oem since a design win is not a binding commitment to purchase our products and the oem may not achieve market acceptance for their product 
further delay in serial ata enabled drive availability may lead oems to re open their designs and designs we have won may be subject to being lost  which could reduce our revenue and increase our operating expenses in competing to re win designs 
we do not have long term commitments from our customers and we allocate resources based on our estimates of customer demand 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders  rather than long term agreements 
in addition  our customers may cancel or reschedule purchase orders 
we purchase inventory components and build our products according to our estimates of customer demand 
this process requires us to make multiple assumptions  including volume and timing of customer demand for each product  manufacturing yields and product quality 
if we overestimate customer demand or product quality or under estimate manufacturing yields  we may build products that we may not be able to sell at an acceptable price or at all 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would increase our losses 
additionally  if we underestimate customer demand or if sufficient manufacturing capacity is unavailable  we will forego revenue opportunities or incur significant costs for rapid increases in production  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
our lengthy sales cycle can result in a delay between incurring expenses and generating revenue  which could harm our operating results 
because our products are based on new technology and standards  a lengthy sales process  typically requiring several months or more  is often required before potential customers begin the technical evaluation of our products 
this technical evaluation can exceed nine months before the potential customer informs us whether we have achieved a design win  which is not a binding commitment to purchase our products 
after achieving a design win  it can then be an additional nine months before a customer commences volume shipments of systems incorporating our products  if at all 
given our lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between the time we incur expenditures and the time we generate revenue  if any 
as a result  our operating results could be seriously harmed if a significant customer reduces or delays orders  or chooses not to release products incorporating our products 
we depend on a few key customers and the loss of any of them could significantly reduce our revenue 
historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for the year ended  shipments to world peace international  an asian distributor  generated of our revenue  and shipments to weikeng  a distributor  generated of our revenue 
for the year ended december   shipments to world peace international generated of our revenue  and shipments to weikeng generated of our revenue 
in addition  an end customer may buy through multiple distributors  contract manufacturers  and or directly  which could create an even greater concentration 
we cannot be certain that customers and key distributors that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  will continue to sell our products and generate revenue 
as a result of this concentration of our customers  our results of operations could be negatively affected if any of the following occurs one or more of our customers  including distributors  becomes insolvent or goes out of business  one or more of our key customers or distributors significantly reduces  delays or cancels orders  or one or more significant customers selects products manufactured by one of our competitors for inclusion in their future product generations 
due to our participation in multiple markets  our customer base has broadened significantly and we therefore anticipate being less dependent on a relatively small number of customers to generate revenue 
however  as product mix fluctuates from quarter to quarter  we may become more dependent on a small number of customers or a single customer for a significant portion of our revenue in a particular quarter  the loss of which could adversely affect our operating results 
we sell our products through distributors  which limits our direct interaction with our customers  therefore reducing our ability to forecast sales and increasing the complexity of our business 
many original equipment manufacturers rely on third party manufacturers or distributors to provide inventory management and purchasing functions 
distributors generated of our revenue for  and of our revenue for the year ended december  selling through distributors reduces our ability to forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business  requiring us to manage a more complex supply chain  monitor and manage the level of inventory of our products at each distributor  estimate the impact of credits  return rights  price protection and unsold inventory at distributors  and monitor the financial condition and credit worthiness of our distributors  many of which are located outside of the united states  and the majority of which are not publicly traded 
any failure to manage these challenges could disrupt or reduce sales of our products and unfavorably impact our financial results 
our success depends on the development and introduction of new products  which we may not be able to do in a timely anner because the process of developing high speed semiconductor products is complex and costly 
the development of new products is highly complex  and we have experienced delays  some of which exceeded one year  in the development and introduction of new products on several occasions in the past 
in and  we announced our first products for the storage market and we expect to introduce new consumer electronics  storage and dvi products in the future 
as our products integrate new  more advanced functions  they become more complex and increasingly difficult to design  manufacture and debug 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including  but not limited to accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  including enhancements to existing standards such as dvi  hdcp and sata  and development and adoption of new or emerging standards such as hdmi  or significant modifications to existing standards such as sata ii  development of advanced technologies and capabilities  and new products that satisfy customer requirements  competitors and customers integration of the functionality of our products into their products  which puts pressure on us to continue to develop and introduce new products with new functionality  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  management of product life cycles  use of leading edge foundry processes and achievement of high manufacturing yields and low cost testing  and market acceptance of new products 
accomplishing all of this is extremely challenging  time consuming and expensive and there is no assurance that we will succeed 
product development delays may result from unanticipated engineering complexities  changing market or competitive product requirements or specifications  difficulties in overcoming resource limitations  the inability to license third party technology or other factors 
competitors and customers may integrate the functionality of our products into their products that would reduce demand for our products 
if we are not able to develop and introduce our products successfully and in a timely manner  our costs could increase or our revenue could decrease  both of which would adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  it is possible that we may experience delays in generating revenue from these products or that we may never generate revenue from these products 
we must work with a semiconductor foundry and with potential customers to complete new product development and to validate manufacturing methods and processes to support volume production and potential re work 
each of these steps may involve unanticipated difficulties  which could delay product introduction and reduce market acceptance of the product 
in addition  these difficulties and the increasing complexity of our products may result in the introduction of products that contain defects or that do not perform as expected  which would harm our relationships with customers and our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve design wins for our planned new products  that we will be able to complete development of these products when anticipated  or that these products can be manufactured in commercial volumes at acceptable yields  or that any design wins will produce any revenue 
failure to develop and introduce new products  successfully and in a timely manner  may adversely affect our results of operations 
we have made acquisitions in the past and may make acquisitions in the future  if advisable  and these acquisitions involve numerous risks 
our growth depends upon market growth and our ability to enhance our existing products and introduce new products on a timely basis 
one of the ways we develop new products and enter new markets is through acquisitions 
in  we completed the acquisitions of zillion and dvdo  and in  we completed the acquisitions of cmd and scl 
in april  we acquired twn 
we may acquire additional companies or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to  the following difficulty and increased costs in assimilating employees  including our possible inability to keep and retain key employees of the acquired business  disruption of our ongoing business  discovery of undisclosed liabilities of the acquired companies and legal disputes with founders or shareholders of acquired companies  inability to successfully incorporate acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies and procedures  inability to commercialize acquired technology  and the need to take impairment charges or write downs with respect to acquired assets 
no assurance can be given that our prior acquisitions or our future acquisitions  if any  will be successful or provide the anticipated benefits  or that they will not adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
failure to manage growth effectively and to successfully integrate acquisitions made by us could materially harm our business and operating results 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may create fluctuations in our foundry  test and assembly capacity 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been characterized by significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
for example  demand in the semiconductor industry rose to record levels in  and then declining until recently when it appears to be recovering 
the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this cyclicality has led to significant fluctuations in product demand and in the foundry  test and assembly capacity of third party suppliers 
production capacity for fabricated semiconductors could be subject to allocation  whereby not all of our production requirements would be met 
this may impact our ability to meet demand and could also increase our production costs 
cyclicality has also accelerated decreases in average selling prices per unit 
we may experience fluctuations in our future financial results because of changes in industry wide conditions 
we depend on third party sub contractors to manufacture  assemble and test nearly all of our products  which reduces our control over the production process 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
we rely on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  an outside foundry  to produce the vast majority all of our semiconductor products 
we also rely on kawasaki  umc and atmel  for outside foundry services  and on amkor and ase to test certain of our semiconductor products 
our reliance on independent foundries  assembly and test facilities involves a number of significant risks  including  but not limited to reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply  lack of availability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies  and our ability to transition to alternate sources if services are unavailable from primary suppliers 
in addition  our semiconductor products are assembled and tested by several independent subcontractors 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with our subcontractors  and instead obtain production services on a purchase order basis 
our outside sub contractors have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period of time  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
our requirements represent a small portion of the total production capacity of our outside foundries  assembly and test facilities and our sub contractors may reallocate capacity to other customers even during periods of high demand for our products 
these foundries may allocate or move production of our products to different foundries under their control  even in different locations  which may be time consuming  costly  and difficult  have an adverse affect on quality  yields  and costs  and require us and or our customers to re qualify the products  which could open up design wins to competition and result in the loss of design wins and design ins 
if our subcontractors are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and costs  and in a timely manner  our business will be substantially harmed 
as a result  we would have to identify and qualify substitute contractors  which would be time consuming  costly and difficult 
this qualification process may also require significant effort by our customers  and may lead to re qualification of parts  opening up design wins to competition  and loss of design wins and design ins 
any of these circumstances could substantially harm our business 
in addition  if competition for foundry  assembly and test capacity increases  our product costs may increase and we may be required to pay significant amounts or make significant purchase commitments to secure access to production services 
the nature of our production process is complex  which reduces identification of problems until well into the production cycle or  in some cases  after the product has been shipped 
the manufacture of semiconductors is a complex process  and it is often difficult for semiconductor foundries to achieve acceptable product yields 
product yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
since low yields may result from either design or process difficulties  identifying problems can often only occur well into the production cycle  when an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested 
further  we only test our products after they are assembled  as their high speed nature makes earlier testing difficult and expensive 
as a result  defects often are not discovered until after assembly 
this could result in a substantial number of defective products being assembled and tested or shipped  thus lowering our yields and increasing our costs 
these risks could result in product shortages or increased costs of assembling  testing or even replacing our products 
although we test our products before shipment  they are complex and may contain defects and errors 
in the past we have encountered defects and errors in our products 
because our products are sometimes integrated with products from other vendors  it can be difficult to identify the source of any particular problem 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems  may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  warranty and product liability claims against us that may not be fully covered by insurance 
any of these circumstances could substantially harm our business 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks because a majority of our products and our customers products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
a substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the united states 
as a result  we are subject to foreign business  political and economic risks 
nearly all of our products are manufactured in taiwan or elsewhere in asia  and for the years ended december    and   and of our revenue respectively was generated from customers and distributors located outside of the united states  primarily in asia 
we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including  but not limited to difficulties in managing from afar  political and economic instability  including international tension in iraq  korea and the china strait and lack of normal diplomatic relationships between the united states and taiwan  less developed infrastructures in newly industrializing countries  susceptibility of foreign areas to terrorist attacks  susceptibility to interruptions of travel  including those due to international tensions including the war in and occupation of iraq  the sars and avian flu epidemics particularly affecting the asian markets we serve  and the financial instability and bankruptcy of major air carriers  bias against foreign  especially american  companies  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  expense and difficulties in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions  difficulties in complying with multiple  conflicting and changing laws and regulations  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties  visa restrictions  environmental laws and other barriers  exposure to possible litigation or claims in foreign jurisdictions  and competition from foreign based suppliers and the existence of protectionist laws and business practices that favor these suppliers  such as withholding taxes on payments made to us 
these risks could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
in addition  original equipment manufacturers that design our semiconductors into their products sell them outside of the united states 
this exposes us indirectly to foreign risks 
because sales of our products are denominated exclusively in united states dollars  relative increases in the value of the united states dollar will increase the foreign currency price equivalent of our products  which could lead to a reduction in sales and profits in that country 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark  mask work and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will protect our technology 
in addition  we do not file patent applications on a worldwide basis  meaning we do not have patent protection in some jurisdictions 
it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents in the united states and in other jurisdictions 
it is also possible that some of our existing or new licensing relationships will enable other parties to use our intellectual property to compete against us 
legal actions to enforce intellectual property rights tend to be lengthy and expensive  and the outcome often is not predictable 
as a result  despite our efforts and expenses  we may be unable to prevent others from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property  which could harm our business 
in addition  practicality also limits our assertion of intellectual property rights 
patent litigation is expensive and its results are often unpredictable 
assertion of intellectual property rights often results in counterclaims for perceived violations of the defendant s intellectual property rights and or antitrust claims 
certain parties after receipt of an assertion of infringement will cut off all commercial relationships with the party making the assertion  thus making assertions against suppliers  customers  and key business partners unwise 
accordingly  if we forgo making such claims  we may risk creating legal and equitable defenses for an infringer 
our participation in the digital display working group requires us to license some of our intellectual property for free  which may make it easier for others to compete with us in the dvi pc market 
we are a promoter of the ddwg  which published and promotes the dvi specification 
our strategy includes establishing the dvi specification as the industry standard  promoting and enhancing this specification and developing and marketing products based on this specification and future enhancements 
as a result we must license for free specific elements of our intellectual property to others for use in implementing the dvi specification  and we may license additional intellectual property for free as the ddwg promotes enhancements to the dvi specification 
accordingly  companies that implement the dvi specification in their products can use specific elements of our intellectual property for free to compete with us 
our participation as a founder in the working group developing hdmi requires us to license some of our intellectual property  which may make it easier for others to compete with us in the market 
in april  together with sony  philips  thomson  toshiba  matsushita and hitachi  we announced the formation of a working group to define the next generation digital interface specification for consumer electronics products 
version of the specification was published for adoption on december  the hdmi specification combines high definition video and multi channel audio in one digital interface and uses silicon image s patented underlying tmds technology  optionally  along with intel s hdcp as the basis for the interface 
the founders of the working group have signed a founder s agreement in which each commits to license certain intellectual property to each other  and to adopters of the specification 
our strategy includes establishing the hdmi specification as the industry standard  promoting and enhancing this specification and developing and marketing products based on this specification and future enhancements 
as a result we must license specific elements of our intellectual property to others for use in implementing the hdmi specification  and we may license additional intellectual property as the hdmi founders group promotes enhancements to the hdmi specification 
accordingly  companies that implement the hdmi specification in their products can use specific elements of our intellectual property to compete with us 
although there will be license fees and royalties associated with the adopters agreements  there can be no assurance that such license fees and royalties will adequately compensate us for having to license our intellectual property 
fees and royalties received during the early years of adoption will be used to cover costs we incur to promote the hdmi standard and to develop and perform interoperability tests  in addition  after an initial period  the hdmi founders may reallocate the license fees and royalties amongst themselves to reflect each founder s relative contribution of intellectual property to the hdmi specification 
our success depends on managing our relationship with intel 
intel has a dominant role in many of the markets in which we compete  such as pcs and storage  and is a growing presence in the ce market 
we have a multi faceted relationship with intel that is complex and requires significant management attention  including intel has been an investor of ours  intel and we have been parties to a business cooperation agreement  intel and we are parties to a patent cross license  intel and we worked together to develop hdcp  an intel subsidiary has the exclusive right to license hdcp  of which we are a licensee  intel and we were two of the original founders of the digital display working group ddwg  intel is a promoter of the serial ata working group  of which we are a contributor  intel is a supplier to us and a customer for our products  we believe that intel has the market presence to drive adoption of dvi and serial ata by making them widely available in its chip sets and motherboards  which could affect demand for our products  we believe that intel has the market presence to affect adoption of hdmi by either endorsing the technology or promulgating a competing standard  which could affect demand for our products  intel may potentially integrate the functionality of our products  including fibre channel  serial ata or dvi  into its own chips and chip sets  thereby displacing demand for some of our products  intel may design new technologies that would require us to re design our products for compatibility  thus increasing our r d expense and reducing our revenue  intel s technology  including its g chip set  may lower barriers to entry to other parties who may enter the market and compete with us  and intel may enter into or continue relationships with our competitors that can put us at a relative disadvantage 
our cooperation and competition with intel can lead to positive benefits if managed effectively 
if our relationship with intel is not managed effectively  it could seriously harm our business  negatively affect our revenue  and increase our operating expenses 
we have granted intel rights with respect to our intellectual property  which could allow intel to develop products that compete with ours or otherwise reduce the value of our intellectual property 
we have entered into a patent cross license agreement with intel in which each of us granted the other a license to use the grantor s patents  except for identified types of products 
we believe that the scope of our license to intel excludes our current products and anticipated future products 
intel could  however  exercise its rights under this agreement to use our patents to develop and market other products that compete with ours  without payment to us 
additionally  intel s rights to our patents could reduce the value of our patents to any third party who otherwise might be interested in acquiring rights to use our patents in such products 
finally  intel could endorse competing products  including a competing digital interface  or develop its own proprietary digital interface 
any of these actions could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we are and may continue to become the target of securities class action suits which could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources 
securities class action suits are often brought against companies  particularly technology companies  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
defending against these suits  even if meritless  can result in substantial costs to us and could divert the attention of our management 
we and certain of our officers and directors  together with certain investment banks  have been named as defendants in a securities class action suit filed against us on behalf of purchasers of our securities between october  and december  it is alleged that the prospectus related to our initial public offering was misleading because it failed to disclose that the underwriters of our initial public offering had solicited and received excessive commissions from certain investors in exchange for agreements by investors to buy our shares in the aftermarket for predetermined prices 
due to inherent uncertainties in litigation  we cannot accurately predict the outcome of this litigation  however  a proposed settlement has been negotiated that has yet to be reviewed and approved by the court 
in the event that the settlement is not approved  we believe that these claims are without merit and we intend to defend vigorously against them 
we and certain of our officers  together with certain investment banks and their current or former employees  were named as defendants in a securities class action suit filed against us on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased stock from some or all of approximately issuers whose public offerings were underwritten by credit suisse first boston 
the lawsuit alleges that silicon image and certain officers were part of a scheme by credit suisse first boston to artificially inflate the price of silicon image s stock through the dissemination of allegedly false analysts reports 
the plaintiff in this matter has filed an amended complaint in which silicon image  and the named officers  were dropped as defendants 
we believe that the settlement described above  if approved  would encompass the claims in this case 
we believe that these claims were without merit and  if revived  and not subject to the settlement  we intend to defend vigorously against them 
certain of our officers and directors have been named as defendants in consolidated shareholder derivative litigation 
the lawsuit alleges that as a result of the examination conducted by our audit committee  we will be required to restate our financial results for and the lawsuit further alleges that such a restatement would be due to breaches by the individual defendants of their fiduciary duties to us  that certain of the individual defendants are liable to us for insider trading under california law  and that the individual defendants are liable to us for mismanagement  abuse of control  and waste 
we and certain of our officers have also been named as defendants in consolidated securities class action litigation 
plaintiffs filed the action on behalf of a putative class of shareholders who purchased our stock between april  and november  the lawsuit alleges that we had materially overstated our licensing revenue  net income and financial results during this time period  and that were being forced to restate our financial results 
with the announcement by the audit committee of silicon image s board of directors that it has completed its examination and that it has concluded that no changes to silicon image s previously announced financial results are required  the preceding two lawsuits may be moot in whole or in part  although plaintiffs may amend the complaint once as a matter of right 
we believe that these claims are without merit and we intend to defend vigorously against them 
however  these suits and any others that may be brought  even if meritless  could require us to incur expenses and could divert our management s attention and resources 
in addition  any unfavorable outcome of either of these litigations could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are currently engaged in intellectual property litigation that is time consuming and expensive to prosecute 
we may become engaged in additional intellectual property litigation that could be time consuming  maybe be expensive to prosecute or defend  and could adversely affect our ability to sell our product 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states and in other jurisdictions involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
this litigation is particularly prevalent in the semiconductor industry  in which a number of companies aggressively use their patent portfolios to bring infringement claims 
in addition  in recent years  there has been an increase in the filing of so called nuisance suits  alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
these claims may be asserted as counterclaims in response to claims made by a company alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
these suits pressure defendants into entering settlement arrangements to quickly dispose of such suits  regardless of merit 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  from time to time we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
as each claim is evaluated  we may consider the desirability of entering into settlement or licensing agreements 
no assurance can be given that settlements will occur or that licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products  or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay damages or royalties to a third party  and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in april  we filed suit against genesis microchip for infringement of one of our us patents 
at that time  we also filed a complaint against genesis for unlawful trade practices related to the importation of articles infringing our patent 
in february  our motion to dismiss the unlawful trade practices complaint was granted and we filed an amended complaint against genesis alleging infringement of two of our us patents 
these patents relate to our dvi receiver products  which generate a significant portion of our revenue 
the amended complaint seeks a declaration that genesis has infringed our patents  that genesis s behavior is not licensed  an injunction to halt the importation  sale  manufacture and use of genesis dvi receiver chips that infringe our patents  and monetary damages 
in april  genesis answered and made counterclaims against us for non infringement  license  patent invalidity  fraud  antitrust  unfair competition and patent misuse 
we filed a motion to dismiss certain of genesis s counterclaims 
in addition  we filed a motion to bifurcate trial of the counterclaims to the extent the court does not dismiss them 
in may  the court granted our motion to dismiss certain of the counterclaims  with leave to amend 
genesis re filed counterclaims against us for fraud and patent misuse 
we filed another motion to dismiss these counterclaims 
in august  the court granted our motion and dismissed genesis s re filed counterclaims with prejudice 
in december  the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding mou to settle the case 
in january  the parties presented different interpretations of the mou to the court 
on july   the court granted our motion to interpret the mou in the manner we requested  and ruled that genesis had engaged in efforts to avoid its obligations under the mou 
on august   the court entered a final judgment order based on its july  ruling 
under the final judgment order  genesis was ordered to make a substantial cash payment  and to make royalty payments  although genesis has made and continues to make cash payments to the court  it may not have made all the payments that are required under the final judgment order 
we filed motions for reimbursement of some of some of expenses  including some of our legal fees  and for modification and or clarification of certain items of the judgment  and to hold genesis in contempt of court for breaching the protective order in the case by disclosing secret information to at least one of our competitors 
on december   the court granted our motions in part and denied them in part the court issued an amended judgment  and held genesis in contempt of court for breaching the protective order 
on january   genesis filed a notice of appeal 
there can be no assurance that genesis will not undertake further efforts to avoid its obligations under the mou  and that further proceedings lawsuits  contempt citations  etc 
against genesis  and certain of its executives  its counsel  and others may not be required to obtain compliance or to obtain redress for non compliance 
there can be no assurance that an appellate court will uphold the court s rulings or the mou 
there can be no assurance that further delays or noncompliance will not occur 
the court s rulings of july  and december  indicate that genesis violated certain provisions of the mou  and of the protective order in the case  including disclosure of confidential information to pixelworks 
on august   genesis and pixelworks issued a joint press release terminating their proposed merger 
in that press release  genesis and pixelworks jointly stated that pixelworks has confirmed that prior to signing the merger agreement  it reviewed the memorandum of understanding that purported to settle the lawsuit between genesis microchip and silicon image  inc while this litigation  including any appeal or any possible derivative proceedings  is pending  genesis can use the technology covered by these patents to develop products that might compete with ours 
if we are unsuccessful in this litigation  we could be unable to prevent genesis or others from using the technology covered by these patents 
even if we prevail in this litigation  uncertainties regarding the outcome prior to that time may reduce demand for our products  or genesis s use of our technology in products that compete with our products may reduce demand or pricing for our products 
in addition  even if the mou is upheld on appeal  future disputes may occur  including those regarding whether and what intellectual property licenses were granted and the scope of any such licenses and the royalty rates and payment terms for such licenses  whether the mou was breached  whether consent was fraudulently obtained  and whether a merger partner may succeed to the rights and or the obligations under the mou 
these disputes may result in additional costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for free 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us could also force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 
if we take any of these actions  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products 
we may be exposed to liability for monetary damages  the extent of which would be very difficult to accurately predict 
in addition  we may be exposed to customer claims  for potential indemnity obligations  and to customer dissatisfaction and a discontinuance of purchases of our products while the litigation is pending 
any of these consequences could substantially harm our business and results of operations 
we have entered into  and may again be required to enter into  patent or other intellectual property cross licenses 
many companies have significant patent portfolios or key specific patents  or other intellectual property in areas in which we compete 
many of these companies appear to have policies of imposing cross licenses on other participants in their markets  which may include areas in which we compete 
as a result  we have been required  either under pressure of litigation or by significant vendors or customers  to enter into cross licenses or non assertion agreements relating to patents or other intellectual property 
this permits the cross licensee  or beneficiary of a non assertion agreement  to use certain or all of our patents and or certain other intellectual property for free to compete with us 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful  and competition for qualified personnel is increasing in our market 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued contributions of our key management  technical and sales personnel  many of who would be difficult to replace 
the loss of one or more of these employees could harm our business 
although we have entered into a limited number of employment contracts with certain executive officers  we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees 
we do not have key person life insurance for any of our key personnel 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing  finance and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry and in our location 
this makes it difficult to retain our key personnel and to recruit highly qualified personnel 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
to be successful  we need to hire candidates with appropriate qualifications and retain our key executives and employees 
the volatility of our stock price has had an impact on our ability to offer competitive equity based incentives to current and prospective employees  thereby affecting our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel 
if these adverse conditions continue  we may not be able to hire or retain highly qualified employees in the future and this could harm our business 
in addition  new regulations proposed by the nasdaq national market requiring shareholder approval for all stock option plans  as well as new regulations proposed by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions  could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
there have been several proposals on whether and or how to account for stock options 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  either of which could harm our business 
we use contractors to provide services to the company  which often involves contractual complexity  tax and employment law compliance  and being subject to audits and other governmental actions 
we have been audited for our contracting policies in the past  and may be in the future 
burdening our ability to freely use contractors to provide services to the company may increase the expense of obtaining such services  and or require us to discontinue using contractors and attempt to find  interview  and hire employees to provide similar services 
such potential employees may not be available in a reasonable time  or at all  or may not be hired without undue cost 
in the past  we implemented mandatory unpaid company wide shutdowns as a cost reduction measure  but we may not continue to implement these programs 
in the last two fiscal years and in each of the four quarters of  we implemented mandatory company wide shutdowns 
although these shutdown periods represent a cost savings to us  they may be perceived negatively by our customers  vendors and employees 
we currently intend to implement a company wide shutdown during the fourth quarter of in addition  we may continue to implement company wide shutdowns in future periods  which may negatively impact employee morale or the perception of our company by our customers and vendors 
if we elect not to implement these shutdowns  our operating expenses will increase 
our workforce reductions may seriously harm our business 
in connection with the restructuring program we began in the third quarter of to focus our business on products and technology in which we have  or believe we can achieve  a leadership position  and the reorganization of the company in the first quarter of into lines of business  we have implemented four workforce reductions  eliminating a total of positions 
as a result of the elimination of these positions  our marketing  sales and customer support capabilities could be reduced  our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired  we may become dependent on a few key employees  and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities 
these workforce reductions  or future workforce reductions  if any  may reduce employee morale and create concern among existing employees about job security  which could lead to increased turnover 
workforce reductions may also raise concerns among customers  suppliers and other corporate partners regarding our continued viability 
further  these workforce reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation  which could be costly to defend  divert the attention of management and subject us to possible liability for damages 
industry cycles may strain our management and resources 
cycles of growth and contraction in our industry may strain our management and resources 
to manage these industry cycles effectively  we must improve operational and financial systems  train and manage our employee base  successfully integrate operations and employees of businesses we acquire or have acquired  attract  develop  motivate and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience  and adjust spending levels according to prevailing market conditions 
if we cannot manage industry cycles effectively  our business could be seriously harmed 
our operations and the operations of our significant customers  third party wafer foundries and third party assembly and test subcontractors are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters 
our operations are headquartered in the san francisco bay area  which is susceptible to earthquakes  and the operations of cmd  which we acquired  are based in the los angeles area  which is also susceptible to earthquakes 
tsmc and umc  the outside foundries that produce the majority of our semiconductor products  are located in taiwan 
advanced semiconductor engineering  or ase  one of the subcontractors that assembles and tests our semiconductor products  is also located in taiwan 
for the year ended december   customers and distributors located in taiwan generated of our revenue and customers and distributors located in japan generated of our revenue 
for the year ended december   customers and distributors located in taiwan generated of our revenue and customers and distributors located in japan generated of our revenue 
both taiwan and japan are susceptible to earthquakes  typhoons and other natural disasters 
our business would be negatively affected if any of the following occurred an earthquake or other disaster in the san francisco bay area or the los angeles area damaged our facilities or disrupted the supply of water or electricity to our headquarters or our irvine facility  an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan resulted in shortages of water  electricity or transportation  limiting the production capacity of our outside foundries or the ability of ase to provide assembly and test services  an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan damaged the facilities or equipment of our customers and distributors  resulting in reduced purchases of our products  or an earthquake  typhoon or other disaster in taiwan or japan disrupted the operations of suppliers to our taiwanese or japanese customers  outside foundries or ase  which in turn disrupted the operations of these customers  foundries or ase and resulted in reduced purchases of our products or shortages in our product supply 
changes in environmental rules and regulations could increase our costs and reduce our revenue 
several jurisdictions are considering whether to implement rules that would require that certain products  including semiconductors  be made lead free 
we anticipate that some jurisdictions may finalize and enact such requirements 
some jurisdictions are also considering whether to require abatement or disposal obligations for products made prior to the enactment of any such rules 
although several of our products are available to customers in a lead free condition  most of our products are not lead free 
any requirement that would prevent or burden the development  manufacture or sales of lead containing semiconductors would likely reduce our revenue for such products and would require us to incur costs to develop substitute lead free replacement products  which may take time and may not always be economically or technically feasible  and may require disposal of non compliant inventory 
in addition  any requirement to dispose or abate previously sold products would require us to incur the costs of setting up and implementing such a program 
provisions of our charter documents and delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control  and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without stockholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  requiring super majority voting to amend some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent 
provisions of delaware law also may discourage  delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the price of our stock fluctuates substantially and may continue to do so 
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market valuation of many technology companies  including silicon image 
these factors  as well as general economic and political conditions  may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors  including  but not limited to actual or anticipated changes in our operating results  changes in expectations of our future financial performance  changes in market valuations of comparable companies in our markets  changes in market valuations or expectations of future financial performance of our vendors or customers  changes in our key executives and technical personnel  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations  design wins  contracts  standards or acquisitions 
due to these factors  the price of our stock may decline 
in addition  the stock market experiences volatility that is often unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decline regardless of our performance 
we are in the process of implementing an enterprise resource platform we are in the process of implementing an enterprise resource platform erp system  and of hosting that system on our site 
the system is comprised of hardware and software  and services  all of which we acquired from vendors  however  we are also customizing portions of the system with in house resources 
this requires careful management of the skills and resources to implement the erp system and to establish disaster recovery plans 
if we are unsuccessful  or if the hardware or software should fail  we could lose access to the data needed to book and fill customer orders  ship products  and produce financial reports  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
continued terrorist attacks or war could lead to further economic instability and adversely affect our operations  results of operations and stock price 
the united states has taken  and continues to take  military action against terrorism and has engaged in war with iraq and currently has an occupation force there and in afghanistan 
in addition  the current nuclear arms crises in north korea and iran could escalate into armed hostilities or war 
acts of terrorism or armed hostilities may disrupt or result in instability in the general economy and financial markets and in consumer demand for the oem s products that incorporate our products 
disruptions and instability in the general economy could reduce demand for our products or disrupt the operations of our customers  suppliers  distributors and contractors  many of whom are located in asia  which would in turn adversely affect our operations and results of operations 
disruptions and instability in financial markets could adversely affect our stock price 
armed hostilities or war in south korea could disrupt the operations of the research and development contractors we utilize there  which would adversely affect our research and development capabilities and ability to timely develop and introduce new products and product improvements 
we are in the process of establishing an office in japan we are in the process of establishing an office in japan 
accordingly  we are subject to risks  including  but not limited to being subject to japanese tax laws and potentially liable for paying taxes in japan  profits  if any  earned in japan will be subject to local tax laws and may not be repatriable to the united states  we will enter into employment agreements in connection with hiring personnel for the japanese office and will be governed by the provisions of the japanese labor laws  and the operations of the local office will be subject to the provisions of other local laws and regulations 
we are in the process of establishing an office in the republic of korea south korea we are in the process of establishing an office in the republic of korea south korea 
accordingly  we are subject to risks  including  but not limited to being subject to south korean tax laws and potentially liable for paying taxes in south korea  profits  if any  earned in south korea will be subject to local tax laws and may not be repatriable to the united states  we will enter into employment agreements in connection with hiring personnel for the south korea office and will be governed by the provisions of the south korean labor laws  and the operations of the local office will be subject to the provisions of other local laws and regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of fixed income securities that are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of our cash equivalents and short term investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on our near term results of operations or financial condition 
our long term capital lease obligations bear interest at fixed rates  therefore  our results of operations would not be affected by immediate changes in interest rates 
also  components of our stock compensation expense are tied to our stock price 
changes in our stock price can have a significant affect on the amount recorded as stock compensation expense 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our expenses are incurred in us dollars  thus limiting our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we currently do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies and do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the direct effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates should not have a material effect on our future operating results or cash flows  however  a long term increase in foreign currency rates would likely result in increased wafer  packaging  assembly or testing costs 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results
