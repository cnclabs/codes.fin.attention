general isolagen is a houston  texas based emerging pharmaceutical bioscience company which has focused its efforts in the development and commercialization of autologous cellular technology that has specific applications in cosmetic dermatology and is exploring applications for periodontal disease  reconstructive dentistry and other health related markets 
autologous cellular therapy is a process whereby a patient s own cells are extracted  reproduced and then reintroduced to the patient for specific cosmetic and medical applications 
unlike other applications for the treatment of dermal defects  isolagen utilizes only the patient s unique  living cells to produce the patient s own collagen 
there is no foreign substance utilized in this treatment protocol 
isolagen s goal is to become the industry leader in the research  development and commercialization of autologous cellular therapy which stimulate a patient s own collagen production 
the company s ability to operate profitably under its current business plan is largely contingent upon its success in obtaining further sources of debt and equity capital  prompt regulatory approval to sell its products and upon its continued expansion 
the company will require additional capital in the future to expand its operations 
no assurance can be given that the company will be able to obtain any such additional capital  either through equity or debt financing  on satisfactory terms or at all 
additionally  no assurance can be given that any such financing  if obtained  will be adequate to meet the company s ultimate capital needs and to support the company s growth 
if adequate capital cannot be obtained on satisfactory terms  the company s operations could be negatively impacted 
if the company achieves growth in its operations in the next few years  such growth could place a strain on its management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
the company s ability to manage its operations and growth requires the continued improvement of operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures 
in addition  the company may find it necessary to hire additional management  financial and sales and marketing personnel to manage the company s expanding operations 
if the company is unable to manage this growth effectively and successfully  the company s business  operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
as of december   the company had a cash balance of million 
as of march   the company had a cash balance of approximately million 
our existing capital resources are adequate to finance our operations until june   however the long term viability of the company is dependent upon successful operation of its business and the ability to raise additional debt and equity to meet our business objectives 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to those related to the impairment of long lived assets  reserves for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and the risk of loss transfers to the customer 
revenue from licenses and other up front fees are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the respective agreement 
milestone payments are recognized upon successful completion of a performance milestone event 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue over the period the service is performed in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we believe that all of these conditions are met at the time of shipment 
currently  three injections are recommended  although the decision to utilize one  two or three injections is between the attending physician and his her patient 
the amount invoiced is fixed and determinable and only varies among customers depending upon the number of injections requested 
there is no performance provision under any arrangement with any doctor and there is no right to refund  or returns for unused injections 
currently the isolagen process is delivered through an attending physician to each patient using the company s recommended regimen of up to three injections 
each injection has stand alone value to the patient 
the company invoices the attending physician upon that physician submitting his or her patient s tissue sample to the company  as a result of which the contractual arrangement is between the company and the medical professional 
the amount invoiced varies directly with the number of injections requested 
all orders are paid in advance by the physician and are not refundable 
revenue is deferred until shipment  provided no significant obligations remain  and is recognized in installments corresponding to the number of injections shipped to the attending physician 
due to the short shelf life  each injection is cultured on an as needed basis and shipped prior to the individual injection being administered by the physician 
the amount of the revenue deferral represents the fair value of the remaining undelivered injections measured in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses the issue of accounting for arrangements that involve the delivery of multiple products or services 
should the physician discontinue the regimen prematurely all remaining deferred revenue is recognized 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of facilities cost 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
the company accrues the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on its estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
intangible assets the company s intangible assets represent patent applications which are recorded at cost 
we have filed applications for patents in connection with technologies being developed 
the patent applications and any patents issued as a result of these applications are important to the protection of the company s technologies that may result from its research and development efforts 
costs associated with patent applications and maintaining patents are capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the patents 
the company reviews the value recorded for intangibles to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under sfas no

results of operations comparison of fiscal years ending december  and revenues

the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to the commencement of operations in the united kingdom 
included in fiscal was  in license fees recognized which did not recur in fiscal the isolagen process involves a patient s doctor obtaining an approximately mm punch skin sample from the patient 
the skin sample is packed in a container provided by us and shipped overnight to our laboratory 
the company invoices the doctor upon receipt of the skin sample 
the specimen is then cultured utilizing our patented isolagen process 
this process separates the cell  called a fibroblast  from the rest of the tissue then multiplies these fibroblasts 
approximately six weeks later  approximately ml of the patient s cells is sent to the doctor for treatment 
additional amounts of approximately ml are available for re injection every two to three weeks 
we recognize one third of the revenue associated with each treatment upon the shipment of the first injection to the patient s doctor  an additional one third of revenue associated with each treatment is recognized upon shipment of the second injection to the patient s doctor  and the remaining one third is recognized upon the shipment of the last injection to the patient s doctor

in the event that the fda requires additional studies or requires changes in our study protocols or in the event that the results of the studies are not consistent with our expectations the process will be more expensive and time consuming 
due to the vagaries of the fda approval process we are unable to predict what the cost of obtaining approval will be if fda approval is not forthcoming in the company has other research projects currently underway  including those related to repairing damaged nerves and therapies to regrow hair and to heal burned skin

the warrants are exercisable immediately after grant and expire five years thereafter 
the fair value of the warrants granted to the placement agent  based on the black scholes valuation model is estimated to be per warrant

the market value of the company s common stock sold on the dates that the preferred stock was sold had a range of per common share 
in accordance with eitf  application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments  this created a beneficial conversion to the holders of the preferred stock and a deemed dividend to the preferred stockholders totaling  was recorded by the company with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid in capital

other inflation 
inflation did not have a significant impact on our results during fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rates market risk 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
substantially all of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from operations in the uk 
we commenced operations in australia in the th quarter of the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations were principally measured in their respective currencies and translated into us dollars 
the effect of us dollar currency fluctuations against the foreign currency in these countries is somewhat mitigated by the fact that expenses are generally incurred in the same currencies in which the revenue is generated 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
additionally of our assets at december  were based in our foreign operations and translated into us dollars at the foreign currency exchange rate in effect as of the end of each accounting period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of consolidated shareholders equity 
accordingly  our consolidated shareholders equity will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency
