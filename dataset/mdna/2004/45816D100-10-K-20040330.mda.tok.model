item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of material acquisitions or dispositions that may affect the comparability of this financial information 
intelligent systems corporation 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  valuation of acquired intangibles and impairment of long lived assets  and valuation of investments to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
for a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition product revenue consists of fees from software licenses and sales or leases of industrial products 
service revenue consists of fees for implementation  consulting  training  reimbursable expenses  maintenance and support for software products 
we recognize revenue for industrial products when products are shipped  at which time title transfers to the customer 
there are no remaining future obligations and delivery occurs upon shipment 
we provide for estimated sales returns allowances and rebates in the period in which the sales are recorded 
as an alternative to selling the product  on occasion we may lease our equipment 
for leased equipment  we recognize revenue monthly at the contracted monthly rate during the term of the lease 
we recognize software fees in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  we recognize software license fees when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
additionally  license fee revenue is not recognized until there are no material uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  cancellation provisions  if any  have expired and there are no significant vendor obligations remaining 
sop no 
requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and all revenue recognition criteria in sop no 
other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the license fee is recognized as revenue 
for those contracts that contain significant production  modification and or customization  software license fees are recognized utilizing accounting research bulletin arb no 
 long term construction type contracts  using the relevant guidance in sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
for percentage of completion contracts  we measure the progress toward completion and recognize the software license fees based upon input measures ie in the same proportion that the amount of labor hours incurred to date bears to the total estimated labor hours required for the contract 
if reliable estimates cannot be determined  we follow the completed contract method 
under the completed contract method  all revenue is deferred until the customer has accepted the software and any refund rights have expired 
a number of internal and external factors could affect our estimates related to software contracts  including labor rates  utilization of resources  changes in specifications or testing requirements  and unforeseen technical problems 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or we do not manage the contract properly  in future periods we may need to restate revenues  to defer revenue longer than originally anticipated or to incur additional cost which would impact our margins and reported results 
valuation of investments we hold minority interests in non publicly traded companies whose values are difficult to determine and are based on management s estimate of realizability of the carrying value of the investment 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results  lack of progress of the underlying investee company or its inability to raise capital to support the business plan could result in investment losses or an inability to recover the current carrying value of the investment 
many of the companies in which we hold non control  minority positions are backed by venture capital  and the value of our investment may be impacted by the amount  terms and valuation of the investee s financial transactions with third party venture funds or the terms of the sale of the investee company to a third party 
our policy with respect to minority interests is to record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
for instance  this could occur if the investee company is sold for less than our pro rata carrying value or if a new round of funding is at a lower valuation than our investment was made or if the financing terms for the new intelligent systems corporation 
table of contents investors such as preferences on liquidation otherwise reduce the estimated value of our investment 
we do not write up the carrying value of our investments based on favorable changes or financial transactions 
at least quarterly  we review our investments to determine any impairment in their carrying value and we write down any impaired asset at quarter end to our best estimate of its current realizable value 
such charges could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and are generally not predictable or quantifiable in advance 
for instance  in note to the consolidated financial statements  we discuss aggregate charges totaling million which we recorded in to reflect a reduction in the carrying value of our investments in rf solutions  silverpop and medizeus 
charges were recorded in the first  second and fourth quarters of  respectively  based on the timing of the events giving rise to management s change in estimated valuation 
valuation of intangibles from time to time in the past  we have acquired companies and we may do so in the future 
occasionally  as in the case with our visaer and corecard software subsidiaries as described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  we may increase our ownership or control of an entity from a minority to a majority position  which generally is treated as an acquisition for accounting purposes 
purchase accounting for an acquisition requires use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased 
our business acquisitions may result in the allocation of a portion of the purchase price to goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of future period amortization expenses and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
typically  we use the services of a third party appraiser to provide a valuation of material intangible assets 
however  often the acquired company is a small entity with limited operating history on which to base future projections and thus valuing the assets requires the use of estimates which are very subjective 
furthermore  the period over which we amortize certain intangibles may change based on future conditions and consequently we may need to adjust the intangible value and or amortization period  which could require us to increase the amount of amortization expense we record each period or to take a non cash charge to reduce the value of the intangible 
on at least an annual basis  generally with the assistance of a third party appraiser  we review the values assigned to long lived assets using an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows of the entity over the remaining life of the asset 
any resulting impairment could require a write down that would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we did not acquire any companies in and no write downs with respect to goodwill or other intangibles occurred in or by comparison  in  we recorded charges totaling million related to the carrying value of visaer intangibles at the time of its acquisition and subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks 
overview our consolidated subsidiaries operate in two industry segments information technology products and services and industrial products 
included in the information technology sector are qs technologies  inc software for public health and human services  visaer  inc software for maintenance  repair and overhaul operations in the commercial aviation industry and corecard software  inc software for managing credit and debit cards 
the industrial products segment includes chemfree corporation bio remediating parts washers 
we derive our product revenue from sales of software licenses in our information technology sector and sales and leases of equipment and supplies in our industrial products sector 
our service revenue consists of fees for implementation  consulting  training  maintenance and support for software products in our information technology sector 
our consolidated revenue is the aggregate of the revenue generated at our four subsidiary companies 
our revenue fluctuates from period to period and our results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods 
period to period comparisons may not be meaningful and it is difficult to predict the level of consolidated revenue on a quarterly or annual basis for a number of reasons  including the following a change in revenue level at one of our subsidiaries may impact consolidated revenue or be offset by an opposing change at another subsidiary 
economic and marketplace trends may impact our subsidiaries differently or not at all and two of our software subsidiaries have very limited experience in their marketplaces which makes it difficult to identify and evaluate trends that may impact their business 
two of our software subsidiaries  corecard software and visaer  have been involved in major new product development initiatives for the past three years and have limited experience delivering and installing their new products at customer sites  making it difficult to predict with certainty when they will recognize revenue on individual software contracts 
our subsidiaries are relatively small in revenue size and  in the information technology sector  license revenue at a subsidiary in a given period may consist of a relatively small number of contracts 
consequently  even small delays in a subsidiary s delivery under a software contract which may be out of their control could have a significant and unpredictable impact on consolidated revenue that we can recognize in a given quarterly or annual period 
intelligent systems corporation 
table of contents acquisitions may affect our revenue and expense levels 
for instance  in  we acquired a controlling interest in corecard software and in mid  we acquired a controlling interest in visaer 
consequently  we consolidated the results of operations of those companies from the dates of acquisition but not for prior periods 
frequently we recognize consolidated operating losses on a quarterly and annual basis and are likely to do so in the future from time to time 
our operating expenses consist of the aggregate of our four subsidiaries expenses and the corporate office expenses 
our chemfree and qs technologies subsidiaries usually generate an operating profit on an annual basis but our early stage subsidiaries  visaer and corecard  presently do not  mainly due to significant research and development expense that is invested to complete their new product offerings and the deferral of revenue recognition until such products are delivered to customers in future periods 
depending upon the size and number of software licenses recognized in a particular period and the level of expenses incurred to support development and sales activities  our subsidiaries may report operating profits on an irregular basis as they build their customer base 
a significant portion of our subsidiaries expense is related to personnel which is relatively fixed in the short term and we continually evaluate and strive to balance our financial resources with the resources required to complete products under development and support our subsidiaries customers 
for these and other reasons  our operating profits or losses may vary from quarter to quarter and at the present time are generally not predictable with any degree of certainty 
we also frequently generate income or losses from non operating sources and we may do so from time to time in the future 
occasionally we derive income from sales of holdings in affiliate and other minority owned companies or we record a charge if we believe the value of a non consolidated company is impaired 
we also recognize on a quarterly basis our pro rata share of the income or losses of affiliate companies accounted for by the equity method 
the timing and amount of gain or loss recognized as a result of a sale or the amount of equity in the income or losses of affiliates generally are not under our control and are not necessarily indicative of future results  either on a quarterly or annual basis 
in recent years  most of our cash has been generated on an irregular basis from sales of our investments in early stage technology companies 
we have used a significant amount of the cash received from these sales to support the operations of our corecard software and visaer subsidiaries 
we do not expect and cannot support the same level of cash investment in the future in these two entities and presently believe that customer payments on existing and pending software contracts will be sufficient to fund visaer s operations and a growing portion of corecard s expenses 
if the business or cash flow of either subsidiary does not develop as anticipated  we would need to scale back or restructure their operations 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report 
compared to revenue total revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of percent million compared to the same period in revenue from product sales increased percent year to year from million to million whereas revenue from services billed by the information technology segment increased percent year to year from million to million 
the increase in product revenue is due to several factors software license fees generated by our information technologies segment subsidiary  qs technologies  accounted for percent of the total year to year increase and the industrial products segment accounted for the remaining percent of the year to year increase due to increased revenue from chemfree products in both domestic and international markets 
in  qs technologies benefited from pent up demand for its products by local and state governments after several years of reduced spending by such entities on software products 
almost percent of qs technologies product revenue was generated in the fourth quarter of upon delivery of its most recent product release to new customers 
based on the current pipeline and foreseeable demand  we may not achieve the same level of new license revenue in because we expect that state and local government budget constraints may reduce overall spending  including for software products 
our industrial products segment achieved a percent increase in international sales and a percent increase in domestic sales in compared to the year to year increase was due to approximately percent higher unit shipments of smartwasher parts washers and fluid  a percent increase in revenue from units leased to customers under multi site corporate lease contracts  and an increase of approximately four percent in the average selling price of parts washers and fluid due to price increases on certain products 
intelligent systems corporation 
table of contents some of the factors contributing to the year to year increase include expanded geographic coverage by domestic distributors  more installations at new and existing multi site corporate facilities and a larger installed base of customers who purchase replenishment supplies of fluids and filters 
we expect demand for chemfree products to continue to grow  although it is unlikely we would sustain the same level of high growth in the international markets in as in our corecard software subsidiary began generating limited revenue in while license revenue booked by our visaer subsidiary was approximately percent lower than in  mainly due to deferring revenue on new licenses sold until delivery of the final web based version of their licensed software in at december   we have recorded million of unearned short term deferred revenue and million of long term deferred revenue  of which percent of the total is related to visaer license fees and percent of the total is related to annual maintenance  support and lease contracts at three subsidiaries which will be recognized ratably over twelve months in with respect to our revenue from services  the increase from year to year from million to million reflects mainly a percent or  increase in maintenance and support revenue generated by our qs technologies subsidiary due to a larger installed base of customers paying annual maintenance fees as well as approximately  more revenue from training and other services provided excluding billable travel due to the record number of new customer licenses sold during the level of service revenue generated by our visaer subsidiary was relatively constant year to year 
cost of sales cost of product sales in was percent of product revenue  or million compared to percent of product revenue  or million in the difference between years is due to the significantly greater contribution of license revenue generated in by the qs technologies subsidiary which has a lower cost of sales than do our industrial products  which experienced a relatively consistent cost as a percentage of revenue in both and percent and percent in and  respectively 
cost of service sales in represented percent of service revenue or million compared to percent of service revenue  or million in the increase is due to higher personnel costs 
qs technologies allocated more resources to customer support functions in than in to support a high volume of new customers in and visaer utilized more expensive third party contractors for certain specialized development services in the first half of and utilized more of its personnel in the customer support and professional services departments in as compared to operating expenses consolidated operating expenses were percent lower in than in  decreasing from million to million 
both general and administrative and research and development expenses declined percent in compared to while marketing expenses were five percent lower than the prior year 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in mainly due to lower administrative and management personnel costs at corecard than had been incurred in early prior to the consolidation of corecard operations  saving approximately  in other factors contributing to the reduced expenses in were lower personnel costs at visaer offset in part by an increase of  in legal fees at chemfree and higher personnel costs at qs technologies 
research and development expense declined by percent in compared to from million to million principally due to a net reduction in the number of personnel employed in our domestic information technologies subsidiaries and a reduction in contract programming expense that had been incurred by visaer in related to the initial conversion and development of its web based software product 
interest income we recognized net interest income of  in compared to  in in  we earned interest on a higher level of notes receivable balances because we had a million note receivable outstanding for five months in and a million note receivable outstanding for four months in both notes were repaid or converted to equity in investment income we earned net investment income of million in compared to a net investment loss of  in in  net investment income includes a gain of million related to the paysys escrow settlement refer to note for details  offset in part by charges of   and  to reduce the carrying value of our investments in rf solutions inc  silverpop  inc and medizeus  inc  respectively 
in addition  we recorded charges of  and  against the carrying values of notes receivable of rf solutions  inc and medizeus  inc  respectively 
by comparison  in  we recorded investment gains of million on the sale of our holdings in atherogenics stock and  on the sale of our remaining interest in risk laboratories 
offset against these gains were charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of our investments in nutec sciences  inc  lumenor  inc  and novient  inc  three privately held software companies  and a charge of million to recognize the accumulated loss on our holdings in publicly traded daw technologies  inc and ixalt  inc 
refer to note for more details regarding these transactions 
the timing and amounts of asset sales or writedowns  if any  vary on an annual and quarterly basis and are generally not predictable by us in advance 
intelligent systems corporation 
table of contents equity earnings losses of affiliate companies on a quarterly basis  we recognize our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of affiliate companies that we record on the equity method 
the amount recorded is not generally predictable or indicative of future results because it is the aggregate earnings losses of a number of relatively small companies operating in various industries and thus aggregate earnings losses are subject to considerable fluctuation from quarter to quarter 
in  we recorded  in equity earnings of five affiliate companies including horizon software international  corexpand  riverside software  medizeus  and cirronet  for those periods in which we accounted for each by the equity method compared to equity losses in of  in three affiliate companies corexpand  medizeus and horizon software for those periods in which we accounted for each by the equity method 
other income  net we recognized  in other income in compared to other income of  in in  the amount includes  in recognition of deferred gain related to a visaer product line sale in a prior period   in foreign currency exchange gains  and other miscellaneous income 
by comparison  in other income consists mainly of  of deferred gain related to the visaer product line sale and other miscellaneous income 
income taxes in  we recorded an income tax credit of  representing the net of a  refund of alternative minimum taxes paid by the visaer subsidiary in a prior year and income tax of  related to our qs technologies state tax liability 
we did not accrue for any other income tax liability in and we believe that the deferred tax assets should be fully reserved given their character and our recent losses 
by comparison  in  we recorded an income tax benefit of  reflective of a refund of alternate minimum taxes paid in compared to revenue total revenue for the year ended december  was million versus million in the same period in  an increase of percent 
revenue from product sales increased percent year to year whereas revenue from services billed by the information technology segment increased percent year to year 
the increase in product revenue is mainly due to a greater number of units sold by the chemfree subsidiary due to an increase in domestic demand for its products 
the increase in service revenue year to year reflects mainly the fact that we included the results of visaer for the full months in but only for six months in approximately two thirds of our service revenue in was generated by visaer for professional services with the balance coming mainly from software maintenance contracts at the qs technologies subsidiary 
at december   long term deferred revenue was million  related to visaer s software license contract with a major us air freight company  which it expects to realize beginning in cost of sales in  total cost of sales was percent of revenue compared to percent of revenue in cost of product sales as a percentage of product revenue was percent in compared to percent in  reflecting mainly a reduction in the unit cost of producing chemfree products because fixed production overhead was spread across a higher volume of goods produced 
cost of service sales almost doubled in as compared to and represented percent of services revenue in as compared to percent in approximately million of the year to year increase in costs of service sales is attributed to including visaer costs for the full months in as compared to only six months in typically  costs associated with visaer service revenue involve higher labor costs than do costs associated with qs technologies services 
operating expenses in  marketing expenses increased by  percent compared to of the increase  approximately  is due to the inclusion of visaer expenses for months in   is due to increased expenditures at the chemfree subsidiary to support a direct sales initiative in selected markets  and the balance of  reflects mainly the inclusion of corecard expenses in general and administrative expenses were percent lower in than in  mainly reflecting the fact that expenses included non cash charges totaling million related to the write down of goodwill associated with the visaer acquisition in this decrease was offset by an increase of approximately  year to year mainly because we included the expenses of visaer for the full months in as compared to only six months in an increase in legal expenses in at chemfree of approximately  related to intellectual property protection was offset by a reduction in g a personnel expenses at the qs technologies subsidiary 
research and development expense increased by million percent in as compared to approximately one half of the increase is attributable to each of visaer and corecard due to the inclusion for the full year of their respective expenses to support significant new product development initiatives 
intelligent systems corporation 
table of contents interest income in  we earned  in interest income compared to million in the reduced interest income is because we earned significant interest on a high interest loan to paysys in before paysys was sold and the loan repaid 
in  we also had lower average cash balances and notes receivable balances than in and we earned interest at a lower rate than in investment income loss in  we had a net investment loss of  compared to net investment income of million in  of which million was derived from the sale of our paysys affiliate in in  we recorded investment gains of million on the sale of our holdings in atherogenics stock and  on the sale of our remaining interest in risk laboratories 
offset against these gains were charges totaling million to reduce the carrying value of our investments in nutec sciences  lumenor  and novient  three privately held software companies  and a charge of million to recognize the accumulated loss on our holdings in publicly traded daw technologies  inc and ixalt  inc 
refer to note for more details regarding these write downs 
the timing and amounts of asset sales or write downs  if any  vary on an annual and quarterly basis and are generally not predictable by us in advance 
equity losses of affiliates on a quarterly basis  we recognize our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of affiliate companies that we record on the equity method 
in some cases  these companies are early stage companies that incur losses during their development and early revenue period 
in  we recorded equity losses of  related to four affiliate companies compared to equity losses in of million related to seven affiliate companies 
the main difference between years is that we consolidated visaer and corecard for the full year in but in  we consolidated visaer only for the last half of the year and we accounted for corecard under the equity method for the entire year 
other income in  other income consists mainly of  of deferred gain related to a visaer product line sale in july  compared to the recognition of  of deferred gain related to the product line sale in refer to note for detail on the deferred gain 
income taxes in  we recorded an income tax benefit of  reflective of a refund of alternate minimum taxes paid in in  we incurred a net income tax expense of  representing a tax liability of  for alternative minimum tax on the paysys transaction and a tax benefit of  recorded at the visaer subsidiary 
the difference between our effective and statutory income tax rate is caused by our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources our cash balance at december  was million  which is million lower than at the prior year end 
during the year ended december   our principal source of cash was million from settlement of the paysys escrow account as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year  our principal use of cash was million for operations  which was million less than in we used approximately  cash  net of repayments and distributions  related to new and follow on investments or loans to investee companies in but plan to concentrate our activities and resources in on our existing companies 
in recent years  most of our cash has been generated on an irregular basis from sales of our investments in non consolidated technology companies and we have used a significant amount of the cash received from these sales to support the operations of our corecard software and visaer subsidiaries 
in  we used million to support these two subsidiaries which was  less than we used in we do not expect and cannot support the same level of cash investment in the future in these two subsidiaries 
based on recent trends and current projections  we presently believe that scheduled customer payments on existing and pending software contracts will be sufficient to fund substantially all of visaer s operations and a growing portion of corecard s expenses in if the business or cash flow of either subsidiary does not develop as anticipated either due to delays in customer payments  software development or new contract acquisitions  we would need to scale back or restructure the respective operations to a level that could be supported by their internal cash flow with minimal cash  if any  provided by us  or to seek alternative sources of funding for the subsidiaries 
most of our consolidated expenses are related to personnel  none of whom are represented by a union or have employment contracts 
thus  while there are no current plans to do so  any action to reduce negative cash flow from operations would generally entail a reduction in numbers of employees and the payment of accrued and severance compensation which could increase cash requirements in a given quarter but reduce cash needs in future quarters 
our established operating companies  qs technologies and chemfree  generated sufficient cash in to offset a majority of the corporate office expenses and are expected to do so again in there are no restrictions on the transfer of cash balances between the parent and subsidiary companies 
accounts receivable at december  were million  percent lower than at december   when they were million 
at december   our receivables were higher than normal for several reasons 
first  at december    of the intelligent systems corporation 
table of contents accounts receivable was related to billings to two visaer customers upon the achievement of contract milestones and such amounts were collected in early at year end december  there were no such scheduled milestone billings included 
second   of the year to year difference in accounts receivable is attributable to timing differences on billings of annual maintenance contracts for two visaer customers 
third  in the industrial products segment  increased emphasis on collections and stricter credit policies resulted in reduced collection cycles and improved cash flow in by approximately  in the aggregate  current and non current deferred revenue increased by million in compared to  representing cash payments in by customers for software licenses and annual software maintenance contracts by our information technology subsidiaries as well as leased industrial products equipment for which the related revenue will be recognized in future periods 
in  we used approximately  cash to increase inventory levels of chemfree products to support a growing volume of sales and leases of equipment to domestic and international customers 
accounts payables declined by  at december  compared to december  for several reasons 
of the decline   is related to a planned reduction in the use of third party software contractors in and the balance is mostly related to improved cash collections in the industrial products segment which allowed payment of payables generally within current terms 
we have several potential near term sources of cash to support negative cash flow from consolidated operations  including periodic draws against our bank line of credit  sale s of investments or other assets or third party strategic investment in a subsidiary 
the amount and timing of sales of investments or assets cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty at this time and presently we do not have any firm pending transactions 
our budgeted cash requirements for are substantially lower than for based on new and pending software license and professional services contracts at our information technology subsidiaries  recently negotiated periodic payments by two key customers at visaer  and lower product development costs at visaer and corecard 
we expect to use our bank line of credit as needed in to accommodate short term timing differences in consolidated cash flows 
we presently project that we will have sufficient accounts receivable and inventory balances throughout the year to provide the required borrowing base for such draws under our bank line of credit  however  if we fail to do so  we could experience a short term cash shortfall unless the bank provided an exception 
furthermore  if the bank elects not to renew our line of credit at the end of the current term september   we may not be able to find a replacement line of credit on acceptable terms  if at all 
certain visaer customer contracts tie cash payments to delivery dates of various software deliverables and in other cases  customers have agreed on periodic payments at scheduled time periods to enable the company to dedicate resources to complete contract deliverables 
visaer is working closely with key customers to meet its project milestones but delays could cause customers to postpone payments and increase visaer s need for cash during also our ability to recognize deferred revenue reflected on the balance sheet will depend on visaer delivering and the customer accepting the final software deliverables in and thereafter 
presently  we do not believe there is a material risk to successfully performing under these contracts but if customer payments are delayed for any reason or we do not control costs or we encounter unforeseen technical problems  then visaer could experience a cash shortfall to fund its operations and would need to scale back its operations or seek new financing  which could affect its performance under the contracts  at least in the short term 
in addition  unanticipated delays in contract awards and implementations at corecard would have a negative impact on results of operations and increase our cash requirements 
beyond  we expect that liquidity will continue to improve and consolidated operations will generate sufficient cash to fund their requirements with use of our credit facility to accommodate short term needs 
other long term sources of liquidity include potential sales of investments or other assets although the timing and amount of any such transactions are uncertain and  to the extent they involve non consolidated companies  generally not within our control 
we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
long term contractual obligations our only material long term contractual obligations consist of operating leases as indicated below payment due by period contractual obligations less than more than in thousands total year years years years operating lease obligations total intelligent systems corporation 
table of contents factors that may affect future operations future operations in both the information technology and industrial products segments are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact our future results of operations or projected cash requirements 
it is difficult to predict future quarterly and annual results with any certainty mainly because several of our subsidiaries are early stage companies with limited revenue and experience in their respective markets  all are relatively small in size and  particularly in the information technology sector  revenue tends to be associated with fewer and larger sales than in the industrial products segment 
thus any trend or delay that affects even one of our subsidiaries could have a negative impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or cash requirements on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  the carrying value of our investments is impacted by a number of factors which are generally beyond our control since we are typically a non control shareholder in a private company with limited liquidity 
among the numerous factors that may affect our consolidated results of operations or financial condition are the following delays in software development projects which could cause our customers to delay implementations  delay payments or cancel contracts  which would increase our costs and reduce our revenue 
undetected software errors which may delay product releases  increase our costs  result in non acceptance of our software by customers or delay revenue recognition 
competitive pressures including pricing  changes in customer requirements and preferences  and competitor product offerings which may cause prospective customers to choose an alternative product solution  resulting in lower revenue and profits or increased losses 
the inability of our corecard or visaer subsidiaries to establish a base of referenceable customers for their new product offerings  resulting in lower revenue and profits or increased losses  increased cash needs and possibly leading to restructuring or cutting back of the subsidiary s operations 
failure of our products specifications and features to achieve market acceptance 
delays in anticipated customer payments for any reason which would increase our cash requirements and possibly our losses 
declines in performance  financial condition or valuation of minority owned companies which could cause us to write down the carrying value of our investment or postpone an anticipated liquidity event  which could negatively impact our earnings and cash 
a reversal of the improving trend in the commercial aviation industry worldwide which could impact visaer s short term customer purchases  thus increasing its losses and need for cash 
the relatively limited sales and marketing experience of our visaer and corecard subsidiaries in their respective markets could cause them to misinterpret or fail to interpret or adjust to a trend in the market or to underestimate the sales cycle time frame 
in the industrial products market  failure by chemfree to achieve anticipated growth in the european market or in the domestic national accounts and non automotive markets for their products could cause lower than anticipated sales and profits 
an insufficient number of potential corecard customers decide to purchase and run an in house software system and instead choose to outsource their account transaction processing which could result in lower revenue  increased costs and greater cash requirements 
budget reductions by state and local governments for information technology products that delay award of contracts or implementations for our qs technologies subsidiary 
an insufficient level of qualifying accounts receivable and inventories to support a borrowing base sufficient to meet our anticipated borrowing requirements under our bank line of credit 
the recurrence of some incidence such as the sars epidemic in that has a negative impact on the aviation industry  resulting in delays in contract awards and customer implementations similar to the unforeseen negative impact on cash and profits experienced by visaer during the sars epidemic 
other general economic and political conditions  particularly those which may cause international business and domestic government customers to delay or cancel software purchase decisions 
we have certain lease commitments  legal matters and contingent liabilities described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are not aware presently of any facts or circumstances related to these that are likely to have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition
