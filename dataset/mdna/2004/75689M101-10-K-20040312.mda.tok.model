item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides a narrative on our financial performance and condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors including  but not limited to  those discussed in risk factors under item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this section includes the following discussions overview change in method of calculating comparable restaurant sales results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations inflation critical accounting policies and estimates recent accounting developments forward looking statements overview red robin is a casual dining restaurant chain focused on serving an imaginative selection of high quality gourmet burgers in a family friendly atmosphere 
we currently own and operate casual dining restaurants under the name red robin america s gourmet burgers spirits in states and have additional restaurants operating under franchise or license agreements in states and two canadian provinces 
during  we opened new company owned restaurants and assumed operations of one existing franchise restaurant 
ten new franchise restaurants were opened during our fiscal years ended december   december  and december  are referred to as  and  respectively 
each year presented included weeks 
we also refer to our fiscal year ending december   as change in method of calculating comparable restaurant sales during  we changed our method of calculating company owned comparable restaurant sales 
under our new method  restaurants become comparable in the first period following five full quarters of operations 
prior to this change  our restaurants became comparable in the first period following the first full fiscal year of operations 
we believe the new method of calculating comparable restaurant sales is a more meaningful measure given our accelerated new restaurant unit growth  and that our new methodology is more in line with industry practices 
throughout this annual report on form k  we present company owned comparable restaurant sales using the new method for all periods presented 
the ten restaurants that we acquired from two franchisees during first quarter were also included as comparable restaurants for these restaurants had been open an average of years as of the beginning of  and as a result we believed it was more meaningful to include the acquired restaurants in our calculation of comparable restaurant sales 
including the acquired restaurants  our company owned comparable restaurant sales for increased over had we not included these ten restaurants  comparable restaurant sales for would have increased over 
table of contents results of operations our operating results for each fiscal year presented below are expressed as a percentage of total revenues below  except for the components of restaurant operating costs  which are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues revenues restaurant franchise royalties and fees rent revenue total revenues costs and expenses restaurant operating costs cost of sales labor operating occupancy restaurant closures and impairment total restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization general and administrative franchise development pre opening costs gain on lease buy out impairment of real estate held for sale income from operations other income expense interest expense interest income loss on extinguishment of debt other total other expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income compared to total revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to a million increase in restaurant revenues 
the increase in restaurant revenues was due to million of revenues from new restaurants opened and the one franchise restaurant we assumed operation of during  million in additional revenues from the non comparable restaurants that we opened in  million related to a full year of revenues for the ten restaurants we acquired from two franchisees during first quarter and million from comparable restaurant sales increases of 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales was driven by an increase in guest counts of and an increase in the average guest check of 
franchise royalties and fees increased  or  to million from million 
franchise royalties increased  or  to million  from million  due to an increase in royalties attributable to new franchise restaurants  comparable us franchise restaurant revenues increases of  and an increase in royalties from our canadian franchisee primarily due to more favorable currency exchange rates 
royalties from the ten new franchise restaurants opened during were partially offset because four franchise restaurants closed and we assumed the operations of one additional franchise restaurant in april franchise fees increased  or  to  from  because ten franchise restaurants were opened in compared to five in 
table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated during cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenues increased  to  from 
overall  the increase as a percentage of restaurant revenues was attributable to increases in certain food costs during  including gourmet breads  hamburger  produce and pork 
in addition  we experienced a slight increase as a percentage of restaurant revenues because of a shift in product mix at our comparable restaurants towards salads 
to help offset increased commodity price pressure  we implemented a menu price increase in january labor 
labor expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in overall  labor expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues was in and labor as a percentage of restaurant revenues was at our comparable restaurants and at our non comparable restaurants 
total wages as a percentage of restaurant revenues decreased during  due to improvements in controllable labor and floor supervisory wages at our non comparable restaurants and the ten restaurants we acquired in however  these improvements were entirely offset by an increase of for self insured workers compensation expenses  for bonus expenses and for payroll tax expenses 
the increase in bonus expenses was primarily due to higher bonuses earned as a result of improved comparable restaurant sales 
our workers compensation expense increased during due to a combination of higher claims experienced and higher per claim costs 
we cannot predict with certainty whether or not our workers compensation expense will continue to increase in operating 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenues decreased  to  from 
we believe the improvement as a percentage of restaurant revenues was due in part to our increase in comparable restaurant sales and the discontinuance of one of our marketing funds midway through first quarter  for which we had previously contributed of restaurant revenues 
these improvements were partially offset by higher utilities  paper packaging costs  telecommunications charges and credit card processing fees 
based on recent trends  we anticipate potentially significant increases in natural gas and electricity expenses during however  at this time  we cannot forecast the impact these increases may have on operating expenses 
occupancy 
occupancy expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues was in and occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues at our comparable restaurants was  compared to the prior year 
this increase was driven by higher occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues at the ten restaurants we acquired in  partially offset by leverage gained from improvement in our comparable restaurant sales 
occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant revenues at our non comparable restaurants was  which is lower than our comparable restaurants due to the fact that we own  or have ground leases  on a greater percentage of our non comparable restaurants as compared to our comparable restaurants 
restaurant closures and impairment 
we recorded a million non cash impairment charge in to fully write down all of the long lived assets related to one restaurant  which we continue to operate 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of new restaurants opened in and a full year of depreciation related to the ten restaurants we opened during depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues increased  to  from 
the increase as a percentage of total revenues is primarily a result of higher depreciation per restaurant on our newer restaurants 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  generally due to additional headcount  higher salaries and related costs attributable to operating more company owned restaurants and to costs associated with our public company reporting requirements 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues  however  decreased  to  from 
the improvement in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues is due primarily to a decrease in marketing expenditures and to our increase in comparable restaurant sales 
in addition  we had unfilled positions in that we did not fill until fourth quarter that positively impacted our results in 
table of contents franchise development 
franchise development expenses decreased  or  to million  from million 
franchise development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased  to  from  due primarily to several unfilled positions that we did not fill until fourth quarter and to a related reduction in other franchise development expenses  including travel and legal 
pre opening costs 
pre opening costs increased million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to the fact that there were company owned restaurants opened during  compared to ten during pre opening costs as a percentage of total revenues increased  to  from 
pre opening costs for the restaurants we opened in averaged  per restaurant compared to an average of  per new restaurant in pre opening costs recognized in related to restaurants we intend to open in were not significant 
gain on lease buy out 
during  we realized a non recurring gain of  due to a landlord lease buy out of one of our company owned restaurants and  as a result  we relocated the restaurant to a new location during impairment of real estate held for sale 
during  we recognized a  charge to reduce the carrying value of real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
this property was subsequently sold in for its approximate carrying value 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million  from million 
the decrease was due primarily to lower average borrowings outstanding and a reduction in the overall interest rate of our debt in  compared to our average borrowings outstanding decreased because net proceeds from our july initial public offering and our november secondary offering were used to repay significant portions of our then outstanding borrowings 
interest income 
interest income decreased  or  to  from  the results include interest income of  from related party notes receivable  compared to  in the remaining change was attributable to decreases in interest income from franchisees and interest earned on our overnight sweep accounts

during  we incurred  of charges related to the exercise of three capital lease purchase options and the payoff of various real estate and equipment loans  which included a  non cash write off of capitalized debt issuance costs 
during  we incurred million of charges related to prepayment penalties of million and a million non cash write off of capitalized debt issuance costs 
debt extinguished in had a carrying value of million compared to million in  excluding penalties and fees 
other 
other income was  in  compared to other expense of  in other expense principally includes holding costs associated with real estate held for sale  offset in by a gain on the sale of real estate 
income before income taxes 
as a result of the above  income before income taxes increased million  or  to million  from million 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was due primarily to increased pre tax earnings and an increase in our estimated effective income tax rate

table of contents net income 
as a result of the above  net income increased by million  or  to million  from million 
compared to total revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to a million increase in restaurant revenues 
the increase in restaurant revenues was due to million in restaurant revenues derived from ten restaurants acquired from two franchisees in first quarter  million of restaurant revenues from ten new restaurants opened in  million in additional restaurant revenues from the non comparable restaurants that we opened prior to  and million from comparable restaurant sales increases of 
for  the increase in comparable restaurant sales was driven by an increase in guest counts of and an increase in the average guest check of approximately compared to these increases in restaurant revenues were offset by one restaurant closure in  and two restaurant closures in that contributed million more in revenue in than in we believe that unfavorable local economic conditions originally related to a downturn in the telecommunications and technology industries had an adverse affect on restaurant revenues in our seattle  portland and denver markets  which combined represented of our comparable sales for for these markets  comparable restaurant sales for decreased 
excluding these markets  comparable restaurant sales increased 
franchise royalties and fees decreased by  or  to million  from million 
franchise royalties decreased  or  to million  from million 
this was due in part to the fact that there were fewer franchise restaurants open during because we acquired ten franchise restaurants during first quarter in addition  comparable restaurant sales for our franchisees  upon which royalties are primarily based  declined in the us and in canada during compared to the prior year 
franchise fees decreased  or  to  from  because there were five new franchise restaurant openings in compared new franchise restaurant openings in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated during cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenues decreased  to  from 
this reduction in cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenues was primarily a result of favorable commodity pricing and in part due to continuing management initiatives to reduce the cost of food and beverage products  reduce waste in our restaurants and improve margins

labor expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated during labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenues increased  to  from 
labor increased as a percentage of restaurant revenues at comparable restaurants  from of restaurant revenues  to 
the increase as a percentage of sales at comparable restaurants was due in part to higher controllable labor and floor supervisory wages as well as increased benefit costs 
we also experienced higher controllable labor  floor support  management salaries and taxes and benefits at the restaurants we opened and acquired in and when compared to labor at comparable restaurants 
labor as a percentage of restaurant revenues for the and new and acquired restaurants was in operating 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenues decreased to  from 
the decrease was due primarily to utility expenses  which decreased  to of restaurant revenues  compared to in utility expenses were higher all over the country in  but especially in southern california  where electricity costs were significantly higher during certain periods during compared to excluding utilities  operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenues increased  to in  from in occupancy 
occupancy expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million  due primarily to more restaurants being operated in occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant revenues decreased  to  from  primarily due to the fact that our restaurant revenues increased at a rate greater than the fixed component of our occupancy costs 

table of contents restaurant closures and impairment 
we recognized a million non cash impairment charge in to fully write down all of the long lived assets related to one restaurant  which we continue to operate 
the  loss in represented the write down of residual value related to one restaurant originally impaired in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  from million 
the increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the ten restaurants opened in  six new restaurants opened during  and ten restaurants acquired in first quarter as reported  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues was in and however  results include million of amortization related to goodwill and other intangible assets that are no longer being amortized as of the beginning of excluding the million of amortization charges  depreciation would have increased  from of total revenues in  to of total revenues in the primary reason for this change is attributable to higher depreciation per unit on our and restaurant openings 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million  from million 
overall  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to  compared to 
the increase in expense is primarily a result of additional headcount and higher salaries and related costs attributable to operating more company owned restaurants and to increased legal and accounting costs associated with our public company reporting requirements 
restaurant operations  marketing and legal costs increased as a percentage of total revenue  whereas design and construction  human resources and accounting costs decreased as a percentage of total revenue when compared to costs related to management information systems  purchasing and executive management were relatively unchanged as a percentage of total revenues 
franchise development 
franchise development expenses decreased  to million  from million  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues to  from 
the decrease in franchise development expenses was primarily due to the fact that the franchisees opened fewer new restaurants in  compared to pre opening costs 
pre opening costs increased by million to million  from  the increase was due primarily to opening ten restaurants in  compared to six in average pre opening costs per restaurant increased an average of  for restaurants opened in  compared to restaurants opened in this increase was due to the fact that during we opened a higher proportion of new restaurants in markets where we did not have significant market penetration compared to new restaurant openings in pre opening costs related to restaurant openings in newer markets are typically higher than pre opening costs in our more mature markets due to increased labor  training  travel and marketing supplies costs 
gain on lease buy out 
during  we realized a non recurring gain of  due to a landlord lease buy out of one of our company owned restaurants 
as a result  we relocated the restaurant to a new location during the early termination fee received of million was presented net of related charges of  for the disposal of property and equipment from the original restaurant that was non transferable and other non recurring charges associated with the relocation of  impairment of real estate held for sale

the results include interest income of  from related party notes receivable  whereas there was no related party interest income during 
table of contents loss on extinguishment of debt 
during  we incurred a million charge attributable to prepayment penalties and a million non cash write off of certain capitalized debt issuance costs that resulted when we used proceeds from our initial public offering  together with borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  to repay all outstanding borrowings under our finova term loan and us bank revolving credit facility  as well as one real estate loan and three equipment loans 
we early adopted sfas in and consequently did not classify the loss on extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased by  in we attempt to keep only enough cash on hand to satisfy our working capital requirements  which can vary substantially as a result of seasonality  construction and other corporate needs 
all available cash in excess of our estimated working capital needs are generally used to repay short term borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
the change in cash and cash equivalents for the most recent three fiscal years is as follows in thousands cash provided by operations cash used by investing activities cash provided by financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash provided by operations in increased million  or  to million  compared to million in  reflecting increased cash flow from restaurant and franchise operations  lower cash payments for interest  lower cash payments related to the extinguishment of debt  and increased cash flow from changes in operating assets and liabilities 
these increases were partially offset by higher income tax payments and other non cash adjustments to net income 
investing activities cash used in investing activities during increased million  or  to million  compared to million in our investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment related to the construction of new restaurants and remodels and capital improvements of our existing company owned restaurants 
we may also have activity related to the acquisition of franchise restaurants

in addition  we expect to invest million to million for corporate initiatives  including information systems and computer equipment 
our investment for corporate initiatives includes an estimate of million related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters during for additional information regarding the relocation of our corporate headquarters see properties included in item of this annual report on form k 
proceeds from investing activities 
proceeds of  in were generated primarily from the sale of one property held for sale 
proceeds of  in were generated primarily from the sale of one property held for sale 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities during increased million 
our financing activities consist primarily of borrowings used to fund restaurant construction and other corporate needs in excess of cash provided by operations and proceeds we receive from sales of common stock 
cash used in financing activities is primarily related to the repayment of various borrowings 
during  we expect our primary source of cash provided by financing activities will be obtained from additional borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
proceeds from the issuance of stock 
in july  we completed an initial public offering from which we received net proceeds of million 
concurrently  we entered into a three year million revolving credit agreement 
net proceeds from our initial public offering  together with new borrowings from our revolving credit agreement were used to repay million of then outstanding debt  including accrued interest and prepayment penalties 
during november  we completed a secondary public offering in which we sold  shares  at a price of per share 
we received proceeds of million from the offering  net of million of underwriting fees and commissions and  of other offering costs 
we used the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
other proceeds of  were received from the exercise of stock options and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
borrowings 
during may  we amended our million revolving credit agreement to increase our maximum borrowing capacity to million  and to extend the term of the agreement through may  the amendment of our revolving credit agreement resulted in  of debt issuance costs that we will amortize ratably over the remaining life of the agreement 
this agreement is in place to fund the construction and acquisition of new restaurants  to refinance existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
the amended revolving credit agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of all of the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries and a first priority lien on substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants related to the revolving credit agreement 

table of contents during  our borrowings of long term debt totaled million  excluding million of new capital lease obligations  and our payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations totaled million 
debt outstanding during the year had stated interest rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from through our borrowing activity in was as follows in thousands additions payments total revolving credit agreement new capital lease obligations non cash repayment of three capital lease obligations repayment of various real estate and equipment loans other repayments of capital leases and collateralized notes payable total we were required under our revolving credit agreement to exercise the purchase options related to our restaurant leases in highlands ranch  colorado  issaquah  washington  and grapevine  texas 
the exercise of the highlands ranch purchase option was completed in january for million  the exercise of the issaquah purchase option was completed in august for million and the exercise of our grapevine purchase option was completed in september for million 
in addition  during second quarter  we elected to repay million of various real estate and equipment loans 
these loans were payable monthly over remaining terms ranging from three to eight years and were subject to fixed interest rates ranging from to 
the exercise of the capital lease purchase options and prepayment of the real estate and equipment loans resulted in  of charges for loss on extinguishment of debt  including  of non cash expenses related to the write off of capitalized debt issuance costs 
we do not currently plan early repayments of any borrowings during  and our revolving credit agreement does not require the early extinguishment of any additional borrowings 
as of december   borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement bore interest at approximately 
on september   an irrevocable letter of credit issued under our revolving credit agreement was increased to  this letter is being maintained to back our self insured workers compensation program and reduces the amount of borrowings available on our revolving credit agreement 
our total committed borrowing capacity  capacity used and unused borrowing capacity as of the end of were as follows in thousands committed capacity capacity used unused capacity revolving credit agreement the revolving credit agreement requires that capital expenditures  as defined  will not exceed specified amounts for each fiscal year as set forth in the following table in thousands 
however  to the extent we do not exceed the annual limitations  any unused amount up to million in any fiscal year will be carried forward to the following fiscal year and will increase the limit in the succeeding year by such carry forward amount 
we carried forward million from  in accordance with the agreement  which will increase the limit set forth below for amount the revolving credit agreement prohibits us from entering into or assuming any obligations for the payment of rent under operating leases which  with respect to all new restaurants opened in each fiscal year in the aggregate  would exceed million in each of  and in addition  the revolving credit agreement prohibits us from entering into obligations with respect to operating leases that would allow for an annual increase  on a year to year basis  of more than 
at the end of  we had million outstanding under various real estate and equipment loans with ge capital 
these loans bear interest at the day commercial paper rate plus to  mature from to 
table of contents  and are secured by buildings  equipment and improvements on certain properties 
in addition  we had million outstanding under various real estate and equipment loans with other lenders 
these loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and mature from to the ge capital loans  together with certain of our other loans  require that we maintain a maximum debt to net worth ratio  a minimum debt coverage ratio  a minimum ebitda ratio and a maximum funded indebtedness ratio 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these financial ratios 
capital resources 
we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations and funds available from our existing revolving credit agreement  together with cash on hand  will provide sufficient funds to finance our expansion plans and corporate initiatives through the remaining term of our revolving credit agreement 
changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events may make it necessary for us to seek additional debt or equity financing in future periods 
there can be no guarantee that financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could negatively impact our growth plans and our financial condition and results of operations 
additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants and or financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate our business 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
however  other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for example  we are contractually committed to fulfill various operating lease obligations related to our company owned restaurants and other properties 
the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations long term debt obligations represent our borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and other collateralized notes payable 
capital lease obligations include interest of million 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease commitments payable for land  buildings and equipment used in our operations 
the amounts presented above have not been reduced by rental income from sublease arrangements that we enter into from time to time 
purchase obligations include lease commitments related to unopened company owned restaurants  commitments related to the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects  commitments related to our corporate headquarters relocation  commitments to purchase land  information technology contracts  including software licenses  maintenance and service agreements  commitments to purchase land related to new restaurants  employment agreements for two officers and other contractual obligations 

table of contents inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation had a modest impact on our results of operations in as a result of rising commodity prices for certain foods we purchase at market rates 
however  we cannot quantify this impact  if any 
uncertainties related to future commodity prices and the supply of labor make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have in and beyond 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
at the beginning of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets must be tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and at least once annually 
we completed our most recent impairment test in december  and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we assess other long lived assets  including property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we perform this assessment on a restaurant by restaurant basis and will recognize an impairment loss when we believe the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows or appraisals  if available 
revenue recognition for franchise royalties and fees 
royalties are accrued as earned  and are calculated each period based on the reporting franchisee s adjusted sales 
under certain circumstances  where collection of franchise royalties is not probable  we do not recognize royalty income until cash is received 
we typically grant franchise rights for a term of years  with the right to extend the term for an additional ten years if certain conditions are satisfied 
we provide management expertise  training  pre opening assistance and restaurant operating assistance in exchange for area development fees  franchise fees  license fees and royalties of to of the franchised restaurant s adjusted sales 
under our current form of area development agreement  we collect a  area development fee for each restaurant the franchisee agrees to develop at the time we enter into the area development agreement 
when a franchisee opens a new restaurant  we collect an additional franchise fee of  we may charge lower area development fees and franchise fees for existing franchisees 
area development fees and franchise fees are recognized as income when all material obligations of and initial services to be provided by us have been performed  generally upon the opening of the restaurant 
until earned  these fees are accounted for as deferred income  a liability 
income taxes 
current tax liabilities or assets are recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains  and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in financial statements 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate principally as a result of state income taxes  general business and other tax credits and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
we realize significant tax credits because our employees receive cash tips from customers 
in addition  we are required to make estimates in determining various state income tax rates 
estimating fica tip credits and state income tax rates is inherently difficult  and actual results may differ materially from the estimates we use when reporting income taxes in our financial statements 

table of contents deferred tax liabilities are recognized for the estimated effects of all taxable temporary differences  and deferred tax assets are recognized for the estimated effects of all deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the measurement of our current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted tax laws 
current financial accounting standards do not require us to consider the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates when making our estimates 
the measurement of our deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
our provision or benefit for income taxes each year includes the tax consequences of most events that are recognized in the financial statements for that year 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized  and minor replacements  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes  based on the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the underlying lease of the related asset 
we use other depreciation methods  generally accelerated  for tax purposes where appropriate 
we capitalize interest incurred on funds used to construct property and equipment 
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset s estimated useful life 
depreciation expense represents a significant estimate of the decline in usefulness of assets 
however  we believe that the estimated useful lives we assign to our assets result in an accurate allocation of depreciation expense during the periods benefited by use

sfas became effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas changed the timing of expense recognition for certain costs incurred while closing restaurants or undertaking other exit or disposal activities  however  we do not believe potential timing differences  as they relate to a restaurant closures  will typically be significant 
sfas also established that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position  because we did not have any exit or disposal activities that were subject to the provisions of sfas

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposures for our assets are related to cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
under our amended revolving credit agreement  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or a libor  based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to 
the spread  or margin  for abr and libor loans under the revolving credit agreement are subject to quarterly adjustment based on our then current leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we may use interest rate swaps and caps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
as appropriate  on the date derivative contracts are entered into  we designate derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
during december  we entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of january   which expires on january  the agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge under which we will pay interest on million of notional amount at a fixed rate and receive interest on million of notional amount at a variable rate 
the variable rate interest received by us was initially based on the month libor rate determined two banking days prior to the effective date 
thereafter  the interest rate resets according to the then current month libor rate determined two banking days prior to the first day of each monthly calculation period 
this hedge is highly effective as defined by sfas  and there were no gains or losses recognized in earnings during or at the end of  the unrealized loss on derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedging instruments that are reported in comprehensive income totaled  net of tax of  compared to  net of tax of  in our variable rate based loans with ge capital bear interest at the day commercial paper rate plus a fixed percentage of to 
as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates  and a change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuating  on an annualized basis 
primarily all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of no more than a year 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
