item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currently  we are a diversified operator of twelve wholly owned gaming entertainment properties and one joint venture property 
headquartered in las vegas  we have operations in nevada  illinois  louisiana  mississippi  indiana and new jersey 
our main business emphasis is on slot revenues which is highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties 
gaming revenue is one of the main performance indicators of our properties 
most of our revenue is cash based and our properties generate significant operating cash flow 
our industry is capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing  fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development and the payment of dividends

our underlying goal has been to increase shareholder value 

table of contents operationally  we have been focused on borgata  the effects of new or increased taxes as well as the effects of competition in the various markets in which we operate 
borgata 
during july  borgata  our billion joint venture destination resort in atlantic city  new jersey  began operations 
we commenced construction on this property in from the start of operations  borgata s revenues have been strong  especially in table games where the property reported the highest table game revenue in the atlantic city market for both the third and fourth quarters of borgata s management is working to fine tune its operations and decrease operating expenses and  therefore  increase its operating margins 
taxes 
in both and  illinois raised gaming taxes that have negatively impacted our par a dice property 
we are looking forward to a repeal of the new taxes  returning them to pre july levels that will occur on july  or upon the award and opening of the tenth illinois casino license  whichever transpires first 
also  indiana enacted higher gaming taxes in which have negatively impacted our blue chip operation 
both par a dice and blue chip continue to monitor their operations to find potential ways to minimize the effects of the tax increases 
in addition  nevada increased gaming and other taxes during we expect our results to be impacted by the effects of these tax increases 
competition 
as the gaming industry is highly competitive  we must continually refine our marketing and promotional programs to attract and retain our customers 
in addition  we continually enhance our properties and our products to make the gaming experience pleasant for our customers to encourage repeat visitation to our properties 
in  we announced expansion plans for both our delta downs and blue chip properties 
at delta downs  the plans for the million expansion include more space for the casino floor and a room hotel 
we hope to position ourselves better in the market by improving the casino environment and offering our customers more amenities 
in addition  we hope the expansion will help mitigate the effects of the new pinnacle casino that is expected to open in in lake charles  louisiana 
at blue chip  our early plans involve building a new one story boat and a new parking structure 
the plans for the project  which are subject to regulatory and other approvals  are still being developed and an expected cost has not yet been determined 
at blue chip  we are also hoping to position ourselves better in the current market environment with an improved facility and to be prepared to compete more effectively if a land based operation is developed in our area in the future 
strategic growth

the transaction is expected to be completed in mid  subject to obtaining gaming and other approvals and customary closing conditions 
in addition  in  borgata s management announced that they were entering the planning process for an expansion of their facility  including expanding the casino  and adding other amenities

year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated gaming revenues consolidated gaming revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the primary reasons for the increase in gaming revenues are as follows delta downs racetrack and casino commenced slot operations in february gaming revenues at delta downs increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
a portion 
table of contents of the increase is due to increased slot wagering for the period of time the property was open in both and as the property continues to refine and improve its marketing programs 
in august  blue chip commenced dockside operations which resulted in a increase in gaming revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  increased slot wagering at sam s town las vegas  due to more effective marketing strategies  was the primary reason its gaming revenue increased for as compared to partially offsetting the increases in gaming revenue was a decline in gaming revenue at par a dice 
the property has experienced declines in slot wagering during due primarily to the effects of competition  mainly from neighboring states that have a more favorable gaming tax structure than illinois 
wholly owned property adjusted ebitda wholly owned property adjusted ebitda decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the primary reasons for the decline are as follows as discussed above  par a dice experienced a decline in gaming revenue for while its gaming taxes were increased in both july and july for the year ended december   based on the current year s gaming revenue and admissions  par a dice s gaming tax expense increased million as compared to as discussed above  gaming taxes at blue chip increased beginning july for the year ended december   based on the current year s gaming revenue and admissions  blue chip s gaming tax expense increased million as compared to in addition  blue chip recorded a million one time retroactive gaming tax charge reflecting taxes imposed by the state of indiana during the year ended higher charter costs  including fuel costs  experienced at vacations hawaii  our hawaiian travel agency  were the primary reasons that adjusted ebitda at the downtown properties declined for compared to heavier marketing and promotional spending at the stardust due to the competition on the las vegas strip was the primary factor that caused a decline in the property s adjusted ebitda 
consolidated operating income consolidated operating income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the primary reason for the decline in consolidated operating income is the decline in wholly owned property adjusted ebitda discussed above 
partially offsetting the decline in consolidated operating income was a decrease in operating loss from borgata 
the operations from borgata nearly offset their preopening expenses for our share of operating loss from borgata for only includes our share of borgata s preopening expenses 
consolidated operating income during the year includes million of preopening expenses that related mainly to delta downs  as well as our unsuccessful efforts related to a potential rhode island casino 
in addition  during  we recorded a million loss on assets held for sale as we reduced the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
although sam s town tunica reported adjusted ebitda of million for  the property experienced an operating loss of million for as compared to an operating loss of million for our new management team at sam s town tunica is continuing to attempt to build market share while controlling associated costs in an effort to return sam s town tunica to profitable operations 
we are continuing to implement new programs and systems relating to marketing and promotions and are attempting to efficiently utilize all of our hotel rooms  including the rooms acquired from isle of capri in october  to benefit our casino revenues and profitability 
however  due to the negative trend of increasing operating losses from to  we have tested the assets of sam s town tunica for recoverability pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for the 
table of contents impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the asset recoverability test requires estimating sam s town tunica s undiscounted future cash flows and comparing that aggregate total to the property s carrying value 
as the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value  we do not believe sam s town tunica s assets to be impaired at this time 
however  we will continue to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica as well as continue to update our asset recoverability test under sfas no 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash writedown of its assets which would likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the stardust experienced an operating loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to operating income of million for if the stardust continues to produce operating losses without the prospect of becoming profitable  we will be subject to the asset recoverability test under sfas no 
and may be subject to a non cash writedown of our assets which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
other non operating costs and expenses other non operating costs and expenses are primarily comprised of interest expense  net of capitalized interest 
for the years ended december  and  net interest expense was million and million  respectively 
these amounts are net of capitalized interest of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and interest expense was higher during due mainly to a decline in capitalized interest during also impacting interest expense during were lower average outstanding debt balances  declines in interest rates due to our fixed rate debt refinancings that occurred during and declines in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
in addition  as a result of our interest rate swaps outstanding during the periods  our interest expense during and was million and million  respectively  less than the contractual rate of the hedged debt 
in addition  other non operating costs and expenses include our share of borgata s non operating expenses 
during the year ended december   borgata s non operating expenses were primarily comprised of interest expense that was partially offset by a state tax benefit that is related to the recognition of operating loss carryforwards accumulated during borgata s development period 
this net tax benefit was partially offset by state tax expense resulting from borgata s operations 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million loss on the early retirement of debt related to the purchase and cancellation of approximately million original principal amount of our senior notes due and the tender and call for redemption of our senior subordinated notes due  partially offset by the adjusted basis of certain hedged debt as a result of fair value hedge terminations 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the quarter ended march   in connection with the initial application of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we reported an million charge as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to write down the remaining goodwill balance related to the acquisition of the stardust

the decline in sam s town las vegas gaming revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due primarily to due to the competitive environment on the boulder strip  reduced or eliminated operations in marginally profitable or unprofitable revenue centers and reduced promotional programs 
the decline in stardust s gaming revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the decrease in las vegas tourism resulting after the attacks of september  and the competitive environment on the las vegas strip  as well as management s efforts to reduce or eliminate operations in marginally profitable or unprofitable revenue centers 
wholly owned property adjusted ebitda wholly owned property adjusted ebitda increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to the commencement of slot operations at delta downs as well as dockside operations at blue chip 
in addition  adjusted ebitda at sam s town las vegas increased  despite a decline in gaming revenues  due primarily to cost management programs principally in the areas of marketing and payroll costs 
while delta downs revenue exceeded our initial expectations  high marketing and promotional expenses have kept adjusted ebitda margins lower than expected for the year ended december  we are exploring enhancing the facility to improve delta downs performance  including considering the addition of hotel rooms 
see expansion projects and pending shreveport acquisition and coast casinos merger delta downs for expansion plans related to delta downs 
consolidated operating income consolidated operating income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the primary reason for the increase in consolidated operating income is the increase in wholly owned property adjusted ebitda as described above

in  pursuant to our adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we ceased the amortization of these assets 
see note  intangible assets and goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the cessation of amortization expense related to our goodwill and intangible license rights 
partially offsetting the increase in consolidated operating income due to the increase in wholly owned property adjusted ebitda is an increase in the operating loss from borgata for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the operating loss for borgata includes our share of its preopening expenses which increased significantly as borgata moved towards its opening date 
at december   we planned to sell certain of our assets  principally a corporate aircraft  and recorded a million loss on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  to reduce the carrying value of these assets to their estimated fair value less costs to sell

the fair value of stardust s goodwill was determined by management through the use of available and forecasted operating information as well as the use of an independent appraisal 
net income as a result of these factors discussed above  we reported net income of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities and working capital for the year ended december   we generated operating cash flow of million compared to million for the decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the decrease in our earnings before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

additional financing may not be available to us or if available  on terms favorable to us 
our ability to service our debt will be dependent on future performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 
we believe that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
however  we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we could have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  certain states laws contain restrictions on the ability to companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions 
some restrictions may prevent us from obtaining necessary capital 
see governmental gaming regulation for more information 
in addition  standard poor s rating services placed our senior secured and senior unsecured debt ratings on credit watch with negative implications  given the uncertainty about the composition of our final capital structure

our corporate credit rating and subordinated debt ratings were affirmed  with a stable outlook 
moody s investor services confirmed all of our debt ratings 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
changes to our business and the incurrence of additional indebtedness in the future could cause further downgrading of our credit rating  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as well as on our ability to raise additional indebtedness

our atlantic city joint venture development  borgata  entered into a million bank credit agreement in december in connection with this bank credit agreement  we entered into an unlimited completion guaranty  pursuant to which we agreed to guaranty the performance of certain obligations of borgata

table of contents our ability to service our contractual obligations and commitments will be dependent on our future performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
off balance sheet arrangements 
our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which mainly consist of our investment in borgata 
we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps although borgata has entered into some interest rate caps and collars 
our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investment allow us to realize the benefits of owning a full scale resort in a manner that lessens our initial investment 
we do not guaranty financing obtained by borgata  nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreement which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort  except for the million of contributions payable to borgata that did not proportionately increase our ownership of borgata

new accounting policies in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 amendment to statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
sfas no 
is applied prospectively and is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   except for sfas no 
implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june  and certain provisions relating to forward purchases and sales on securities 
based on our derivative instruments outstanding at june   the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
an issuer is required to classify a financial instrument that is within the scope of this statement as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we adopted the standard on july   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities and subsequently revised the interpretation in december fin r this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have certain characteristics 
as revised  the interpretation is now generally effective for financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after march  we currently do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies may require a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we evaluate our goodwill  intangible other long lived assets in accordance with the applications of sfas no 
related to goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
related to impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for goodwill and intangible assets  we review the carrying values on an annual basis 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
we then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying value of the asset 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model 
all recognized impairment losses  whether for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used  are recorded as operating expenses 
there are several estimates  assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long lived assets 
first  management must determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold  it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
this means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory  social and economic climates  recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal  state or local regulations  economic downturns  or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties 
during the quarter ended march   we completed the impairment testing of all of our goodwill and intangible license rights balances and recorded an million charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in order to write down the remaining goodwill balance related to the acquisition of the stardust 
in addition  sfas no 
requires periodic analysis of our goodwill and intangible assets in future accounting periods 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have tested the assets of sam s town tunica for recoverability during as the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value  we do not believe sam s town tunica s assets to be impaired at this time 
however  we will continue to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica as well as continue to update our asset recoverability test under sfas no 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash writedown of its assets which would likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
derivative instruments 
in  we created a policy aimed at managing risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings  such as interest rate risk and its potential impact on our fixed and variable rate debt 
under this policy  we may utilize derivative contracts that effectively convert our borrowings from either floating rate to fixed or fixed rate to floating 
the policy does not allow for the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to the extent we employ such financial instruments pursuant to this policy  and the instruments qualify for hedge accounting  we designate and account for them as hedged instruments 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the underlying hedged item must expose us to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce our exposure to market fluctuations throughout the 
table of contents hedged period 
if these criteria are not met  a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change 
otherwise  gains and losses are not recognized except to the extent that the hedged debt is disposed of prior to maturity or to the extent that acceptable ranges of ineffectiveness exist in the hedge 
net interest paid or received pursuant to the financial instrument is included in interest expense in the period 
at december   we had five swaps outstanding with a total notional amount of million 
at december   we had one swap outstanding with a million notional amount 
these swaps meet the criteria for hedge accounting established by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 as well as the criteria for the shortcut method  which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there was no net impact on our consolidated statement of operations from changes in values of the hedging instruments 
instead  the fair values of the instruments are recorded as an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheets with offsetting adjustments to the carrying values of the related debt 
as such  at december   we recorded a long term liability of million on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  representing the fair market value of the swaps at december  at december   we recorded an asset of million in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  representing the fair market value of the swap as of december  the corresponding adjustments increased at december  and decreased at december  the carrying value of the long term debt item hedged  as the interest rate swaps are considered highly effective under the criteria established by gaap 
in addition  borgata  our joint venture project  has entered into derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges to either fix or maintain  within a certain range  interest rates on its floating rate debt to comply with the requirements of its bank credit agreement 
these derivative financial instruments have an initial aggregate notional amount of approximately million and cover various periods ranging from to the following table reports our share of the effects of borgata s derivative instruments for the periods indicated 
our share of the increase or decrease in fair value of certain hedges deemed to be ineffective is reported on our accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations 
our share of the increase or decrease in fair value of certain hedges deemed to be effective is reported in other comprehensive income on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets

we also utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters 
these estimates are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events and also upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market and short term and long term eurodollar rates  and its potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facility 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are based upon either the agent bank s quoted base rate or the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin that is determined by the level of a predefined financial leverage ratio 
however  the amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate from time to time 
we also attempt to manage the impact of interest rate risk on our long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for more information  see note  derivative instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we utilized interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched to specific fixed rate debt obligations 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreement outstanding at december  however  we believe that this risk is minimized because the counterparties to the swaps are existing lenders under our bank credit facility 
if we had terminated our swaps as of december   we would have paid a net amount of million based on quoted market values from the financial institutions holding the swaps 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments both debt obligations and interest rate swaps that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows by expected maturity dates for our outstanding debt at december  and related weighted average interest rates as of december  for our interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts by the contractual maturity dates and variable rates 
the notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts 
the variable rates are based upon prevailing interest rates 
the scheduled maturities of our long term debt and interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  for the years ending december are as follows year ending december  thereafter total in thousands liabilities long term debt including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps pay floating average receivable rate average est
