all of the above items are discussed in greater detail in the discussion of results of operations that follows 
results of operations operations consist of two reportable segments within the restaurant industry big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants 
revenues consist primarily of retail restaurant sales 
big boy restaurant sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators  the amounts of which total less than four percent of total revenue in all periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
total revenue also includes franchise and other fees  the amounts of which are not material to any of the periods discussed herein 
references to sales or revenue in the discussion that follows refer to restaurant sales including the minimal amounts of wholesale sales discussed above 
consolidated restaurant sales reached record heights in each of fiscal years  and fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands big boy sales golden corral sales consolidated restaurant sales changes in sales occur when new restaurants are opened and older restaurants are closed 
changes in customer counts and menu price increases contribute to changes in same store sales 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business

year fiscal fiscal big boy same store sales increases have been achieved in of the last quarters 
higher customer counts were attained throughout much of fiscal  especially during the third quarter 
severe winter weather in the third quarter of fiscal resulted in a same store sales decrease as customer counts declined 
the percent increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal was below expectation as customer counts declined  the probable result of higher gasoline prices that created lower consumer confidence 
many family dining chains experienced similar declines in sales over the same time span 
the percentage increase in dining room sales exceeded the increase in carryout and drive thru sales in each of the four quarters of fiscal  continuing a trend that was begun in the latter part of fiscal the same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent  percent and percent  respectively  during the third quarters of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal the first quarters of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal included average menu price increases of percent  percent and percent  respectively

year fiscal fiscal the fiscal declines can be traced to the sister store effect of building additional restaurants in existing markets which has caused customer counts to decline in individual restaurants 
management believes this is a short term effect that will be far outweighed with long term benefits 
following general industry practice  the same store sales comparisons include only those restaurants that were open for five full fiscal quarters prior to the start of the comparison periods 
this removes possible misleading numbers that can be caused by the great influx of customers during the first several months of operation  sometimes called the honeymoon period of a new restaurant 
using this formula  fourteen of the restaurants were included in the annualized fiscal same store sales calculation 
the quarterly calculations for fiscal included fourteen  seventeen  eighteen and nineteen restaurants respectively  in the first  second  third and fourth quarters 
the fiscal same store sales comparisons include menu price hikes of percent in the fourth quarter and percent in the second quarter 
the same store sales comparisons for the last three quarters of fiscal were largely impacted by the introduction of the great steak buffet during the second quarter along with the simultaneous launch of the company s first golden corral television commercials 
severe winter weather negatively impacted the third quarter 
the conversion of the hot bars to the great steak buffet allowed the company to begin charging an extra dollar for the basic buffet  equating to a percent average menu price increase 
the new concept features all you can eat charbroiled steaks served on the dinner buffet 
pre tax earnings for both operating segments are highlighted below also see note g to the consolidated financial statements fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands big boy pre tax earnings golden corral pre tax earnings total pre tax earnings by segment the operating percentages shown in the following table are percentages of restaurant sales as defined in a previous paragraph rather than of total revenue 
the table supplements the discussion that follows which concerns cost of sales for both the big boy and golden corral reporting segments  including food cost  payroll and other operating costs 
fiscal fiscal fiscal total big boy gc total big boy gc total big boy gc sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit significantly higher commodity costs  especially beef  dairy and pork  drove the food and paper cost percentages higher in fiscal for both big boy and golden corral 
beef  in particular  has been at record highs and continues to be a highly volatile market 
import and export restrictions can cause wide fluctuations in cost 
although beef prices have declined somewhat since december when export restrictions were imposed due to the detection of mad cow disease in a single slaughtered cow from the nation s herd  management believes that appreciably lower prices can not be expected any time soon 
most commodity prices are generally expected to continue rising in the near term  but not as rapidly as was experienced through the first half of fiscal the food and paper cost percentages for the golden corral segment are much higher than the big boy segment because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral concept  as well as its use of steak as a featured item on the buffet 
menu price hikes in fiscal helped to counter the effects of the higher cost of food to a certain degree  however  menu prices can not be raised high enough at once to offset the significant increases that have been seen on a wide range of products 
the effect of commodity price increases can also be managed with changes to the big boy menu mix and effective selection of items served on the golden corral food bar 
comparing food and paper costs for fiscal with fiscal  the percentage reduction was the result of lower prices paid for certain commodities such as beef and pork combined with the effect of menu price hikes 
self insured claims experience is reviewed and adjusted annually during the first quarter 
the assumptions used to measure these adjustments can be complex and sometimes require management to exercise considerable judgment 
however  management does not consider the adjustments made during the annual review to be critical to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition or its results of operations for any fiscal year taken as a whole 
results for fiscal and fiscal received the benefit of favorable claims experience  as self insurance liabilities were lowered by  during the first quarter of fiscal and  in the first quarter of fiscal in fiscal   was charged against earnings in the second quarter to increase the self insurance liabilities   of which was ultimately reversed in the fourth quarter 
payroll and related cost percentages moved downward in fiscal for both the big boy and golden corral operating segments  even when the benefit of the self insurance reserve adjustments discussed in the preceding paragraph that were apportioned to payroll and related costs is excluded 
the combination of big boy s same store sales increase and average pay rates moving lower was more than enough to compensate for the effects of an increase in the number of hours worked  plus higher pension and medical costs 
despite the flat change in same store sales  lower golden corral percentages were achieved for the second consecutive year with the combination of a reduction in the number of hours worked along with lower pay rates  offset somewhat by higher costs of variable compensation and medical insurance 
in fiscal  big boy s payroll percentages were higher than fiscal as lower average pay rates and higher menu prices were not enough to cover the cost of increased service hours and higher pension and medical plan costs 
although federal legislation has once again been introduced in an effort to raise the federal minimum wage  the company believes that it is unlikely to be signed into law in the near term 
if such legislation were to be enacted  the company would counter the effects with higher menu prices  together with tighter payroll standards and a reduction in hours worked 
new overtime pay rules initiated by the us department of labor are effective in august the new rules are expected to have a negligible impact on the company 
the fair value of the assets in the company s defined benefit pension plans was adversely affected by poor returns on equity investments in recent years 
the result has increased the company s pension expense after many years of steady  low costs 
the net periodic pension cost computed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
was   and  respectively  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal the weighted average discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions will remain at percent for the fiscal year that began on may  fiscal 
the net periodic pension expense for fiscal is expected to level off near fiscal s cost 
contributions to these plans were   and  respectively  during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal approximately  of fiscal s contribution was deferred to be paid in fiscal other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  opening costs and many other restaurant operating expenses 
as most of these expenses tend to be more fixed in nature  same store sales increases cause these costs to be a lower percentage of sales  as reflected in the above table for big boy 
the big boy percentage reduction for fiscal was greater than the fiscal reduction due to the percent same store sales increase in fiscal combined with certain write offs recorded in fiscal for the cost of abandoning design plans for an earlier big boy prototype building 
below par golden corral same store sales in both fiscal and fiscal caused other operating costs to be a higher percentage of sales than fiscal in addition  certain equipment write offs were recorded in fiscal in connection with the introduction of the great steak buffet 
opening costs had a significant impact on the percentages as well 
charges for big boy restaurants for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
results for fiscal were favorably affected by credits to impairment of assets totaling  that resulted from the dispositions of two former big boy restaurants 
the credits reflect the over estimation of impairment charges recorded when the restaurants were permanently closed in fiscal no impairments of assets were recorded during fiscal or fiscal interest expense during fiscal decreased  or percent lower than fiscal  but was  higher than fiscal accounting for much of the change is the effect of interest required to be capitalized  which was   and  respectively  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal also  the weighted average fixed interest rate on the company s term loans has moved lower reflecting the mix of loans added during the last eighteen months at rates lower than older higher rate loans  the principal of which is now amortizing much more rapidly 
interest expense is expected to rise in fiscal reflecting the full effect of having borrowed  in fiscal and  thus far in fiscal in addition  interest rates are likely to rise 
significant payments against the term loans should help to counter the effect of the additional borrowing 
income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal these rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips 
to a lesser degree  the company also uses the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc 
although wotc expired on december   congress is expected to soon extend it once again 
the effective tax rate for fiscal would likely increase if wotc is not restored by congress 
critical accounting policies two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management believes that its policy used in accounting for the impairment of long lived assets is the company s only critical accounting policy because of its potential for significant impact on financial condition and results of operations 
a discussion of this policy can be found under the property and equipment caption of note a to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources restaurant sales provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all restaurant sales are received in cash or credit cards 
net earnings plus depreciation provide the primary source of cash provided by operating activities 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against the company s credit lines  proceeds from employees exercising of stock options and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion and dividends 
the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations  and credit lines are readily available  the use of this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of may  shown in the table below 
payments due by period in thousands aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments may  total year year year year year more than years long term debt rent due under capital lease obligations rent due under operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations none total contractual cash obligations not included are certain leases of former operating properties that the company has assigned or sub let to third parties 
the average annual obligations of these leases approximate over the next five years 
the company remains contingently liable for the performance of these leases 
in the event of default by the assignees or sub lessees  the company generally retains the right to re assign or re sublet the properties 
the working capital deficit was  as of may  the working capital deficit is likely to increase over the next few years at a modest  manageable pace as construction debt is prudently increased to supplement the use of internally generated cash to finance expansion plans 
including draws since may    had been cumulatively borrowed against the company s  construction draw credit facility  leaving  available to be drawn upon before the facility is scheduled to expire on september   unless extended 
additionally  a  working capital revolving line of credit currently unused is readily available if needed 
operating cash flows were  in fiscal   higher than fiscal and  above fiscal the increases are attributable to the combination of higher net earnings  fiscal s credit to impairment of assets  increases in accounts payable and lower income tax payments resulting from federal bonus depreciation rules 
capital spending is the principal component of investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal  an increase of  from fiscal this year s capital spending includes  for golden corral restaurants  principally for new restaurant construction and site acquisitions 
also included in the capital costs was  spent on big boy restaurants  consisting of new restaurant construction  a site acquisition  remodeling existing restaurants including kitchen and dining room expansions  routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays 
it is the company s policy to own the land on which it builds new restaurants  however  it is sometimes necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
four of the golden corral restaurants now in operation have been built on leased land 
another golden corral ground lease has been entered into for a restaurant to open in calendar year in addition  a big boy that opened in january was built upon leased land 
all of these leases have been accounted for as operating leases pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended 
also included in investing activities for fiscal is the recovery of  received in settlement of certain litigation relating to defective construction of a golden corral restaurant 
a golden corral restaurant that opened in january was the replacement of a defective restaurant building in canton  ohio 
the defective building had originally been expected to be placed in service in september its construction was halted in august when structural defects were discovered 
the company asserted claims against certain firms with which the company had contracted for the design  engineering and construction of the defective building 
claims against the architect and the architect s structural engineering consultant were resolved in july the defendants agreed to pay the company  as a full settlement 
receipt of the settlement funds was sufficient to recover all construction costs incurred  including the cost to raze the defective building 
the company continues to prosecute its claim exceeding  against the general contractor that built the building 
financing activities in fiscal included  of new debt borrowed against the company s credit lines 
in addition   was borrowed shortly after the end of fiscal scheduled and other payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  during fiscal regular quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled  including dividends of 
per share in july  
in october  
in january and 
in april the percent increase in the dividend rate was the board of directors recognition of the company s stronger results and optimistic outlook 
cash dividends paid per share to the company s shareholders have increased in each of the last six years 
as the company expects to continue its year practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends  the board of directors declared another 
per share dividend on june  also included in financing activities in fiscal are proceeds of  from employees and directors who acquired  shares of the company s common stock through exercise of stock options granted under the company s stock option plan 
as of may    shares remain outstanding under the plan  including  fully vested shares at a weighted average price per share of  and  shares were available to be optioned 
shareholders approved the stock option and incentive plan in october the maximum number of shares that the new plan may issue is  as of may   no awards had been granted under the stock option and incentive plan 
no shares have been acquired under the company s current stock repurchase program  which authorizes the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock through october the current price at which shares of the company s common stock are being traded does not warrant the utilization of the program 
two big boy restaurants were under construction as of may  costs remaining to complete construction of both restaurants were estimated at  as of may  the approximate cost to build and equip a new big boy restaurant ranges from  to  depending on land cost 
approximately one fifth of the company s big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year 
the cost of remodeling to be completed in fiscal is estimated at  in addition  certain high volume big boy restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  the company s original development agreements with golden corral franchising systems  inc called for opening golden corral restaurants by december  the company is in compliance with these development agreements 
the new agreement reached in july allows the company to build additional restaurants by december   including new markets in pennsylvania  west virginia and michigan 
twenty six restaurants were in operation as of may  the combined build out plan calls for three more to be opened by december   five will be opened each year through december   with the final three to be built in two golden corral restaurants were under construction as of may  costs remaining to complete construction of these two restaurants were estimated at  as of may  construction of three more golden corrals is scheduled to be completed over the next twelve months 
on average  the cost to build and equip each golden corral restaurant is approximately  including land 
five of the company s original golden corral restaurants that opened in and have reached the age that warrants remodeling 
the work will be completed in fiscal at a cost exceeding  per restaurant 
the company expects to complete its plan to replace its headquarters legacy information systems with an integrated enterprise system in september capitalized costs through may  were approximately  including the capitalized value of employees time and capitalized interest aggregating  the cash outlay to complete the project was estimated at  as of may  risk factors and safe harbor statement statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as that item is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements can generally be identified in sentences that contain words such as should  could  will  may  plans  expect  anticipate  estimate  project  intend  believe and similar words that are used to convey the fact that the statement being made is prospective and does not strictly relate to historical or present facts 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements that may be contained in this md a 
food safety is the most significant risk to any company that operates in the restaurant industry 
it has become the focus of increased government regulatory initiatives at the local  state and federal levels resulting in higher compliance costs to the company 
to limit the company s exposure to the risk of food contamination  management rigorously emphasizes and enforces the company s food safety policies in all of the company s restaurants  and at the commissary and food manufacturing plant that the company operates for big boy restaurants 
these policies are designed to work cooperatively with programs established by health agencies at all levels of government authority  including the federal hazard analysis of critical control points haccp program 
in addition  the company makes use of servsafe training  a nationally recognized program developed by the national restaurant association 
the servsafe program provides accurate  up to date science based information to all levels of restaurant workers on all aspects of food handling  from receiving and storing to preparing and serving 
all restaurant managers are required to receive re certification in servsafe training every five years 
in december  the united states department of agriculture usda recalled meat products in several western states that were connected to a single slaughtered cow in which mad cow disease had been detected 
the company believes there is no risk to its customers 
according to the usda  the nation s beef supply remains safe because research shows that mad cow disease infects brain and spinal cord tissue which was removed during the slaughter of the single diseased cow 
it is believed that these tissue parts did not enter the human food supply 
other examples of risks and uncertainties facing the company include  but are not limited to  the following intense competition for customers  consumer perceptions of value  food quality and quality of service  changing consumer preferences  particularly based on concerns with nutritional content of the company s food or restaurant food in general  changing neighborhood demographics  changes in business strategy and development plans  the rising cost of quality sites on which to build restaurants  poor selection of restaurant sites  changes in the supply and cost of food  the effects of other inflationary pressures  especially higher costs for health care benefits and energy prices  rolling power outages  shortages of qualified labor  seasonal weather conditions  particularly during the winter months of the third quarter  natural disasters  fires or explosions  criminal acts  including bomb threats  robberies  hostage taking  kidnapping and other violent crimes  acts of terrorists or acts of war  civil disturbances  boycotts  variable interest rates  limitations on borrowing capacity  legal claims  changes in accounting standards  estimates used in preparing financial statements  disruptions to the business during transitions to new computer software  financial stability of technology vendors to support computer software over the long term  unauthorized access to information systems  changes in governmental regulations regarding the environment  exposure to penalties for potential violations of numerous governmental regulations in general  and immigration i and minor labor regulations in particular  any future imposition by osha of costly ergonomics regulations on workplace safety  legislative changes affecting labor law  especially increases in the federal minimum wage  and legislation or court rulings that result in changes to tax codes 
the company continually takes reasonable preventive measures to reduce its risks and uncertainties 
however  the nature of some risks and uncertainties leaves the company with little control 
the materialization of any of the risks and uncertainties identified herein  together with those risks not specifically listed or those that are presently unforeseen  could result in significant adverse effects on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows  which could include the permanent closure of the affected restaurant s with an impairment of assets charge taken against earnings 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has market risk exposure to interest rate changes primarily relating to its  bullet loan 
interest rates are presently determined by adding basis points to the london interbank offered rate libor 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use foreign currency 
food supplies for big boy restaurants are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers 
quality and price are the principal determinants of source 
centralized purchasing and food preparation through the company s commissary ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and results in lower food and supply costs 
certain commodities  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing 
except for items such as fresh produce and dairy products that are purchased from any number of local suppliers  the company currently purchases substantially all food  beverage and other menu items for use in its golden corral restaurants from the same vendor that golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor uses for its operations 
deliveries are made two or three times per week 
other vendors are available to provide products that meet the franchisor s specifications at comparable prices should the company wish or need to make a change
