for a discussion of the important risks related to our business and future operating performance  see the discussion under the caption item business risks related to our business and under the caption factors which may influence future results of operations below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
overview and background we are a provider of wireless broadband access solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market 
our broad range of products includes wireless data modems and software for laptop pcs  embedded wireless modules for original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and ruggedized wireless data modems for public safety and telemetry applications 
through the integration of our hardware and software  our products are designed to operate on a majority of global wireless networks and provide mobile subscribers with secure and convenient access to data including corporate  public and personal information through the internet and enterprise networks 
we also offer software engineering and design services to our customers to facilitate the use of our products 
historically  we have incurred substantial costs to develop our technology and products  and to recruit and train personnel for our product development and sales and marketing departments 
in the past  our operating expenses have exceeded the revenue generated by our products and services 
as a result  we have incurred losses in each quarter since inception 
during  we incurred a net loss applicable to common shareholders of million see reconciliation of net loss to net loss applicable to common shareholders in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and working capital of million 
since our inception in  we have been focused on the development and commercialization of technologies that allow for wireless access to data 
we expanded our operations in advance of the launch of several new products in the late s through beginning in  in response to the decline in the telecommunications industry  we implemented an operational and organizational restructuring to increase operating efficiency and conserve working capital 
these restructuring activities included facility consolidations  reduction of employee staff  consultants and temporary labor and critical assessments of asset impairment and obsolete inventory 
for  and  we incurred restructuring and impairment charges of approximately  million and million  respectively 
beginning in early  we also began aggressively pursuing the development of innovative g products  refocused our research and development efforts on sales driven customer needs and focused our sales  marketing and distribution efforts on large wireless operators and related companies 
these efforts have contributed to an increase in our gross margin from a negative million for to a positive gross margin of million in  and an improvement in our gross margin as a percentage of total revenue from negative in to positive in we also reduced our operating loss from million for to an operating loss of million for 
table of contents factors which may influence future results of operations we intend to continue executing on a plan to improve our operating results and financial condition 
the plan includes strengthening sales initiatives  improving gross margins and continuing to cut other costs as a percentage of sales 
we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer contracts for the development and supply of our products and this may place significant demands on our resources 
revenue 
we believe that our revenue growth will be influenced largely by the speed and breadth of the increase in demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g products and g data access services  particularly in europe  north america and asia  customer acceptance for our new products that address these markets  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following demand for broadband access to networks  use of the internet  rate of change to new products  loss of significant customers  drop in demand for cdma and umts gprs products  and change in technologies 
we began shipping our first g products in december and anticipate introducing additional g products in in the future  we also expect to enter into customer contracts for development services  but not at significant levels in relation to total revenue 
cost of revenue 
we currently outsource all of our manufacturing operations to lg innotek 
all costs associated with lg innotek are included in our cost of revenue 
cost of revenue also includes warranty costs  royalty payments based on a percentage of revenue  operations group expenses  costs related to development services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
during   and  we recorded inventory write downs of million  million  and million  respectively  due to the decrease in demand for our products 
during  we sold million in inventory that had previously been written down 
we expect to continue to outsource our manufacturing operations  and as our business grows we expect our manufacturing activity to increase 
operating expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in europe  north america and asia 
if these markets continue to grow as expected  we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased research and development expenses associated with such new product development 
we have in the past and expect to continue in future periods to incur these expenses in periods prior to recognizing revenue from these contracts 
in addition  the portion of our revenue derived from international sales may increase  requiring an expansion of our sales and marketing efforts in these markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete balances  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  the use of option pricing models to establish values of equity instruments issued in non monetary transactions with non employees  useful lives and realizability of long lived assets and estimates for costs recorded in restructuring accruals 

table of contents revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from the sale of our broadband wireless access solutions to wireless operators  oem customers  vars and distributors 
revenue from product sales services is recognized upon the latest of transfer of title or shipment of the product to the customer 
we record deferred revenue for cash payments received from customers in advance of product shipments 
we establish reserves for estimated product returns allowances in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future product returns  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated return policies and practices and our historical trends 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is consistent with sec guidance and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for our fixed price development services contracts  we recognize revenue as services are rendered using labor output measures or the achievement of milestones as indicators of progress 
total estimated costs are based on management s assessment of costs to complete the project including periodic assessments of the progress achieved and the costs expended to date 
to the extent that our estimated costs materially change  our revenue and profit recorded under the associated contract is adjusted accordingly 
if total costs of completion are estimated to exceed the contract value  a loss is recognized in the period the loss is identified 
during  we entered into a joint development agreement containing multiple elements with one of our customers including development services and product shipments 
accordingly  we have separated the deliverables into units of accounting and allocated arrangement consideration on these deliverables in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with eift issue no 
 million in cash payments received in were deferred and will be recognized in revenue when products are shipped or as development services are performed in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  changes in customer payment cycles  and our customer s credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual doubtful accounts and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand as discussed under revenues above  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
we believe that the estimates we use in calculating the inventory reserve are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially different from our estimates  adjustments to our inventory reserve may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one or two year coverage for products following the date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage at the time the sale is recorded 
in 
table of contents estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency of claims and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual warranty costs 
we have not experienced significant warranty expenses to date 
future expenses could be different  depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing quality 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the impairment of intangible and long lived assets which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances  the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to the fair value  which is determined using a discounted cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
no impairment was recorded in during  we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of  for a software license that was no longer being used as a result of our decision not to pursue further development of the technology related to this license 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our intangible and long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over relatively short periods  typically three to five years 
this reduces the risk of large impairment charges in any given period 
however  most of these assets are associated with technology that changes rapidly and such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 
accrued restructuring related costs 
we estimate amounts for direct costs of our expenses and liabilities related to our restructurings in accordance with the eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
for restructurings initiated after december   we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the restructuring accrual requires the use of estimates including the amounts of future lease obligations offset by estimated sublease income 
due to our inability to sublease certain facilities  we revised our estimates of future sublease income and recorded additional restructuring charges in  and we believe that our assumptions and estimates utilized in the determination of the restructuring accrual were appropriate based on the information available to management 
future revisions  if any  in our estimates of the potential costs or sublease income could materially impact our results of operations and financial position

liquidity and capital resources we have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products 
these costs have exceeded total revenue and we have sustained substantial losses from operations in each period since our inception and have used substantially all of our available cash resources to fund operations 
during  we incurred a net loss of million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  working capital of million and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have funded our operations primarily through sales of our equity and debt securities  and to a lesser extent through capital lease arrangements and borrowings under our line of credit 
to date  net proceeds from these transactions have totaled approximately million  including net proceeds from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of of million  net proceeds of approximately million from the private placement of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock in december  net proceeds of approximately million from the common stock private placement in september  and net proceeds of million from the private placement of series b convertible preferred stock in  including the related convertible notes and common stock purchase warrants

current sources of capital and liquidity as of december   we had working capital of million and approximately million in cash and cash equivalents 
in january  we completed the private placement of  shares of common stock and common stock purchase warrants resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
we are party to an accounts receivable purchase facility with a bank which allows us to borrow up to the lesser of million or of certain eligible accounts receivable balances 
this facility bears interest at per month when utilized 
the facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under this facility

the following table displays the activity and balances of the restructuring accrual from january  to december  employee termination facility consolidation asset impairments total balance january  charges cash payments asset impairments balance december  charges cash payments foreign exchange loss balance december  
table of contents our outstanding shares of series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock do not require the payment of cash dividends 
our series a preferred stock includes a redemption feature effective on the seventh anniversary of its issuance december and each of our series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock is redeemable upon a change of control of the company  including the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of more than of our voting power 
however  our authorized capital includes unissued blank check preferred stock  the issuance of which may be approved by our board of directors without the prior consent of our stockholders and which can be used to effectively prevent a change of control 
as a result  we do not expect to redeem any of our series a or series b preferred stock in the foreseeable future 
however  in the event our board of directors approves a merger or does not otherwise act to prevent a change of control through the use of our authorized and unissued preferred stock  the redemption features could be triggered 
as of december   our total redemption obligation would have equaled million 
we believe that our available cash reserves  including net proceeds of approximately million received in january in connection with our recent private placement  together with our budgeted operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund operations  including the expansion of our sales and marketing team  the further development of our new products and the related increase in our general and administrative expenses  and to satisfy our working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we expect that one of our significant sources of funds in the future will be our operating cash flow 
our future revenue is dependent on us fulfilling our commitments in accordance with agreements with a small number of major customers 
our liquidity could be impaired if there is any interruption to our business operations or a failure to generate additional revenue from new or existing products 
backlog we believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to the large volume of products delivered to wireless operators  who in turn sell our products to their customers  and our dependency on evolving wireless network standards 
therefore  we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
changes the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  could be classified as equity or mezzanine equity 
sfas no 
requires those instruments to be classified as liabilities or assets in some circumstances in the statement of financial position 
further  sfas no 
requires disclosure regarding the terms of those instruments and settlement alternatives 
the guidance in sfas no 
is generally effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and is otherwise effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  for financial instruments created before the issuance date of sfas no 
and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption  transition shall be achieved by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle by initially measuring the financial instruments at fair value or other measurement attribute required by this statement 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies the financial accounting and reporting requirements  originally established in sfas no 
 for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
provides greater clarification of the characteristics of a derivative instrument so that contracts with similar characteristics will be accounted for consistently 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   as well as for hedging relationships designated after june   excluding certain implementation issues that have been effective prior to this date under sfas no 
the adoption of this statement has not had any impact on our operating results or financial position 

table of contents in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses how to determine whether a revenue arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting for the purposes of revenue recognition and how the revenue arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
applies to revenue arrangements entered into after june  we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
as of july  and have applied the provisions to our subsequent joint development and supply agreements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december  our cash and short term investments totaled million 
we generally place our cash and short term investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the income we earn on our investments and therefore impact our cash flows and results of operations 
borrowings under our accounts receivable purchase facility with silicon valley bank bear interest at a variable rate based on the us prime rate of interest 
as of december  we owed no amounts under this facility 
foreign currency exchange rate risk substantially all of our sales to date have been denominated in us dollars 
as a result  we do not experience any significant foreign currency gains or losses related to our revenues 
in  however  approximately of our revenue was derived from transactions with customers outside the united states and we expect this percentage to grow in to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products relatively more expensive in international markets 

table of contents a portion of our expenses  exclusively related to our r d facility in calgary  alberta  canada  are denominated in canadian dollars while our functional currency is the us dollar 
in  as a result of the appreciation of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  we realized foreign currency losses of approximately  in the event the canadian dollar continues to appreciate in we will experience additional foreign currency losses 
holding all other variables constant and on a hypothetical basis  a further increase in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar over would result in approximately  in foreign currency losses for the year 
conversely  a decrease over would result in approximately  in foreign currency gains for the year 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and although we have never used financial hedging techniques to date  we may use them in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that these fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in the future
