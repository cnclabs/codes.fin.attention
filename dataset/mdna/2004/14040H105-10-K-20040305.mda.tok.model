technology systems technology has been a cornerstone of ibs 
we leverage information technology to develop and deliver innovative products and services to satisfy our customers needs 
a key part of our strategic focus is the development of efficient  flexible computer and operational systems to support complex marketing and account management strategies

consequently  we continuously review capabilities and develop or obtain systems  processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements 
funding and liquidity a discussion of our funding programs and liquidity has been included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funding on pages competition each of our card products is marketed to specific consumer populations across the credit spectrum 
the terms of each card product are actively managed to achieve a balance between risk and expected performance 
for example  card product terms typically include the ability to reprice individual accounts upwards or downwards based on the customer s payment and other performance 
in addition  since  we have aggressively marketed low non introductory rate cards to consumers with low risk and established credit profiles to take advantage of the favorable risk return characteristics of this consumer type 
industry competitors have continuously solicited our customers with these and other similar interest rate strategies 
management believes the competition has put  and will continue to put  additional pressure on our pricing strategies 
as a marketer of credit card and other financial products  we face intense competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non bank providers of financial services 
many of these companies are substantially larger and have more resources than we do 
we compete with international  national  regional and local issuers of visa and mastercard credit cards 
in addition  american express  discover card  diner s club and  to a certain extent  smart cards and debit cards  represent additional competition to the general purpose credit card 
in general  customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price  credit limit and other product features  and customer loyalty is often limited

additionally  we face competition from a small  but growing number of online automobile finance providers

there can be no assurance  however  that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate yield on our loans will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop 
in addition  some of our competitors may be substantially larger than we are  which may give those competitors advantages  including a more diversified product and customer base  operational efficiencies and more versatile technology platforms 
these competitors may also consolidate with other financial institutions in ways that enhance these advantages

our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information 
in addition  our competitors also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry 
the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete 
conversely  our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts  or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results
