item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  and the related notes to consolidated financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy  and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements  but we cannot guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development  and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses  and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in this report using accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements 
we must make judgments  estimates  and in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives as we apply these rules and requirements 
the most critical estimates and accounting policies include estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  the related standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  and the use of successful efforts accounting method for oil and gas expenditures 
the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of our oil and gas properties and the impairment of those properties are affected by the estimated oil and gas reserves and the successful efforts method of accounting 
in addition  we use multiple estimated data to compute and record our asset retirement obligations 
finally  our general and administrative expenses are affected by the method in which we measure and record stock based compensation expense and  to a lesser extent  assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans 
we have included a more detailed discussion of these critical estimates and accounting policies in the following sections of this item long term strategy and business developments  liquidity and capital resources  and results of operations 
our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report also have a more comprehensive discussion of our significant accounting policies 
long term strategy and business developments our long term strategy is to increase our oil and gas reserves and production while keeping our finding and development costs and operating costs on a per mcf equivalent mcfe basis competitive with our industry peers 
we will implement this strategy through drilling exploratory and development wells from our inventory of available prospects that we have evaluated for geologic and mechanical risk and future reserve or resource potential 
our drilling program will contain some high risk high reserve potential opportunities as well as some lower risk lower reserve potential opportunities  in order to achieve a balanced program of reserve and production growth 
success of this strategy is contingent on various risk factors  as discussed in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
over the last three years  we have invested million in oil and gas properties  found bcfe of proved reserves and replaced of our production at an average finding and development cost of per mcfe 
the following table reflects our results during the last three years 
increase increase decrease decrease production oil mbbls    gas mmcf    total mmcfe    proved reserves oil mbbls    gas mmcf    total mmcfe    operating costs per mcfe finding and development costs per mcfe percentage of production replaced barrels of oil are converted to mcf equivalents mcfe at the ratio of barrel of oil equals mcf of gas 
finding and development costs include acquisition  development and exploration costs including exploration costs such as seismic acquisition costs 
reserves sold bcfe in are excluded from this calculation 
the implementation of our long term strategy requires that we continually incur significant capital expenditures in order to replace current production and find and develop new oil and gas reserves 
in order to finance our capital and exploration program  we depend on cash flow from operations or bank debt and equity offerings as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
operating costs on a mcfe produced basis have increased slightly over the past three years from to or approximately 
finding and development costs have increased from per mcfe in to per mcfe in these increased costs reflect the difficulty of finding new reserves in the offshore gulf of mexico shelf environment 
these higher costs also reflect negative reserve revisions that have occurred in and these negative revisions were the result of certain reservoirs performing at rates lower than anticipated by our independent reserve engineers 
if the reserve revisions are removed from the finding and development cost calculations  annual finding and development costs and percentage of production replaced would have been as follows finding and development costs percentage of production replaced although we and our independent reservoir engineers utilize accepted engineering techniques to evaluate the future performance of reservoirs  variations in these estimates can and will occur 
proved reserve estimates while parts of our long term strategy such as increased production or operating costs per mcfe can be accurately measured by reference to actual data  other measurements such as an increase in oil and gas reserves or finding costs per mcfe rely heavily on estimated information  subject to later revisions 
in addition  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relies on these estimates of oil and gas reserves using commodity prices and costs at year end 
independent reserve engineers prepare the estimates of our oil and gas reserves using guidelines put forth under gaap and by the securities and exchange commission 
the quality and quantity of data  the interpretation of the data  and the accuracy of mandated economic assumptions combined with the judgment exercised by the reserve engineers affect the accuracy of the estimated reserves 
in addition  drilling or production results after the date of the estimate may cause material revisions to the reserve estimates 
in our year end reserve report we used december   west texas intermediate posted price of per barrel and a gulf coast spot market price of per mmbtu adjusted by property for energy content  quality  transportation fees  and regional price differentials 
we estimated the costs based on the prior year costs incurred for individual properties or similar properties if a particular property did not have production during the prior year 
while we believe that future costs can be reasonably estimated  future prices are difficult to estimate since the market prices are influenced by events beyond our control 
future global economic and political events will most likely result in significant fluctuations in future oil prices 
in addition  cold weather during december and into the first quarter of in the united states has resulted in significant fluctuations in natural gas prices 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   increased by million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to a increase in production and an increase in oil and gas prices throughout the entire year 
we expect our cash flow provided by operations for to increase because of higher projected production from new properties  combined with oil and gas prices consistent with and steady operating  general and administrative  interest and financing costs per mcfe 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in working capital accounts 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico will shut down our production for the duration of the storm s presence in the gulf  or as in the case of hurricane lili in  damage production facilities so that we cannot produce from a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines in the gulf of mexico can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time 
our realized oil and gas prices vary due to world political events  supply and demand of products  product storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production usually less than through the use of forward sale agreements 
currently we have no such arrangements in place 
see additional discussion under commodity price risk in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in our working capital accounts from to include an increase in our accounts receivable a decrease in our cash flow provided by operations due to higher oil and gas prices  increased production and increased balances due from our joint interest participants as a result of increased operating activities drilling wells and facilities construction at year end 
due to the increase in operating activities our accounts payable balance increased by million which increased our cash flow from operations 
cash flow provided by operations also increased due to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily because of a decrease in prepaid drilling costs on non operated properties 
we incurred capital and exploration expenditures totaling million during the capital expenditures included million for leasehold acquisition  million for exploration costs  million for development costs including platform and facilities construction 
during the year  we built and installed  or will install in  offshore platforms and facilities 
in addition  in we drilled exploration wells and development wells and had wells in progress at year end 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have budgeted million for capital and exploration expenditures in our capital and exploration budget includes million for exploratory wells 
we project that we will spend million on wells in the gulf of mexico and million on onshore wells in south texas and mississippi 
the budget also includes million for platforms and development drilling 
the remaining million will be allocated to leasehold acquisitions  seismic acquisitions  and workovers 
if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the exploratory success and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing and or offerings of debt or equity securities 
effective may   we agreed with our lenders to increase our borrowing base from million to million and to extend the maturity of the loan facility from may  to may  as of december   we had million borrowed under the facility 
the banks review the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit 
additionally  we have agreed not to pay dividends 
the most significant financial covenants in the line of credit include maintaining a minimum current ratio as defined in the agreement of to  a minimum tangible net worth of million plus of net income accumulated from the inception of the agreement and of any non redeemable preferred or common stock offerings  and interest coverage of to we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants 
if we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
on june   we filed a shelf registration statement to issue up to million of common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  and or warrants 
the securities and exchange commission declared the shelf registration statement effective december  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations bank debt   purchase commitments   office lease  total    on december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by million 
our current ratio was to 
results of operations in  we achieved net income totaling million or basic income per share  and diluted income per share  compared to a net income of million or basic income per share and diluted income per share in the increase in net income resulted primarily from increased oil and gas production and sales prices 
in addition to oil and gas production and prices  certain accounting policies discussed below can cause our net income to vary significantly from period to period because of events or circumstances which trigger recognition of expenses for unsuccessful wells or impairments of properties 
further  we calculated certain expenses using estimates of oil and gas reserves that can vary significantly 
oil and gas sales revenue the following table discloses the net oil and gas production volumes  sales  and sales prices for each of the three years ended december    and increase increase decrease decrease oil production volume mbbls    oil sales revenue    price per bbl increase in oil sales revenue due to change in prices   change in production volume   total increase decrease in oil sales revenue   gas production volume mmcf    gas sales revenue    price per mcf increase decrease in gas sales revenue due to change in prices   change in production volume   total increase decrease in gas sales revenue   oil sales revenue during increased by million  or  compared to because average oil prices increased by per barrel  or and oil production increased by  barrels  or 
during  oil sales revenue increased by million  or  compared to because oil production increased by  barrels  or  and average oil prices increased by or 
the increase in oil production came primarily from new properties in the offshore gulf of mexico partially offset by natural depletion of the existing producing properties in the gulf coast area and the sale of certain properties in south texas in april gas sales revenue during increased by million or compared to because of higher average gas prices and increased production 
average gas prices increased from per mcf in to per mcf  or  in  causing gas sales revenues to increase by million 
production increased by bcf  or  primarily because of gas production from new properties in the offshore gulf of mexico 
during  gas sales revenue decreased by million  or because of lower average gas prices and lower production 
average gas prices decreased from per mcf in to per mcf  or  in  causing gas sales revenues to decrease by million 
production decreased by bcf  or  primarily because of lower gas production from the offshore gulf of mexico 
during the fourth quarter of we lost production from a well on east cameron block the production from this property during was bcf compared to bcf during the decrease in production from this property was partially offset by increased gas production from new offshore properties 
during  we sold certain south texas properties at a million gain 
this gain in accounts for the decrease in other income during when compared to and the increase in when compared to operating costs and expenses total operating costs during increased by million  or  compared to  due to the increase in the number of operating properties 
however  operating costs per mcfe increased by only to during the following table presents the major components of our operating costs on a per mcfe basis 
years ending december  total per mcfe total per mcfe total per mcfe direct operating expense    overhead workovers    advalorum taxes production taxes  transportation    total    exploration expenses successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies choose one of two acceptable accounting methods  successful efforts or full cost 
the most significant difference between the two methods relates to the accounting treatment of drilling costs for unsuccessful exploration wells dry holes and exploration costs 
under the successful efforts method  we recognize exploration costs and dry hole costs as expenses when incurred and capitalize the costs of successful exploration wells as oil and gas properties 
entities that follow the full cost method capitalize all drilling and exploration costs including dry hole costs into one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
we use the successful efforts method because we believe that it more accurately reflects on our balance sheet historical costs that have future value 
however  using successful efforts often causes our income statement to fluctuate significantly between reporting periods based on our drilling success or failure during the periods 
during  exploration expenses increased by million  or  compared to primarily because of a million increase in dry hole costs 
in addition  geological and geophysical expenses increased by  because of higher seismic expenses in compared to exploration expenses for increased by million  or  because of increased dry hole costs compared to  partially offset by a million decrease in seismic expenses in it is typical for companies that drill a significant number of exploration wells  as we do  to incur dry hole costs 
during the last three years we have drilled exploration wells  of which were considered dry holes resulting in a success ratio on exploratory wells 
our dry hole costs charged to expense during this period totaled million out of total exploratory drilling costs of million 
it is impossible to accurately predict specific dry holes  however  based on past experience  we estimate that between and of our exploration wells and exploration drilling costs will be dry holes 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization of oil and gas properties and asset retirement obligations we calculate depletion  depreciation  and amortization expense dd a using the estimates of proved oil and gas reserves 
we segregate the costs for individual or contiguous properties or projects and record dd a of these property costs separately using the units of production method 
downward revisions in reserves increase the dd a per unit and reduce our net income  likewise  upward revisions lower the dd a per unit and increase our net income 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense recorded in increased by million  or  compared to the prior year 
on a per mcfe basis  depreciation  depletion and amortization per mcfe increased to in from in reflecting the increased costs for finding reserves in the gulf of mexico and some negative revisions in our oil and gas reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased by  or less than for the year ended december   compared to the prior year and depreciation  depletion and amortization per mcfe increased to from in we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective january  the statement requires that we estimate the fair value for our asset retirement obligations dismantlement and abandonment of oil and gas wells and offshore platforms in the periods the assets are first placed in service 
we then adjust the current estimated obligation for estimated inflation and market risk contingencies to the projected settlement date of the liability 
the result is then discounted to a present value from the projected settlement date to the date the asset was first placed in service 
as of january   we recorded the present value of the asset retirement obligation as an additional property cost and as an asset retirement liability 
a combination of the amortization of the additional property cost using the unit of production method and the accretion of the discounted liability is recorded as a component of our depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties 
prior to this adoption  we accrued an estimated dismantlement  restoration and abandonment liability using the unit of production method over the life of a property and included the accrued amount in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
the total accrued liability million at december  was reflected as additional accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties on our balance sheet 
in conformity with the new statement we recorded the cumulative effect of this accounting change as of january   as if we had used this method in the prior years 
at january   we increased our oil and gas properties by million  recorded million as an asset retirement obligation liability and reduced our accumulated depreciation by million million accrued dismantlement in prior years less accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of million on the increased property costs 
the adoption of the new standard had no material effect on our net income 
the following pro forma data summarizes our net income and net income per share for the years ended december   and as if we had adopted the provisions of sfas on january   including aggregate pro forma asset retirement obligations on that date years ended december  in thousands except per share amounts net income  as reported    pro forma adjustment to reflect retroactive adoption of sfas pro forma net income    net income per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma impairment of oil and gas properties because we account for our proved oil and gas properties separately  we also assess our assets for impairment property by property rather than in one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
this method of assessment is another feature of successful efforts method of accounting 
certain unforeseeable events such as significantly decreased long term oil or gas prices  failure of a well or wells to perform as projected  insufficient data on reservoir performance  and or unexpected or increased costs may cause us to record an impairment expense on a particular property 
we base our assessment of possible impairment using our best estimate of future prices  costs and expected net cash flow generated by a property 
we estimate future prices based on nymex month strips  adjusted for basis differential and escalate both the prices and the costs for inflation if appropriate 
if these estimates indicate impairment  we measure the impairment expense as the difference between the net book value of the asset and its estimated fair value measured by discounting the future net cash flow from the property at an appropriate rate 
actual prices  costs  discount rates  and net cash flow may vary from our estimates 
we recognized impairment expenses during the last three years as follows for the years ended december  in thousands unproved properties   proved properties    total impairment expense    the impairment of unproved leasehold costs includes an amortization of the aggregate individually insignificant properties adjusted by an estimated rate of future successful development over an average lease term and the specific impairment of individually significant properties 
during and the amortization of the individually insignificant properties totaled  and million  respectively 
the remaining impairments in these two years resulted from impairment of significant properties due to unsuccessful drilling results 
in  prior to our adoption of this amortization method  the impairment expense resulted from the actual due to unsuccessful exploration results or impending forfeiture of leaseholds 
the effect of the change in estimating our impairment of unproved properties was not material to our financial statements 
we analyze our proved properties for impairment indicators based on the proved reserves as determined by our independent reserve engineers 
the properties impaired in primarily consisted of two properties in the gulf of mexico which totaled million and one property in the onshore gulf coast totaling  and in included two properties in the gulf of mexico which totaled million and two in the onshore gulf coast which totaled million 
during  we impaired three proved properties in the offshore gulf of mexico that accounted for million and one proved property in south texas that accounted for million of the total million 
the impairments resulted primarily from wells depleting sooner than originally estimated or capital costs in excess of those anticipated 
general and administrative accounting for stock based compensation and defined benefit pension plan general and administrative expenses during increased by million  or compared to general and administrative expenses increased by per mcfe to in from in general and administrative expense in decreased by million due to a reduction in stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense which is included in general and administrative expense totaled million in  million in and million in in june  the board of directors approved contingent stock grants to our employees and directors 
in order for the grants to become effective  the price of our stock had to increase from per share to a trigger price of per share and close at or above per share for consecutive trading days 
further  the trigger price had to be achieved within years of the grant date 
this increase from per share to per share represented a compound annual rate of return of for years 
on the grant date we did not record any amounts for expense  liability  or equity because the measurement date for determining the compensation cost depended on the occurrence of an event after the date of grant 
therefore  we could not be sure that we would incur any expense as a result of the grants  and we could not reasonably estimate the amount of possible expense 
january   became the measurement date when the stock price closed above the trigger price for the twentieth consecutive trading day 
on that date  we measured the total compensation cost at million which was the total number of shares granted multiplied by the market price on that date 
we recorded million as restricted common stock  million as unearned compensation reported as a separate reduction in stockholders equity on the balance sheet  and million as stock based compensation expense 
the million stock based compensation expense recorded in the first quarter of included a catch up amortization from the date of the grant to the measurement date of the total compensation cost because the cost should be recognized over the time period in which the stock grant vested to the employees or directors 
we recorded million in  million in  and million in as stock based compensation expense related to the grants 
at december   million of the unearned compensation remained unamortized and will be amortized as the shares vest during the next two years 
the vesting period could accelerate in the event of a change in control of the company or the death or permanent disability of an employee 
a shorter vesting period would accelerate the amortization period 
except as noted above  the shares will be issued only to the extent the employees and directors remain with the company through the vesting dates 
in accounting for stock options granted to employees and directors  we have chosen to continue to apply the accounting method promulgated by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
rather than apply an alternative method permitted by sfas no 
under apb no 
 at the time of grant we do not record compensation expense on our income statement for stock options granted to employees or directors 
if we applied an alternative method permitted by sfas no 
 our net income would be lower than actually reported 
we disclose in our notes to consolidated financial statements the pro forma effect on our income statement if we were to record the estimated fair value of stock options on the date granted and amortize the expense over the expected vesting of the grant 
we chose the apb no 
method because we believe that the true cost of options is reflected under this method 
if and when the market price of the stock exceeds the option exercise price  the potential dilution is reflected in diluted earnings per share 
we believe this dilution is the only true cost of the option 
further  we believe that also including a theoretical or estimated dollar expense in the income statement amounts to double counting in calculating diluted income per share subtracting an amount from the numerator and adding an amount to the denominator to reflect the same non cash item 
total assets at fair market value public market prices for equity and fixed income mutual funds for our two defined benefit pension plans were million which exceeded the total accumulated benefit obligation as of december  we recorded  in pension expense and contributed  to the plans during we have consistently used an estimate for our long term rate of return on plan assets and believe that this remains appropriate based on our plans historical rates of return and on long term historical rates of return for indices similar to our current plan target asset allocation of equities and fixed income securities 
if however  we reduced the assumed rate of return by basis points  our pension plan expense would have increased by approximately  and our net income would have decreased by approximately  the discount rate is another critical assumption in determining pension liabilities and expenses 
we are required to use a rate that approximates the market rate for high quality  long term fixed income investments 
accordingly  we reduced our discount rate assumption from in to in and from in to in a lower discount rate increases the calculated present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
if the discount rate had decreased by another basis points  our pension expense would have increased by approximately  and our net income would have decreased by approximately  settlements expense and interest and financing expense during the second quarter of  we settled the phillips litigation and charged million to settlement expense 
interest and financing expense decreased during the past two years because of lower interest rates and lower outstanding debt 
income taxes during  income taxes increased by million compared to and increased by million during compared to as a result of increased income before taxes 
the effective tax rate increased slightly in due to an increase in state taxes 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets became effective for us on july   and january   respectively 
sfas no 
requires all business combinations initiated after june   to be accounted for using the purchase method 
additionally  sfas no 
requires companies to disaggregate and report separately from goodwill certain intangible assets 
sfas no 
establishes new guidelines for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized  but rather are reviewed annually for impairment 
the appropriate application of sfas nos 
and to oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves is unclear 
depending on how the accounting and disclosure literature is clarified  these oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves for both undeveloped and developed leaseholds may be classified separately from oil and gas properties  as intangible assets on our balance sheets 
additional disclosures required by sfas nos 
and would be included in the notes to financial statements 
historically  we  like many other oil and gas companies  have included these oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves as part of the oil and gas properties  even after sfas nos 
and became effective 
this interpretation of sfas nos 
and would affect only our balance sheet classification of oil and gas leaseholds 
our results of operations and cash flows would not be affected  since these oil and gas mineral rights held under lease and other contractual arrangements representing the right to extract such reserves would continue to be amortized in accordance with accounting rules for oil and gas companies provided in sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
at december   we had net leaseholds cost of approximately million 
if we applied the interpretation currently being deliberated  this classification would require us to make the disclosures set forth under sfas no 
related to these interests 
we will continue to classify our oil and gas leaseholds as oil and gas properties until further guidance is provided 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our revolving bank line of credit is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   the unpaid principal balance under the line was million which approximates its fair value 
the interest rate on this debt is based on a premium of to basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor 
the rate is reset periodically  usually every three months 
if on december   and december   libor had changed by one full percentage point basis points the fair value of our revolving debt would have changed by approximately  and  respectively 
we have not entered into any interest rate hedging contracts 
commodity price risk a vast majority of our production is sold on the spot markets 
accordingly  we are at risk for the volatility in the commodity prices inherent in the oil and gas industry 
occasionally we sell forward portions of our production under physical delivery contracts that by their terms cannot be settled in cash or other financial instruments 
such contracts are not subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly we do not provide sensitivity analysis for such contracts 
we currently have no such arrangements in place
