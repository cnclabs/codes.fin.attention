item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future 
forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward looking statements as a result of many known or unknown factors  including  but not limited to  those factors discussed below in this item under the sub heading risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with item selected financial data and item financial statements and supplementary data appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a world leader in travel commerce  marketing and distributing travel products and services and providing technology solutions to the travel industry 
during  we generated revenues by providing travel marketing and distribution services to travel agencies  corporate travel departments and travel suppliers through our sabre travel network business segment  to consumers through our travelocity business segment  and to businesses through our former getthere business segment 
we also generated revenues in by selling products and services through our sabre airline solutions business segment 
during the fourth quarter of we integrated the products  services and operations of our getthere business unit into our other three business units 
this resulted in moving getthere s corporate trip business to sabre travel network  getthere s supplier website to sabre airline solutions  and getthere s technology and development infrastructure to travelocity 
accordingly  we no longer report getthere as a separate segment 
in  approximately of our revenue was generated from sabre travel network  from travelocity and from sabre airline solutions based on segment results that include intersegment revenues 
business 
we are an industry leader in multiple travel distribution channels the travel agency channel  the consumer direct channel and the business direct channel 
we are a leading distributor of travel in each of those channels through the following business segments sabre travel network our sabre travel network segment markets and distributes travel related products and services through the travel agency channel 
travel agencies  both online and brick and mortar  subscribe to our services 
our services provide travel agency subscribers information about and the ability to purchase travel related products and services from airlines  hotels  car rental companies  cruise lines and others 
we also provide travel agency office automation tools and enable travel agencies to provide services via the internet 
travelocity our travelocity segment markets and distributes travel related products and services directly to individuals  including leisure travelers and business travelers  through websites that travelocity owns  and websites owned by its distribution partners and its call centers 
travelocity customers can access offerings  pricing and information about airlines  hotels  car rental companies  cruise lines  vacation and last minute travel packages and other travel related services 
in  travelocity launched travelocity business  which combines the integrated online corporate travel technology and full service offering products of getthere with the expertise of travelocity 
sabre airline solutions our sabre airline solutions segment is a global leader in providing airline software systems and airline and airport consulting services 
sabre airline solutions comprehensive software portfolio provides integrated technology and services to airlines 
sabre airline solutions hosts airline reservation systems for more than airlines 
it also offers systems ranging from inventory and departure control to decision support software that enable airlines to improve operational efficiency and maximize revenues 
sabre airline solutions also provides consulting services to optimize airline and airport operations 
we believe that in  air travel in the united states was adversely affected by a decline in travel resulting from several factors including unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  political and economic instability abroad  ongoing travel security concerns  fear of potential terrorist attack  and travelers fear of exposure to contagious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
as further discussed in the reduced volume of travel bookings section of business trends below  we have experienced significant decreases in bookings volumes due to reduced travel in the united states and  to a lesser degree  internationally due to these trends 
for the three years ended december   operating expenses from continuing operations have increased at a compound annual rate of 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions of getthere  preview  gradient solutions limited now sabre travel international limited  sabre pacific  dillon communications  site and the purchase of the remaining publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com was million in  million in and million in amortization of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets ceased on january  upon our adoption of sfas note to the consolidated financial statements  resulting in approximately million less amortization expense during than in absent the effect of the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  operating expenses from continuing operations have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 
our primary operating expenses consist of salaries  benefits  other employee related costs  communication costs  advertising and customer incentives  representing approximately  and of total operating expenses in  and  respectively 
those expenses increased at a compound annual rate of for the three years ended december   primarily due to higher customer incentives expenses 
business trends reduced volume of travel bookings 
since  we have experienced declines in year over year bookings volume in our sabre travel network business segment 
the factors producing this trend have also affected the growth in the volume of bookings for our travelocity business segment 
we attribute the declines to several factors that have occurred during this period  including unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  political and economic instability abroad  ongoing travel security concerns due to the war in iraq and the aftermath of the september  terrorist attacks  fear of potential terrorist attack  travelers fear of exposure to contagious diseases such as sars  and channel shift discussed below under supplier efforts to control travel distribution 
total bookings during the fourth quarter of  including air and non air bookings  were down in the united states and were up globally as compared to the year ago quarter 
for the year ended december  our total bookings were down in the united states and globally as compared to the year ago period 
total air bookings during the fourth quarter of were down in the united states  but were up globally as compared to the year ago quarter 
during the year ended december  our total air bookings were down in the united states and globally as compared to the year ago period 
supplier efforts to control travel distribution 
airlines have aggressively worked to move travel bookings onto channels that they control 
some airlines have withheld content from independent travel distributors  have greatly reduced commissions paid to online and traditional travel agencies and have conditioned independent distributors access to content on their acceptance of distribution cost savings offered by channels that those airlines control 
their collective efforts have contributed to channel shift  or travel bookings being moved from independent gds channels toward supplier controlled channels  individual supplier websites and call centers 
similarly  several hotels now have similar multi vendor websites for booking hotels and other accommodations 
additionally  as discussed below under risk factors regulatory developments  current proposed government regulations in europe  if adopted as proposed  could also contribute to the shift of bookings from independent computer reservation systems crs to supplier controlled crss 
in the last two quarters of  we saw a slight slowing in the rate of channel shift  possibly due to the dca year pricing option program discussed below 
although we see this slight trend as an encouraging indicator  we do not know if this represents a permanent slowing in the shift of gds bookings to supplier direct booking channels 
dca year pricing option 
in october  we announced a new direct connect availability dca year pricing option to airlines 
airlines selecting this option under their sabre gds participating carrier agreements receive a discount of approximately from the applicable dca booking fee rates  and are locked into that booking fee rate for three years 
as a consequence  we will not be able to raise the booking fee rate on those dca bookings during that three year period 
we anticipate that by the end of  approximately of our global direct bookings will fall under the dca year option 
as of the date of this report  more than airlines  including american  delta airlines  inc  northwest airlines corporation  continental airlines  inc  united air lines  inc  us airways  inc  british airways and alitalia have elected to participate in the dca year pricing option 
as of february   we are no longer marketing the dca year pricing option to carriers 
through the sabre dca year pricing option  participating airlines commit to the highest level of participation in the sabre system dca level for three years 
participating airlines provide all sabre gds users with broad access to schedules  seat availability and published fares  including web fares and other promotional fares but excluding certain fares such as opaque fares where the airline s identity is not disclosed until after the sale and private discounts 
participating airlines also furnish generally the same customer perquisites and amenities to passengers booked through the sabre gds as those afforded through other gds s and websites 
as a consequence  we believe that the participation of carriers in the program may help slow the present shift of bookings away from the sabre gds to supplier controlled outlets 
see risk factors travel suppliers are seeking to bypass consolidation 
the marketplace for travel products is intensely competitive  and consolidation is occurring among both online and brick and mortar travel agencies 
consolidation among our competitors  such as the acquisitions of expedia  hotels 
com and hotwire consummated by interactivecorp  may give these competitors increased negotiating leverage with travel suppliers 
new or consolidated competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
the development of competing technologies or the emergence of new industry standards may also adversely affect our competitive position 
competition could result in reduced margins on our offerings and services 
see risk factors we face competition merchant model 
independent travel distributors  including our companies  are attempting to reduce their reliance on supplier paid commissions and booking or transaction fees by increasingly promoting a merchant model of travel distribution whereby the travel distributors obtain access to content from travel suppliers at a pre determined price and sell the content  either individually or in a package  to travelers at a price which the distributor determines 
merchant model content can include air  hotel  vacation  and dynamically packaged offerings via travelocity totaltrip 
merchant content is good for travelers because they can often purchase travel at a lower price than regularly published offerings 
for us  merchant content generally delivers higher revenue per transaction than comparable sales under the agency booking fee model 
under our arrangements with travel suppliers  we generally do not have any purchase obligations for unsold offerings 
under the merchant model  we recognize as revenue the amount paid by the traveler minus our payment to the travel supplier 
our business strategy depends on our merchant model offering as a significant source of revenue 
we remain subject to numerous risks in the operation and growth of that business 
our merchant model hotel strategy is particularly dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate access to hotel rooms to offer  through travelocity or through our sabre exclusives program  which require pre payment by the consumer at the time of booking 
our strategy calls for us to increase or maintain the number of hotel rooms we can offer under our merchant model hotel program based upon merchant arrangements we make directly with individual hotel properties and hotel chains 
if improved economic conditions create increased demand for hotel rooms  hotel managers may limit the amount of hotel rooms available to us or increase the negotiated rates at which they provide rooms to us 
similarly  heightened competition from our competitors own merchant rate programs may result in less available rooms or increases in negotiated rates for our merchant offerings 
these types of events could exert downward pressure on the margins we expect to achieve in our merchant model offering 
termination of affiliation agreement with hotels 
com 
on august   travelocity exercised its right  pursuant to its affiliation agreement with hotels 
com  to expand the distribution of our own merchant hotel offerings 
as a result  we subsequently agreed with hotels 
com to terminate the affiliation agreement and settled all amounts outstanding between the parties 
due to the termination  we wrote off an intangible asset associated with this contract of approximately million 
additionally  we recognized revenue of approximately million related to warrants received from hotels 
com pursuant to this agreement  which had previously been deferred and was being recognized over the term of the agreement 
we believe that this contract termination will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  and that the termination provides us increased flexibility to control the content and pricing of our merchant model hotel offering 
aol agreement 
in  we entered into an agreement with america online aol that provided  among other things  that travelocity would be the exclusive reservations engine for aol s internet properties 
we were initially obligated for payments of up to million and we shared advertising revenues and commissions with aol 
in january  we revised the terms of this agreement and extended the agreement through march travelocity will continue to be the exclusive reservations engine for aol s internet properties under the revised agreement 
under the new terms of the agreement  we will benefit from more strategically aligned terms for placement within aol s brands 
further  we are obligated for fixed payments of up to million over the two year term of the agreement 
these fixed payments  along with fixed payments previously paid under the original contract  are being expensed on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
for  this expense will be approximately million 
additionally  in exchange for lower fixed annual payments  we agreed to a reduced share of advertising revenues generated through the aol properties 
the agreement also contains a productivity component  whereby aol is paid a percentage of the transactions services revenue generated through the aol network 
while specific operating earnings benefits from this agreement will depend upon the volume of transactions  we anticipate approximately million to million in such benefits during wns agreement 
on january   we entered into a multi year master services agreement with wns north america  inc wns 
under the agreement  we will outsource to wns a portion of our travelocity contact center operations  primarily front line customer service calls and back office fulfillment 
by the end of the first quarter of  wns should be handling travelocity s front line customer service calls and emails  as well as some mid and back office functions 
wns will transition these day to day operations of the customer service functions to its contact centers 
travelocity employees will continue to handle sales calls  as well as advanced customer service issues and quality control 
we do not expect any severance and related costs incurred due to this agreement to be significant 
while specific savings from this agreement will depend upon the volume of transactions  we anticipate approximately million in such savings during we also expect these savings to increase over the term of the agreement as transaction volumes increase 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cost reductions 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we have implemented plans to reduce costs in an effort to enhance our competitive advantage  reduce our operating expense and better align expenses with revenue targets 
as part of these cost management efforts  we reduced our workforce in the fourth quarter of  and the full year impact of these reductions on our financial results will be realized in the aol and wns agreements described above are also components of this initiative 
through all of these initiatives we expect to generate savings of approximately million in we will continue to examine numerous cost reduction alternatives  including global sourcing  as we seek to reduce costs to enhance our competitive advantages 
changing business model 
although the substantial majority of our travel distribution revenues are derived from booking fees paid by travel suppliers  we recently have entered into agreements that do not follow this traditional business model  and are currently evaluating the desirability of similar transactions 
under such agreements  we may generally derive revenues from transaction fees based on the number of segments booked  but the structure and source of those transaction fees may be modified to take advantage of specific market conditions 
in addition  in october of  we launched our jurni network consortium  a unique offline travel agency consortium that combines a preferred sales network and consolidated purchasing power with technology driven marketing tools to sell preferred offerings 
computer reservation system industry regulation 
aspects of our travel marketing and distribution businesses are subject to the computer reservation systems crs regulations in the united states  the european union  canada and peru 
these regulations generally address the relationships among the crss  the airline suppliers and subscribers such as travel agencies 
generally  these regulations do not address our relationships with non airline suppliers 
the regulations in the european union  however  do include rail suppliers in certain circumstances 
among the topics addressed in the current regulations are no preferencing crs displays based upon airline identity  equal treatment of airlines by the crss  equal participation by airlines that own a crs in other systems and limits on travel agency contract terms 
as part of its comprehensive review of its crs rules  the us department of transportation dot announced  on december   that it would not adopt the new rules that it proposed in november instead  the dot will allow the existing crs rules to expire entirely 
nearly all of the existing crs rules expired on january  two requirements will remain in effect through july   at which time they too will expire 
therefore  the crs industry in the united states will be completely deregulated by the dot after july  the two transitional requirements effective until july   are a ban on preferenced displays  which prohibits a crs from listing airline flight segments based on the identity of the airline  and a ban on the enforcement of two types of contractual parity clauses which  as a condition for an airline s participation in a crs  require either that the airline maintain a certain level of participation in that crs or buy enhancements based on the level and nature of its participation in other crss  or provide the crs with all of the airline s published fares 
we believe that dot deregulation will give us a much greater ability to find creative ways to market and promote airline services  thus enhancing our value proposition for airlines and supporting our transition to the merchant model 
the dot indicated that our current dca year pricing option agreements  which represent three year participation commitments from more than airlines  including the largest united states airlines  are not affected by deregulation or the transition requirements 
we expect that deregulation will affect our relationships with airlines in many ways  including the previous rules broadly imposed a one size fits all model on our relationships with airlines 
under deregulation  sabre travel network will have the flexibility to tailor specific proposals to individual airlines 
beginning august   we will have increased flexibility to construct our displays of airline services in new ways a right we have always had for displays of hotel services 
dot deregulation will also allow us to freely negotiate with travel agencies  which will permit us to choose to have contracts of any duration  to have exclusive agreements with travel agents  and or to vary incentives by the identity of the airline 
in addition  both the european commission and canada are in the process of reviewing their regulations governing the crs industry for possible changes  including eliminating some or all of these regulations 
the european commission has not yet published any proposed rules changes  so it is not clear when the commission may issue amended final rules or what form they may take 
transport canada has proposed amendments to its crs rules that would eliminate many of the current rules  but would retain  unchanged or with modifications  certain existing rules which could continue to limit our business flexibility  such as retaining a ban on display preferences for airlines 
transport canada has not yet published its final rules  so it is not clear when the department may issue amended final rules or what form they may take 
the potential effects of these trends  events and uncertainties are discussed below under risk factors 
components of revenues and expenses revenues 
sabre travel network primarily generates revenues from booking fees charged to airlines and non air travel suppliers who process their bookings through the sabre system 
sabre travel network also earns revenue through equipment service charges paid by subscribers  the sale of other products and services including getthere offerings  merchant hotel sales in the sabre exclusives program and the jurni network to travel suppliers  subscribers and other customers  as well as earnings derived from interests in joint ventures and other investments

financial results the following table presents operating results for the three years ended december   and in thousands of dollars 
the segment revenues and cost of revenues are shown including intersegment activity 
we have included the elimination of intersegment activity below to agree to the results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements year ended december  segment revenues sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    elimination of intersegment revenues   total    cost of revenues sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    elimination of intersegment expenses   other corporate expenses    total    selling  general and administrative amortization of acquisition intangibles sabre travel network    travelocity    sabre airline solutions    total    operating income loss results of operations total revenues of  million for the year ended december  were million  or  lower than revenues of  million for the year ended december  cost of revenues of  million for the year ended december  were lower than the cost of revenues of  million for the year ended december  these reported revenues and expenses are net of intersegment revenues and expenses which were eliminated in consolidation 
management s following discussion and analysis of revenues and cost of revenues by business segment are based upon the information contained in the above table  where segment results include intersegment revenues and cost of revenues of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we account for significant intersegment transactions as if the transactions were to third parties  that is  at estimated current market prices 
the majority of the intersegment revenues and cost of revenues are between travelocity and sabre travel network  consisting mainly of incentives and marketing fees for travelocity bookings made through the sabre gds  data processing fees paid by travelocity to sabre travel network  and fees paid by sabre travel network and sabre airline solutions for corporate and airline trips booked through travelocity s online booking technology 
all intersegment revenues and corresponding cost of revenues have been eliminated in consolidation 
disaggregated results by segment are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues 
the compounded annual growth rate of revenues by segment for through was for sabre travel network  for travelocity and for sabre airline solutions 
each of our business segments was negatively affected by the september  terrorist attacks  and a decline in the us economy  in general  and the travel industry  in particular  since that time 
other macroeconomic factors that negatively impacted our business during this period included the war and continued conflict in iraq  ongoing travel security concerns and fear of potential terrorist attacks and sars 
these negative impacts to the general economy and the travel industry specifically negatively impacted each of our business segments  with the most pronounced effect being on sabre travel network  where revenues remained below revenue levels 
we have also seen continued pressure on sabre travel network revenues resulting from travel bookings being diverted from independent gds channels toward supplier controlled channels  individual airline websites and call centers  as well as various other travel distribution websites on the internet 
the combination of channel shift  an economic downturn  and travel security concerns has resulted in a cumulative decrease in annual bookings processed through the sabre system since we believe that the signing of the dca year pricing option agreements will help slow the effects of channel shift from the sabre system  but the dca year pricing option agreements will lower our effective yield on bookings 
travelocity has experienced compounded annual growth in revenues from to due to the growth in bookings made through our websites and increased yields stimulated by increased merchant hotel activity and improved packaging of offerings 
although travelocity was negatively affected by the terrorist attacks and the negative factors noted above and by declining internet advertising revenue  the growth in the internet travel business combined with travelocity merchant model and packaging initiatives offset the negative impacts 
sabre airline solutions revenues increased per year from to although sabre airline solutions and its customers were negatively affected by the terrorist attacks and the negative factors noted above  we were able to grow revenues in each of the past two years 
this increase in revenues during a turbulent time for the airline industry is the result of increased sales of decision support products and services and web enabled solutions that offer cost savings and more efficient operations to our customers 
expenses 
from to  our operating expenses decreased by approximately 
these decreases reflect lower intangible asset amortization charges in each business unit due to the adoption of sfas effective january  and lower data processing costs in each business unit achieved through the eds contract 
in addition  sabre travel network hardware and communications costs have decreased as a result of the migration to lower cost solutions and the adoption of third party solutions by subscribers 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in sabre travel network technology spending due to the phased implementation of new functionality that requires running legacy systems as well as the new technology  and increases in sabre travel network customer incentives due to competitive pressures on renewals and conversions 
we experienced growth in travelocity cost of revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses commensurate with the growth in business 
we increased our expenditures for advertising in order to drive additional travelers to travelocity  and expenses have increased as a result of increases in transaction volumes for our merchant offerings 
our technology infrastructure related expenses have also increased in order to support our growth and new offerings 
these increases in expenses were offset by reduced intangible asset amortization expenses resulting from our adoption of sfas effective january  sabre airline solutions operating expenses grew commensurate with the growth in revenues during the to period 
compared to total revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to approximately  million 
management s discussion and analysis of revenues and cost of revenues by business segment are based upon segment results including intersegment revenues and cost of revenues of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we account for significant intersegment transactions as if the transactions were to third parties  that is  at estimated current market prices 
the majority of the intersegment revenues and cost of revenues are between travelocity and sabre travel network  consisting mainly of incentives and marketing fees for travelocity bookings made through the sabre gds  data processing fees paid by travelocity to sabre travel network  and fees paid by sabre travel network for corporate and airline trips booked through travelocity s online booking technology 
all intersegment revenues and corresponding cost of revenues have been eliminated in consolidation 
disaggregated results by segment are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues 
total revenues including intersegment revenues for the year ended december  were flat compared to the year ended december   increasing approximately million from  million to  million 
we believe that revenues in each of our segments were adversely affected by a decline in travel resulting from several factors that occurred during this period  including unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  political and economic instability abroad such as the war in iraq and its aftermath  ongoing travel security concerns due to the continued conflict in iraq  fear of potential terrorist attacks  and travelers fear of exposure to contagious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
sabre travel network revenues decreased million or  from  million in to  million in booking and other fees from associates decreased by million due to economic conditions in the united states  the ongoing travel security concerns discussed above and channel shift 
this million decrease includes a million reduction due to lower volumes  partially offset by a million increase attributable to an increase in average rate per booking  which includes the impact of dca year pricing option 
total worldwide travel bookings processed through the sabre system  which include direct connect bookings and joint venture bookings for which we or our distribution partners earn a booking fee  were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million bookings in booking volumes have not recovered to the levels we experienced prior to additionally  bookings made under the dca year pricing option agreements were at a discount of approximately from rates 
the effect on revenues from the decreases in booking volumes were partially offset by a increase in the average price per booking charged to air associates during  notwithstanding the impact of dca year pricing option 
subscriber revenue increased by million  driven by settlement revenue from a canceled subscriber contract 
excluding the settlement  subscriber revenue would have decreased by million driven by a declining base of equipment leased to subscribers 
other revenue decreased by million  driven primarily by decreased equity income and development revenue from our joint ventures 
travelocity revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
transaction revenue increased million or  primarily driven by a million increase in non air transaction revenue including revenue resulting from sales of merchant model and package offerings and a million increase in stand alone air transaction revenue 
transaction revenue from our distribution partners websites increased approximately compared to a increase in transaction revenue from the travelocity 
com websites 
the increase in non air transaction revenue consisted primarily of the following stand alone hotel revenue growth of million due to bookings volume growth of  and the growth of our own merchant model hotel offering launched in october total merchant hotel room nights increased by 
approximately of our total hotel room nights sold in were under our merchant model  packaged trip revenue increased approximately million due to growth in last minute packages site products  and the launch of our totaltrip offering in june  cruise revenue increased million due primarily to successful promotions like our cruise super sale during the peak cruise seasons  and the remaining million increase in non air transaction revenue was driven by car revenues 
the increase in stand alone air transaction revenue was primarily due to a service fee implemented on january  for most stand alone air tickets  partially offset by the growth in air tickets sold as part of packaged sales which increased significantly and is included in non air transaction revenues 
non transaction revenue decreased million  or consisting of the following we recognized revenue of approximately million due to the termination of our affiliation with hotels 
com 
this revenue was related to the warrants received from hotels 
com pursuant to this affiliation that had previously been deferred and was being recognized over the term of the affiliation agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these warrants 
advertising revenues decreased million primarily due to a decrease in advertising revenue from aol 
the recognition of net losses from our equity investments in joint ventures resulted in a million decrease 
these net losses from joint ventures relate to our investments in joint ventures for the establishment of online travel reservation sites in the far east and europe 
these joint ventures began operations during and losses in were in line with expectations as we continue investment in these markets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the accounting policies for our joint ventures 
all other non transaction revenues decreased by approximately million driven by reduced fees to handle paper tickets resulting from increased usage of electronic tickets  partially offset by an increase in fees for ticket reissues and offline services 
sabre airline solutions revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
this increase was driven primarily by the following million increase in revenues from decision support products and services provided to various travel providers 
key components of this increase included revenues from a large resource management contract and growth in the emergo offering  which is a web enabled application service provider asp product line  million increase in airline reservation hosting revenue due to an increase in the number of signed carriers as well as transaction fees linked to an increase in passenger volumes on existing airline customers  million increase in revenues from airline consulting services due to additional service offerings that we acquired during the fourth quarter of  and million decrease in development revenues from major customers as those airlines slowed purchases to reduce costs during the industry downturn 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues including intersegment cost of revenues for the year ended december  increased approximately million or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
sabre travel network cost of revenues increased million or  from million to  million 
this increase was due to a million increase in technology spending  a million increase in subscriber support costs and an increase in other expense of million 
the million increase in technology spending includes million in technology costs including depreciation and various technology maintenance and investments activities  million related to the phased implementation of new functionality which required us to operate legacy systems as well as the new systems  million related to a partial restructuring of our information technology outsourcing agreement with eds and million due to the expiration of other vendor credits 
the phased implementation of our new functionality is expected to be completed in the million increase in subscriber support costs includes a million increase in customer incentives  partially offset by million of reductions in hardware support and communications costs 
the increase in customer incentives includes million related to increases in the average incentive per booking driven by competitive pressure on renewals and conversions  million related to lower incentive levels in associated with the aftermath of september   and the loss of customers that reimbursed us for one time data processing charges in and million related to incentive payments to travelocity 
the million reduction in hardware support and communications costs are driven by migration to lower cost solutions and the adoption of third party solutions by subscribers 
travelocity cost of revenues increased million or  from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in credit card fee expense primarily associated with strong growth of our merchant model business 
data processing and technology infrastructure related expenses also increased million driven by volume growth 
all other expenses decreased by million 
sabre airline solutions cost of revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
this increase was the result of higher labor costs of million due to increased salaries and higher employee benefit costs  increased depreciation and amortization of million as a result of continued investment in the emergo solutions infrastructure and the reservations hosting system  increased communications and data processing costs of million due to an increase in hosted customers and passenger volumes  and a million increase in other operating expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in development labor of million resulting from a decline in demand for development labor because of reduced spending by airlines 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased million or  compared to the year ended december  from million to million 
the increase is primarily due to higher travelocity advertising costs of million to drive additional travelers to our websites and a million increase in travelocity payments to distribution partners 
corporate facilities costs increased approximately million as a result of the facilities consolidation in these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in travelocity salaries and benefits primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation expense 
during travelocity incurred legal expenses for our tender offer for the common stock of travelocity which we did not own  so that legal expenses were million lower as compared to sabre travel network marketing expenses decreased by million resulting from the renegotiation of a marketing agreement 
other selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million write off of an intangible asset resulting from the termination of the hotels 
com agreement  partially offset by decreases totaling million due to the full amortization of other intangible assets 
operating income 
operating income for the year ended december  decreased million  as compared to the year ended december  from million to million 
operating margins decreased from in to in due to an increase in operating expenses while revenues remained unchanged 
sabre travel network s operating income decreased million or  due primarily to decreased bookings revenues and increases in technology spending and customer incentives during as compared to travelocity s operating loss decreased million or  due primarily to an increase in transaction revenue which outpaced higher advertising and customer incentives 
sabre airline solutions operating income increased by million due to increases in product and services revenues which outpaced the increase in operating expenses 
interest income 
interest income decreased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to lower average rates of return on our portfolio of cash and marketable securities investment accounts  as well as slightly lower average balances held in these investments 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million or  from million to million 
this increase was primarily due to an approximately million increase in interest expense resulting from the capital lease on our headquarters buildings  partially offset by a million decrease resulting from lower interest rates on our libor based interest rate swaps 
other  net 
other  net decreased million or  from other income of million to other expense of million  from to other  net during was primarily due to an million gain from the sale of our former corporate headquarters building  a million gain realized from the sale of france telecom formerly equant nv shares and other investment gains of million  partially offset by million in writedowns of investments in companies developing emerging travel technologies 
during we incurred a million loss relating to the required residual value guarantee payment in connection with terminating our syndicated lease facility 
we also realized a million loss on the sale of a building during minority interests 
minority interests include minority owners interests in our consolidated subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in april  we acquired the approximately million publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com that we did not previously own 
accordingly  minority interests during only reflect these interests in travelocity 
com for the period prior to acquisition 
during the year ended december  the net income allocated to minority interests was less than million compared to less than million of net loss allocated to remaining minority interests during the year ended december  income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for was approximately  which varies from the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due to foreign tax credits that we claimed related to joint venture activities accounted for under the equity method and for which the offsetting foreign tax expense was recorded in pre tax income 
this reduction in the tax rate was partially offset by additional state income taxes 
our effective tax rate for of varied from the statutory us federal income tax rate of primarily due to state income taxes

net earnings 
net earnings decreased million or  from million to million  primarily due to increases in cost of revenues of million  increases in selling  general and administrative expenses million  a decrease in other  net income of million and a decrease in interest income of million 
these decreases in net earnings were partially offset by lower income taxes of million 
results of operations compared to total revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
cost of revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to approximately  million 
management s discussion and analysis of revenues and cost of revenues by business segment are based upon segment results including intersegment revenues and cost of revenues of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of the intersegment revenues and cost of revenues are between travelocity and sabre travel network  consisting mainly of incentives and marketing fees for travelocity bookings made through the sabre gds and data processing fees paid by travelocity to sabre travel network  and trip fees paid by sabre travel network and sabre airline solutions for trips booked through travelocity s online booking technology 
all intersegment revenues and corresponding cost of revenues have been eliminated in consolidation 
disaggregated results by segment are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues 
total revenues including intersegment revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million  or  compared to year ended december   from  million to  million 
sabre travel network revenues decreased million or  from  million in to  million in booking and other fees from associates decreased by million 
total worldwide travel bookings processed through the sabre system  which include direct connect bookings and joint venture bookings for which we or our distribution partners earn a booking fee  were million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million bookings in the effect on revenues from the decreases in booking volumes were partially offset by a increase in average price per booking charged to associates during subscriber revenue decreased by million driven by a declining base of equipment leased to subscribers 
other revenue increased by million  driven by higher volumes through the getthere booking tool 
travelocity revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
transaction revenue increased million  primarily driven by a million increase in non air transaction revenue  partially offset by a million decrease in stand alone air transaction revenue 
the increase in non air transaction revenue consisted of stand alone hotel revenue increased million due to an increase in merchant volumes  cruise  vacation  and last minute packages revenues increased million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the march acquisition of sitecom  inc which significantly contributed to the growth of last minute packages  car revenue decreased million due to lower volumes 
much like our sabre travel network segment  we believe that the decreases in stand alone air and car revenues can primarily be attributed to economic conditions in the united states and travel security concerns 
additionally  average revenues per transaction were lower due to changes made by carriers in our air commission structure 
non transaction revenue increased million  or  consisting of the following advertising revenue decreased million due primarily to the general softening of the online advertising market 
corporate revenues from sabre travel network increased million due to higher volumes by sabre travel network for the use of our corporate booking tool 
the recognition of losses from our equity investments in joint ventures resulted in a million revenue decrease 
these losses from joint ventures relate to our investments in joint ventures for the establishment of online travel reservation sites in the far east and europe 
these joint ventures began operations during and the losses were anticipated 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the accounting policies for our joint ventures 
other revenues increased million primarily due to the recognition of additional revenue related to warrants received from hotels 
com note to the consolidated financial statements and revenue earned from services provided to our joint ventures 
sabre airline solutions revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million  as a result of million increase in revenues from applications development products and services provided to various travel providers 
the increase in products and services was due to acquisitions and various product sales in  and million decrease in passenger solutions revenue 
this decrease resulted from a decline in revenue from services provided to air travel providers  such as united airlines  for hosting their consumer websites 
the decline reflects the decrease in travel as well as the loss of several customers 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in airline reservation hosting revenue generated by the signings of new carriers coupled with an increase in access fees 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues including intersegment cost of revenues for the year ended december  decreased approximately million or  compared to the year ended december   from  million to  million 
sabre travel network cost of revenues decreased million or  from  million to million 
this decrease was primarily due to lower communications and data processing costs of million resulting from lower transaction volumes and savings resulting from our it infrastructure outsourcing services contract with eds  which was effective july  the outsourcing agreement also resulted in lower depreciation and amortization of million due to the sale of subscriber equipment to eds in this transaction 
customer incentives decreased million due to lower booking volumes attributable to the decline in travel after the terrorist attacks in september employee related costs decreased million due to december workforce reductions and lower incentive compensation expenses and all other operating expenses decreased million 
travelocity cost of revenues increased million or  from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of approximately million higher data processing and technology infrastructure related expenses  million in additional call center expenses  million in additional facility expenses due to higher sales volumes and to support our growth  and million increase in all other expenses 
sabre airline solutions cost of revenues increased approximately million or  from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of increased labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased million or  compared to the year ended december  from million to million 
the decrease is partially due to lower salaries and benefits of million resulting from reduced headcount in bad debt expense decreased million in compared to after nearly doubling our allowance for bad debts in to million  we reduced this allowance by million  or  to million at december  this reduction was due  in part  to a large payment from a customer in a bankruptcy dispute which resulted in an approximate million reduction in the allowance 
these expense decreases were partially offset by a net million increase in all other expenses 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill and intangible assets decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  goodwill and intangible assets of approximately billion were recorded in connection with the merger of travelocity 
com and preview travel  the acquisitions of getthere  gradient solutions limited now sabre travel international limited and a interest in dillon communications systems during  as well as the acquisition of sabre pacific in march acquired goodwill and intangible assets were being amortized over periods ranging from one to seven years 
amortization of this goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets ceased on january  upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
our adoption of sfas resulted in approximately million less of gross amortization expense related to these acquisitions during compared with this reduction was offset by an increase in amortization expense of million for intangible assets still subject to amortization due to the acquisition of sitecom  inc  the acquisition of the travelocity 
com minority interest and the impact of having a full year of amortization for intangible assets related to the acquisition of sabre pacific 
see the discussion in note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the effect of adopting sfas on accounting for acquired goodwill and certain intangible assets 
operating income 
operating income for the year ended december  increased million  as compared to the year ended december  from a million operating loss to a million operating income 
operating margins increased from in to during due to a decrease in operating expenses while revenues only declined 
this expense decrease was primarily due to reduced goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible asset amortization resulting from our adoption of sfas effective january  sabre travel network s operating income increased million or  due primarily to decreases in communications  data processing  depreciation and amortization  customer incentives  and salaries and benefits during as compared to that more than offset the decline in revenue 
travelocity s operating loss decreased million or  due primarily to lower goodwill amortization charges 
sabre airline solutions operating income decreased by million due to increases in operating expenses while revenues remained constant 
further  although we cannot precisely quantify the effect  we believe that and operating incomes in all operating segments were negatively impacted by the events of september   and the decline in the travel industry and the general economy both domestically and internationally 
interest income 
interest income increased by million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   due primarily to higher average balances maintained in our cash and marketable securities accounts  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million or  from million to million 
this decrease was primarily due to the retirement of million of debt in july and august  partially offset by interest on the million in aggregate principal amount of notes we issued august other  net 
other  net decreased million or  from million to million  from to other  net during was due primarily to a million gain from the sale of france telecom formerly equant nv shares  partially offset by writedowns of investments we had made in companies developing emerging travel technologies totaling million 
the million in other  net during was primarily due to an million gain from the sale of our former corporate headquarters building  a million gain realized from the sale of france telecom shares and other investment gains of million  partially offset by million in writedowns of investments in companies developing emerging travel technologies 
minority interests 
minority interests include minority owners interests in our consolidated subsidiaries 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in april we acquired the approximately million publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com that we did not previously own 
accordingly  minority interests during only reflect these interests in travelocity 
com for the period prior to acquisition 
during  the full year net loss of travelocity 
com resulted in minority interests of approximately million 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for was approximately which varies from the statutory us federal income tax rate of due primarily to state income taxes 
our effective tax rate for was primarily as a result of the effect of the recognition of non deductible amortization expense for goodwill recorded in conjunction with the acquisitions of getthere and preview travel in excluding the effects of the goodwill amortization  our effective tax rate for was 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million from a loss of million during to income of million in this increase is primarily due to the million increase in operating income  partially offset by a million decrease in minority interests and a million increase in income taxes 
income from discontinued operations 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our information technology infrastructure outsourcing business to eds effective july  which resulted in net income from discontinued operations of million 
there were no discontinued operations during cumulative effect of accounting change 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  effective january  we recognized a non recurring cumulative gain in earnings for the year ended upon adoption of sfas of approximately million  net of minority interests of approximately million and deferred income taxes of approximately million  relating to the hotels 
com warrants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net earnings 
net earnings increased million or  from million to million  primarily due to decreases in operating expenses of  which exceeded the decrease in revenues between years 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  invest in our products and offerings  pay dividends  and service our debt and other long term liabilities 
while our primary source of funds has been from our operations  we have occasionally raised external funds through the sale of stock and debt in the capital market and in privately negotiated transactions 
in assessing our liquidity  key components include our net income adjusted for non cash and non operating items  and current assets and liabilities  in particular accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued expenses 
for the longer term  our debt and long term liabilities are also considered key to assessing our liquidity 
our future minimum non cancelable contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands of dollars payments due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter notes payable      capital lease obligations     operating lease obligations     it outsourcing agreement     aol agreement note    yahoo agreement note    other long term obligations     amounts receivable under non cancelable subleases   total contractual cash obligations    includes all interest and principal related to million unsecured note

consists primarily of minimum payments due under various marketing agreements 
also  includes liabilities owed to a joint venture partner and related interest 
eds subleases an office facility from us in fort worth  texas  that will expire in in the near term  we anticipate that cash flows from our operations  existing balances in cash and short term investments of million and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  capital expenditures  investments in our products and offerings and interest payments on our debt 
we plan to renew the credit facility before it expires on september  we believe that capital expenditures in will be approximately million to million  approximately million higher than the million that was expended in  due to strategic investments in technology 
however  we expect future capital expenditures to remain significantly lower than the million expended in additionally  we sponsor the sabre inc legacy pension plan lpp  which is a tax qualified defined benefit pension plan for employees meeting certain eligibility requirements 
we also sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for certain of our employees in canada 
we are currently not required to make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in on january  we entered into a multi year master services agreement with wns north america  inc wns 
under the agreement  we will outsource to wns a portion of our travelocity contact center operations  primarily front line customer service calls and back office fulfillment 
for  we have minimum commitments to wns of million 
thereafter  we are committed to minimum payments based on a calculation that considers both current and historical volumes compared to thresholds established in the agreement 
for through  the starting thresholds for calculating our minimum commitment for each year ranges from approximately million to million  and actual commitments could be lower than these amounts  depending on volumes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the long term  we expect to use our existing funds and cash flows from operations to satisfy our debt and other long term liability obligations 
we may also consider using our funds available or possibly external sources of funds for acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies when such opportunities become available 
such additional activities might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities 
during  we began using our available funds to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders and to repurchase our shares of stock  as approved by our board of directors 
we have million left of a million stock repurchase authorization from our board of directors 
we also have separate authority from our board of directors to repurchase shares as needed to settle our share delivery obligations under the employee stock purchase plan and to issue restricted stock under the long term incentive plan 
we anticipate continuing to use our funds for such purposes as approved by our board 
we could also use our funds to retire debt as appropriate  based on market conditions and our desired liquidity and capital structure 
risk factors that could possibly affect the availability of our internally generated funds include reduced sales due to declining booking volumes and lower prices under the dca year pricing option diversion of bookings from our channel offering and other competitive pressures changes in our working capital however  with our strong cash position of million and working capital of million as of december   we have significant resources available to us and we continue to implement cost controlling efforts to ensure our operating expenses are in line with the impacts of the factors listed above and other factors 
we periodically evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity and or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders  or restructure our long term debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
we cannot be assured that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
risk factors that could possibly affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include volatility in the markets for corporate debt in general disruptions in the travel industry could preclude access to the capital markets a ratings downgrade could limit our ability to access the corporate debt market violation of covenants could prevent us from drawing under our credit facility cash investments we invest cash in highly liquid instruments  including high credit quality money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit  banker s acceptances  commercial paper  repurchase agreements  mortgage backed and receivables backed securities and corporate and government notes  including tax exempt municipal securities 
we try to invest all excess cash in marketable securities 
therefore  our annual investments will fluctuate depending on the levels of cash provided or used by all of our other investing  operating and financing activities 
we invested excess cash of approximately million and million in marketable securities  net of marketable securities sold  during and  respectively 
in  we used cash from the sale of marketable securities  net of marketable securities purchased  of approximately million in other investing and financing activities 
capital activities common stock 
in april  we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of class a common stock at per share  which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million  net of transaction fees 
we are using the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes 
dividends 
we paid no dividends on our common stock during and we began paying a quarterly dividend of 
per share during the second quarter of  and paid dividends of the same amount during the third and fourth quarters of on january  we announced an increased dividend of 
per share for the first quarter of  and subsequently paid that dividend on february  if quarterly dividends in that amount were to be continued  and assuming that the current number of outstanding shares of our common stock remains constant  we would expect to pay an aggregate of million for each dividend  or approximately million on an annual basis 
our board of directors currently intends to consider declaring and paying comparable future dividends on a regular quarterly basis  subject to our ability to pay dividends and to a determination of our board of directors that dividends continue to be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
repurchases of stock 
during  and  we repurchased   and  shares of class a common stock  respectively  pursuant to authorizations by our board of directors 
on october  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to million of our common stock 
at december   we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately million of our common stock under this program 
on october  our board of directors authorized the purchase shares of our common stock to satisfy our obligations to deliver shares under our employee stock purchase plan and our long term incentive plan the alternative share settlement program 
under these two separate authorizations   shares were repurchased for approximately million during the fourth quarter of the timing  volume and price of any future repurchases will be made pursuant to b trading plans  unless such plans are terminated at the discretion of management financing arrangements revolving credit agreement 
in february  we entered into a million  senior unsecured  revolving credit agreement that expires on september  we plan to renew this credit facility before it expires 
interest on this agreement is variable  based upon libor or the prime rate plus a margin  at our option 
at december   and  we did not have any outstanding borrowings under this agreement and the entire million is available for us to draw upon  if necessary 
we are currently in compliance with all covenant requirements under this agreement 
notes payable 
during  we borrowed approximately million  primarily to finance the acquisition of getthere 
we repaid these borrowings during primarily using proceeds from the sale of our outsourcing business and the issuance in august of by sabre holdings corporation of million in unsecured notes notes  bearing interest at and maturing august   in an underwritten public offering resulting in net cash proceeds to us of approximately million 
we are currently in compliance with all covenant requirements under this agreement 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt transactions 
sabre inc  a owned subsidiary of sabre holdings corporation  unconditionally guarantees all debt obligations of sabre holdings corporation  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with these notes  we have entered into two interest rate swaps through for a total of million  which pay us and on which we pay a variable rate based on a six month libor plus basis points 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these swaps 
capital lease obligations in june  we entered into a ten year master lease for our corporate headquarters facility in southlake  texas  which is accounted for as a capital lease 
at the inception of the lease  we recorded an asset of approximately million  along with a liability of approximately million  representing the present value of the minimum lease payments due under the lease and the residual value guarantee discussed below 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to terminate the lease and purchase the properties for approximately million  plus a make whole amount  if applicable 
we also have the option at any time up to one year prior to lease expiration to cause the properties to be sold 
if the sell option is exercised  we have guaranteed that proceeds on a sale will be at least approximately million  and we are responsible for the first dollar loss up to approximately million due to a decrease in the value of the property below approximately million 
if the sales proceeds exceed approximately million plus any sales related expenses  we retain the excess

cash flows year ended december  cash provided by operating activities    cash used for investing activities    cash provided by used for financing activities   operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities declined by million from to due primarily to decreases in net earnings adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
cash provided by operating activities for was million  which was primarily from net earnings adjusted for non cash and non operating items 
non cash adjustments to net earnings of million for included depreciation and amortization of million  stock compensation expense of million  and a million loss on the refinancing of a facilities lease on our headquarters building 
cash provided by operating activities for was million and was primarily from net earnings adjusted for non cash and non operating items offset by uses of cash for working capital items  which includes accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  accrued compensation and benefits  accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
non cash adjustments to net earnings of million for included depreciation and amortization of million  deferred tax benefits of million  tax benefits for stock options exercised of million  stock compensation expense of million and an million gain on the sale of our former headquarter s building 
cash provided by operating activities declined by million from to resulting primarily from cash flows received during for accounts receivable from the outsourcing business  which was sold to eds in july  with no corresponding billings and collections in investing activities 
the million decrease in cash used for investing activities from to  primarily results from a million reduction in cash spent on acquisitions 
we expended cash for acquisitions of million in compared to expending million in acquisitions in included purchasing the assets of world choice travel  inc for million  purchasing the remaining interest that we did not own in dillon communication systems for million  making million in payments on outstanding shares of travelocity 
com related to the acquisition and million for other miscellaneous acquisition activity 
acquisitions in included the cash tender offer for the outstanding publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com for million  the acquisition of sitecom  inc for million  including cash received of million  and million in other miscellaneous acquisition activity 
capital expenditures were slightly higher in than in due to an increase in capitalized labor costs of million for investments in new platforms for sabre travel network  our reservations hosting software for sabre airline solutions and a dynamic packaging tool for travelocity totaltrip 
this increase was offset by a decrease in purchases of equipment of million due to leasing equipment for our technology enhancements rather than buying it 
the million increase in cash used for investing activities from to primarily results from the proceeds of million from the sale of our outsourcing business to eds coupled with a million increase in cash spent on acquisitions in the increase in cash spent on acquisitions was attributable to the cash tender offer for the outstanding publicly held common shares of travelocity 
com for million  the acquisition of site for million  including cash received of million  and the purchase of the data center facility from the lessor  netted against the proceeds of selling the same data center to eds  of million in these increases in cash used during were offset by a reduction in cash invested in marketable securities of million  a reduction in capital expenditures of million due to reduced acquisitions of it assets resulting from our it infrastructure outsourcing services contract with eds and million of cash received from the sale of our former headquarters building in the remaining million offset to the increase in cash used for investing was due to other miscellaneous investing activities 
financing activities 
the million decrease in cash provided by financing activities from to was mainly due to receiving million in proceeds from the public offering of our common stock in the decrease in cash provided from financing activities also included million in payments during to our stockholders in dividends and million to our former leaseholders to terminate a lease on our headquarters buildings 
the remaining million decrease results primarily from lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the million increase in cash provided by financing activities from to resulted primarily from the repayment of million in notes payable related to the getthere acquisition in coupled with the million in proceeds received from the public offering of our common stock in these increases in cash provided by financing activities were offset by the million in proceeds from the issuance of the million in unsecured notes in and a reduction in the proceeds received from exercise of stock options and issuance of stock under the employee stock purchase plan of million and a million increase in the cash used to purchase treasury stock 
during the third quarter of  we made an unsecured million loan to a customer in the travel industry  which was repaid in march critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that we adopt and follow certain accounting policies 
certain amounts presented in the financial statements have been determined based upon estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ 
we have included below a discussion of the accounting policies involving material estimates and assumptions that we believe are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements  how we apply such policies and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these accounting policies with our audit committee 
although we believe these policies to be the most critical  other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements and certain of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses each of our significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable we generate a significant portion of our revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from services provided to commercial airlines 
as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable were attributable to these customers 
our other accounts receivable are generally due from other participants in the travel and transportation industry 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  failure to pay amounts due to us or others  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past write off history average percentage of receivables written off historically and the length of time the receivables are past due 
during  and  the commercial air travel industry in particular  and the travel and transportation industry in general  was adversely affected by a decline in travel resulting from a softening economy 
our airline customers are negatively affected by the continuing lower levels of travel activity 
several major domestic air carriers are experiencing liquidity problems 
some airlines have sought bankruptcy protection and others may consider bankruptcy relief 
we believe that we have appropriately considered the effects of these factors  as well as any other known customer liquidity issues  on the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
however  if demand for commercial air travel softens  due to prevailing economic conditions  terrorist acts  war or other incidents involving commercial air transport  or other factors  the financial condition of our customers may be adversely impacted 
if we begin  or estimate that we will begin  to experience higher than expected defaults on amounts due us  our estimates of the amounts that we will ultimately collect could be reduced by a material amount 
in  we reduced our allowance for bad debt by million to a balance of million at december   mainly driven by the write off of million of aged receivables against reserves we had established in prior years for those specific receivables 
the amounts written off related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy in previous years and we have exhausted all methods of collection 
booking fee cancellation reserve we record revenue for airline travel reservations processed through the sabre system at the time of the booking of the reservation 
however  if the booking is canceled in a later month  the booking fee must be refunded to the customer less a small cancellation fee 
therefore we record revenue net of an estimated amount reserved to account for future cancellations 
this reserve is calculated based on historical cancellation rates 
in estimating the amount of future cancellations that will require us to refund a booking fee  we assume that a significant percentage of cancellations are followed by an immediate re booking  without loss of revenue 
this assumption is based on historical rates of cancellations re bookings and has a significant impact on the amount reserved 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected cancellation rates or changes in booking behavior  our estimates of future cancellations could be increased by a material amount and our revenue decreased by a corresponding amount 
at december  and  our booking fee cancellation reserves were approximately million and million  respectively 
in  the cancellation reserve declined by million due to declining booking levels and a rate change under the dca year pricing option agreements 
this reserve is sensitive to changes in booking levels and the number of bookings priced under the terms of the dca year pricing option agreements 
for example  if booking volumes had been lower or the weighted average booking fee rate had been lower  the reserve balance would have been reduced by million 
business combinations during  and  we completed a number of acquisitions of other companies using the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in connection with these acquisitions were based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
the fair values were determined by our management  generally based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities and valuations prepared by independent appraisal experts 
the valuations have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
for certain classes of intangible assets  the valuations have been based upon estimated cost of replacement 
in connection with these acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets  including goodwill 
long lived assets and goodwill prior to january   we reviewed all of our long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets  for impairment when changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if we determined that such indicators were present  we prepared an undiscounted future net cash flow projection for the asset 
in preparing this projection  we made a number of assumptions concerning such things as future booking volume levels  price levels  commission rates  rates of growth in our consumer and corporate direct booking businesses  rates of increase in operating expenses  etc 
if our projection of undiscounted future net cash flows was in excess of the carrying value of the recorded asset  no impairment was recorded 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeded the projected undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment was recorded 
the amount of the impairment charge was determined by discounting the projected net cash flows 
intangible assets subject to amortization continue to be evaluated for impairment as discussed above 
through the end of  we evaluated goodwill for impairment based on undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if the carrying value of the goodwill was less than the undiscounted projected future cash flows  no impairment would be recognized 
upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
on january   we began to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the unit of our business to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the unit 
these cash flow projections are based upon a number of assumptions  as discussed above 
under sfas no 
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to impairment tests annually or when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  as generally estimated using a discounted future net cash flow projection  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value 
in we wrote off an intangible asset of approximately million associated with a supplier agreement that was terminated early 
no other significant impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets have been recorded 
we believe that assumptions we have made in projecting future cash flows for the evaluations described above are reasonable 
however  if future actual results do not meet our expectations  we may be required to record an impairment charge  the amount of which could be material to our results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
seasonality the travel industry is seasonal in nature 
bookings  and our revenues for the use of the sabre system  decrease significantly each year in the fourth quarter  primarily in december 
customers generally book their november and december holiday leisure travel earlier in the year  and business travel declines during the holiday season 
all quarters presented were negatively affected by unfavorable economic conditions in the united states  political and economic issues abroad  ongoing travel security concerns and fear of potential terrorist attacks 
the first half of was affected by travelers fear of exposure to contagious diseases such as sars

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement was applicable prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
in december  the fasb modified fin to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen 
fin provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vies and determining when a company should include the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements 
in general  a vie is a corporation  partnership  limited liability corporation  trust  or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support  has a group of equity owners that are unable to make significant decisions about its activities  or has a group of equity owners that do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations 
fin requires a vie to be consolidated if a party with an ownership  contractual or other financial interest in the vie is obligated to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the vies activities  is entitled to receive a majority of the vies residual returns if no party absorbs a majority of the vies losses  or both 
a variable interest holder that consolidates the vie is called the primary beneficiary 
upon consolidation  the primary beneficiary generally must initially record all the vies assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests at fair value and subsequently account for the vie as if it were consolidated based on majority voting interest 
fin also requires disclosures about vies that the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
we do not have an interest in any special purpose entity that is required to be consolidated under fin we are currently evaluating our involvement in other entities pursuant to the revised guidance  however  we do not anticipate a significant effect as a result of its application 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the standard requires companies that issue certain types of freestanding financial instruments to treat them as liabilities on their balance sheet  measured at fair value  even though the instruments have characteristics of equity 
generally this standard is effective for the interim period beginning july  currently  we do not have any financial instruments that are impacted by the new standard 
on december   the staff of the securities and exchange commission or sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  which supersedes staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

sab s primary purpose is to rescind the accounting guidance contained in sab no 
related to multiple element revenue arrangements that was superseded as a result of the issuance of eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
additionally  sab rescinds the sec s related revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers issued with sab no 
that had been codified in sec topic  revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has changed to reflect the issuance of eitf  the revenue recognition principles of sab no 
remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab  which was effective upon issuance 
the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
mergers and acquisitions during we completed the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of world choice travel  inc and we acquired the share of dillon communications that we did not own 
we also completed other acquisitions during which did not materially affect our financial statements 
during we completed the tender offer for the outstanding publicly held shares of travelocity 
com common stock that we did not previously own  completed the acquisition of site com  inc and completed other acquisitions which did not materially affect our financial statements 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
sabre holdings corporation cautionary statement statements in this report which are not purely historical facts or which necessarily depend upon future events  including statements regarding our anticipations  beliefs  expectations  hopes  intentions or strategies for the future  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all forward looking statements in this report are based upon information available to us on the date of this report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
any forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events or results described in the forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
risk factors risks associated with an investment in our securities  and with achieving the forward looking statements contained in this report or in our news releases  websites  public filings  investor and analyst conferences or elsewhere  include  but are not limited to  the risk factors described below 
any of the risk factors described below could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may not succeed in addressing these challenges and risks 
our revenues are highly dependent on the travel and transportation industries  and particularly on airlines  and a prolonged substantial decrease in travel bookings volumes could adversely affect us 
most of our revenue is derived from airlines  hotel operators  car rental companies  cruise operators and other suppliers in the travel and transportation industries 
our revenue increases and decreases with the level of travel and transportation activity and is therefore highly subject to declines in or disruptions to travel and transportation due to factors entirely out of our control 
the travel industry is seasonal and our revenue varies significantly from quarter to quarter 
factors that may adversely affect travel and transportation activity include economic downturns and recessions  global security issues  acts of terrorism  future hostilities and war  increased airport security that could reduce the convenience of air travel  inclement weather  fuel price escalation  increased occurrence of travel related accidents  travelers concerns about exposure to contagious diseases such as sars  economic and political issues in the middle east  asia  latin america and elsewhere  and the financial condition of travel suppliers 
the economic downturn that preceded and was worsened by the september  terrorist attacks may continue to adversely affect us and the travel industry 
additionally  the continuing conflict in iraq  the possibility of further terrorist attacks  hostilities and war in the middle east  the indian subcontinent or elsewhere and the resulting security measures at airports  and the financial instability of many of the air carriers may continue to adversely affect the travel industry 
airlines may reduce the number of their flights  making fewer offerings available to us 
several major airlines are experiencing liquidity problems  some have sought bankruptcy protection and still others may consider bankruptcy relief 
travelers perceptions of passenger security or airlines financial stability may have an adverse effect on demand 
a prolonged substantial decrease in travel bookings volumes could have an adverse impact on our financial performance  operations  liquidity  or capital resources and could impair our ability to recover the carrying value of certain of our assets  including capitalized software  other intangible assets and goodwill 
we face competition from established and emerging travel distribution channels  which could divert customers to our competitors and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business includes channels of distribution that support the travel agency  business direct and consumer direct segments of the global travel distribution market 
in all of these distribution channels  we face significant competition 
in the travel agency channel  our sabre global distribution system competes primarily against other large and well established global distribution systems 
with the deregulation of the crs industry in the united states  our crs business will be competing in a free market system 
our current and potential customers may elect to use a competing gds offering lower prices 
furthermore  one or more airlines other than those participating in our dca year pricing option may elect to discontinue or to lower their levels of participation in our global distribution system  given the expiration in the united states of non discriminatory crs participation rules although only iberia  lufthansa and air france are currently subject to these rules 
losing access to supplier inventory would make our global distribution system less attractive to travel agencies and travel purchasers  which could reduce our booking fee revenue 
in order to gain access to suppliers inventory  it might become necessary for us to reduce the fees charged to suppliers  which could reduce our booking fee revenue 
in addition  we face increasing competition in the travel agency channel  including competition from travel suppliers that distribute directly to travel agencies 
in the business direct channel  travelocity business competes against similar offerings from other travel agencies 
some competitors market business travel systems that are bundled with financial and other non travel software systems that we do not offer 
as a result  our current and potential customers may choose the convenience or cost effectiveness of our competitors bundled products and services 
in the consumer direct channel  our travelocity offering competes not only against similar offerings from affiliates of other global distribution systems  but also with a large number of online travel agencies  including those operated by airlines and other travel suppliers 
we expect existing competitors  business partners and new entrants to the travel business to constantly revise and improve their business models in response to challenges from competing businesses  including ours 
if these or other travel industry participants introduce changes or developments that we cannot meet in a timely or cost effective manner  our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  consumers frequently use our websites for route pricing and other travel information  and then choose to purchase travel offerings from a source other than our website  including travel suppliers own websites 
such use may increase our costs without producing revenue 
in addition  consolidation among our competitors may give our competitors increased negotiating leverage with travel suppliers and corresponding competitive advantages over us 
consolidation among travel suppliers  including airline mergers  may increase competition from distribution channels related to those suppliers and place more leverage in the hands of those suppliers to negotiate lower booking fees 
if we are unable to compete effectively  competitors could divert our customers away from our travel distribution channels and  unless we substitute alternative revenue streams  it could adversely affect our results of operations 
some travel suppliers are seeking to bypass intermediaries  which may have the effect of adversely affecting our results of operations 
some travel suppliers are seeking to decrease their reliance on distribution intermediaries  including global distribution systems such as our sabre gds 
travel suppliers may give advantages to distribution intermediaries in which they have an economic stake 
for instance  airlines own a significant stake in amadeus and orbitz 
various airlines  hotels  car rental companies and cruise operators have established their own travel distribution websites 
several airlines and hotels have formed joint ventures that offer multi supplier travel distribution websites 
from time to time travel suppliers offer advantages  such as bonus miles  lower transaction fees  or discounted prices  when their products and services are purchased from these supplier related websites 
some of these offers have not been made to unrelated intermediaries 
in addition  the airline industry has experienced a shift in market share from full service carriers to low cost carriers that focus primarily on discount fares to leisure destinations 
some low cost carriers do not distribute their tickets through the sabre gds or through other third party intermediaries 
these developments may have the effect of diverting customers from our distribution system to supplier related websites and have the potential to put downward pressure on gds pricing 
consolidation in the travel agency industry and increased competition for travel agency subscribers may result in increased expenses  lost bookings and reduced revenue 
the number of bookings produced by our travel agency subscriber base is an important factor in our success 
some travel suppliers have reduced or eliminated commissions paid to travel agencies including consumer direct travel sites like travelocity 
the loss of commissions causes travel agencies to become more dependent on other sources of revenues  such as traveler paid service fees and gds paid incentives 
the reduction or elimination of supplier paid commissions has forced some smaller travel agencies to close or to combine with larger travel agencies 
although we have a leading share of large travel agencies  competition is particularly intense among global distribution systems for larger travel agency subscribers 
consolidation of travel agencies may result in increased competition for these subscribers 
in order to compete effectively  we may need to increase incentives  pre pay incentives  increase spending on marketing or product development  or make significant investments to purchase strategic assets 
travelocity s growth cannot be assured 
the online travel space is highly competitive  with both the independent internet travel agencies and suppliers proprietary websites competing for customers 
our business strategy is dependent on expanding travelocity s transaction revenues  increasing its percentage of merchant transactions  maintaining the breadth of its merchant suppliers  and increasing its site traffic including from travelocity s distribution partners 
key components of this strategy include the growth of revenue from our merchant model hotel business  last minute packaging and the totaltrip dynamic packaging offering 
we also plan to broaden the appeal of travelocity business to corporate travelers 
if any of these initiatives is not successful  travelocity s growth may be limited and it may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability 
our business plans call for the significant growth of our merchant model business  and we may be unsuccessful in managing or expanding that business 
our business strategy is dependent upon our merchant model business  primarily our merchant model hotel business  as a significant source of revenue 
we remain subject to numerous risks in the operation and growth of this business 
our merchant model hotel strategy is particularly dependent upon our ability to obtain an adequate number of hotel rooms to offer  through travelocity or through our sabre exclusives program  which require pre payment by the consumer at the time of booking 
our strategy calls for us to increase the number of hotel rooms we can offer under our merchant model hotel program based upon merchant arrangements we make directly with individual hotel properties and hotel chains 
under our merchant model hotel program  we contract with hotels for access to rooms at a negotiated rate and then we determine the price at which we offer the rooms to travelers 
there are significant risks associated with the merchant model 
in particular  we cannot ensure that we will continue to be successful in signing up hotel properties in a sufficient number of domestic or international geographic markets 
many hoteliers utilize merchant arrangements with us and with our competitors as a channel to dispose of excess hotel rooms at discounted rates 
we may be unable to achieve our financial objectives for the merchant model hotel program  especially if economic conditions improve or if competition increases 
if improved economic conditions create increased demand for hotel rooms  hotel managers may reduce the amount of merchant hotel rooms made available to us and may increase the negotiated rates at which they provide merchant hotel rooms to us 
similarly  heightened competition from our competitors own merchant rate programs may result in offering reductions and increases in negotiated rates for our merchant model rooms 
these types of events could exert downward pressure on the margins we expect to achieve in our merchant hotel business 
similar risks could also impact our businesses should we choose to explore applying the merchant model to our other lines of business  such as air travel  in the future 
we may be unsuccessful in pursuing and integrating business combinations and strategic alliances  which could result in increased expenditures or cause us to fail to achieve anticipated cost savings or revenue growth 
we plan to examine possible business combinations  investments  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies in order to maintain and grow revenue and market presence 
we may be unable to successfully complete these acquisitions due to multiple factors  such as issues related to regulatory review of the proposed transactions 
in addition  there are risks inherent in these types of transactions  such as difficulty in assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  disruption of our ongoing business  including loss of management focus on existing businesses and market developments  problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel  expenses associated with the amortization of identifiable intangible assets  additional or unanticipated operating losses  expenses or liabilities of acquired businesses  impairment of relationships with existing employees  customers and business partners  and fluctuations in value and losses that may arise from equity investments 
in addition  we may not be able to identify suitable candidates for additional business combinations and strategic investments  obtain financing on acceptable terms for such business combinations and strategic investments  or otherwise consummate such business combinations and strategic investments on acceptable terms 
we cannot assure you that our ongoing cost reduction plans will be successful 
our strategy depends  to a substantial degree  on reducing and controlling operating expenses 
in furtherance of this strategy  we have engaged in ongoing  company wide activities intended to reduce costs 
these activities included significant personnel reductions  reductions in travelocity fulfillment costs in part through global sourcing and realigning and streamlining operations and consolidating facilities 
we cannot assure you that our efforts will result in the increased profitability  cost savings or other benefits that we expect 
rapid technological changes and new distribution channels or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may adversely affect the value of our current or future technologies to us and our customers  which could cause us to increase expenditures to upgrade and protect our technology or develop and protect competing offerings in new distribution channels 
new distribution channels and technology in our industry are evolving rapidly 
our ability to compete and our future results depend in part on our ability to make timely and cost effective enhancements and additions to our technology  to introduce new products and services that meet customer demands  to keep pace with rapid advancements in technology  and to protect our technology 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on us  and our legal remedies may not adequately compensate us for the damages to our business caused by such use 
maintaining flexibility to respond to technological and market dynamics may require substantial expenditures and lead time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify and develop new products or services in a timely manner  that offerings  technologies or services developed by others will not render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive  or that the technologies in which we focus our research and development investments will achieve acceptance in the marketplace and provide a return on our investment 
our systems may suffer failures  capacity constraints and business interruptions  which could increase our operating costs and cause us to lose customers 
our businesses are largely dependent on the computer data centers and network systems operated for us by electronic data systems corporation 
we rely on several communications service suppliers and on the global internet to provide network access between our computer data center and end users of our services 
like any company in our industry  we occasionally experience system interruptions that make some or all of our global distribution system or other data processing services unavailable  which may prevent us from efficiently providing services to our customers or other third parties 
system capacity limits or constraints arising from unexpected increases in our volume of business could cause interruptions  outages or delays in our services  or a deterioration in their performance  or could impair our ability to process transactions 
much of the computer and communications hardware upon which we depend is located in a single facility 
our systems might be damaged or interrupted by fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins  earthquakes  terrorist attacks  hostilities or war or similar events 
computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions affecting the global internet or our systems might cause service interruptions  delays and loss of critical data  and could prevent us from providing our services 
problems affecting our systems might be expensive to remedy and could significantly diminish our reputation and brand name and prevent us from providing services 
we could be harmed by outages in  or unreliability of  the data center or network systems 
state and local tax issues have the potential to have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
some state and local taxing authorities impose taxes on the sale  use or occupancy of hotel room accommodations  which are called transient  occupancy  accommodation  sales or hotel room taxes 
hotel operators generally collect and remit these occupancy taxes 
consistent with that practice  when a customer books a hotel room through one of our travel services  we collect from the customer an amount sufficient to pay the hotel its room charge and the occupancy taxes on that charge  as well as additional amount representing our fee 
we do not collect or remit occupancy taxes on our fee 
some tax authorities claim that occupancy taxes should be collected on some or all of that fee 
we believe there are strong arguments that our fee is not subject to occupancy taxes although tax laws vary among the jurisdictions 
we are attempting to resolve this issue with tax authorities in various jurisdictions  but we cannot predict the resolution in any particular jurisdiction 
we have established a reserve for potential occupancy tax liability  consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances 
the reserve represents our best estimate of our contingent liability for occupancy taxes 
a variety of factors could affect any actual liability for occupancy taxes  such as the number of jurisdictions that prevail in either assessing additional occupancy taxes or negotiating a settlement with us  the fees potentially subject to tax in each jurisdiction  changes in applicable tax laws  and the timing of any or all of the foregoing 
we cannot assure you that the amount of our liability on occupancy taxes will not exceed that reserve and will not have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
regulatory developments abroad could limit our ability to compete by restricting our flexibility to respond to competitive conditions  which could cause our customers to be diverted to our competitors and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
the commission of the european union the commission and transport canada are engaged in a comprehensive review of their rules governing crs systems 
it is unclear at this time when these bodies will complete their reviews and what changes  if any  will be made to their respective crs rules 
we could be unfairly and adversely affected if  for example  these rules are retained as to traditional global distribution systems used by travel agencies but are not applied to travel distribution websites owned by more than one airline 
we could also be adversely affected if restrictions are imposed or continued on crs advertising and displays or if additional limitations are placed upon our right to contract with travel agents or airlines 
we could also be adversely affected if changes to any of the foregoing crs rules increase our cost of doing business  weaken the non discriminatory participation rules to allow one or more large airlines owning a competing crs to discontinue or to lower its level of participation in our global distribution system  or cause us to be subject to rules that do not also apply to our global distribution competitors 
our international operations are subject to other risks  which may impede our ability to grow internationally and adversely affect our overall results of operations 
we face risks inherent in international operations  such as risks of currency exchange rate fluctuations  local economic and political conditions  including conditions resulting from the conflict in iraq and potential conflict between india and pakistan  restrictive governmental actions  such as trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  limitations on the repatriation of funds  difficulty in obtaining distribution and support  different accounting practices and potentially longer payment cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity  consumer protection laws and restrictions on pricing or discounts  lack of  or the failure to implement  the appropriate infrastructure to support our technology  lesser protection in some jurisdictions for our intellectual property  laws and policies of the us affecting trade  foreign investment and loans and foreign tax and other laws 
these risks may adversely affect our ability to conduct and grow business internationally  which could cause us to increase expenditures and costs  decrease our revenue growth or both 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   our exposure to interest rates relates primarily to our marketable securities portfolio 
largely offsetting this exposure are our notes payable  as hedged with fixed to floating interest rate swaps 
the objectives of our marketable securities are safety of principal  liquidity maintenance  yield maximization and full investment of all available funds 
as such  our investment portfolio consists primarily of high credit quality certificates of deposit  money market mutual funds  bankers acceptances  commercial paper  repurchase agreements  mortgage backed and receivables backed securities and corporate and government notes including tax exempt municipal securities 
if short term interest rates average lower in than they were during  our interest income from marketable securities would decrease by approximately million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if short term interest rates averaged lower in than they were during  our interest income from marketable securities would have decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our marketable securities balances as of december  and in addition  we had fixed rate notes of million notes as of december  we have entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps related to million of the outstanding notes  effectively converting million of the million fixed rate notes into floating rate obligations 
if short term interest rates average higher in than they were in  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our floating rate borrowings balance at december  in addition  we had a million capital lease at december  we have entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps related to million of the outstanding capital lease  effectively converting million of the million fixed rate capital lease into a floating rate obligation 
if short term interest rates average higher in than they were in  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
this amount was determined by applying the hypothetical interest rate change to our floating rate borrowings balance at december  foreign currency risk we have various foreign operations  primarily in north america  south america  europe  australia and asia 
as a result of these business activities  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
since a significant portion of our business is transacted in the united states dollar  these exposures have historically related to a small portion of our overall operations 
however  during times of devaluation of the us dollar  such as in  the increase in our foreign expenses can have a negative impact on our operating results 
to reduce the impact of this earnings volatility  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure by entering into foreign currency forward contracts on our three largest foreign currency exposures 
these contracts  totaling million at december  and million at december   represented obligations to purchase foreign currencies at a predetermined exchange rate  to fund a portion of our expenses that are denominated in foreign currency exposures 
the result of an immediate percent devaluation of the us dollar in from december  levels relative to our primary foreign currency exposures would result in an increase in the us dollar equivalent of foreign currency denominated expenses of approximately million  net of hedge instruments outstanding 
this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projections of our primary foreign currency denominated expenses and foreign currency forward contracts as of december
