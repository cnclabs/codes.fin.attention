item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop targeted contrast agents designed to improve the diagnostic quality of images produced by mri 
since commencing operations in  we have been principally engaged in research and development activities related to our product candidates  as well as seeking various regulatory clearances and patent protection 
we have had no revenues from sales of our products and have incurred cumulative losses since inception through december  aggregating approximately million 
most of our revenues to date have come from license fees and product development revenues from collaboration agreements for our product candidates 
following approval of the ms nda  currently under review by the fda  we believe that we have a significant opportunity related to revenues generated from sales of ms our ability to generate revenues from sales of ms and other products will depend on the success and timing of clinical trials and regulatory approvals for our products and on the success of commercialization efforts by us and our collaborators 
the successful commercialization of ms and other products will also depend on the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of competing products and on the intellectual property claims in the field of diagnostic imaging 
more broadly  the markets for our products will be subject to the effects of a number of additional factors  including developments in reimbursement policies in the us and other countries and changes in the cost of and demand for diagnostic procedures for cardiovascular disease 
we expect continued operating losses for at least the next two years as we incur expenses to support research and development efforts and to support commercialization of our initial product candidate  ms our financial results have been affected significantly by the scope and speed of our clinical trial program and by our interaction with the fda related to an appropriate clinical trial program for regulatory approval 
to date  all of our clinical trial activity has been undertaken to study ms ms is an injectable contrast agent specifically designed for vascular imaging using magnetic resonance angiography  or mra 
we filed an investigational new drug ind application for ms in july we initiated a phase i clinical trial in and a phase i dose escalation study in  both of which have been completed 
we completed a phase ii clinical trial in june to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of ms enhanced mra  for the evaluation of non coronary vascular disease and also completed a phase ii trial in june that was designed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of five different doses of ms enhanced mra with that of x ray angiography in the aortoiliac arteries 
in  we completed enrollment in the first study of a two arm phase iii clinical trial  which was initiated in june  and was designed to determine the efficacy of ms enhanced mra for the detection of aortoiliac occlusive disease 
we announced the results of this trial in march in october  we announced that we had completed patient enrollment in the second of the two trials designed to detect peripheral vascular disease in the aortoiliac arteries 
we announced results of this trial in march in september  after discussions with the fda  we expanded our initial target indication for ms beyond aortoiliac occlusive disease to a broad peripheral vascular disease indication  which we expect will include the entire vasculature  except for the heart 
as a result of this expansion  we added two new trials to our phase iii mra clinical trial program  one in the renal arteries and the other in the pedal arteries 
in february  we announced that we had completed patient enrollment in these studies 
we announced the results of these two trials in july we submitted a new drug application  or nda  to the food and drug administration  or fda  in december and received a letter from the fda accepting our nda as fileable in february we are co developing ms with schering aktiengesellschaft  schering ag 
in march  we completed enrollment in a phase ii clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of ms for detecting breast cancer  and in march  we completed enrollment in a phase ii feasibility trial  which we conducted in collaboration with pfizer  inc  or pfizer  to explore the efficacy of ms enhanced mri in the diagnosis of female sexual arousal dysfunction 
in april  we completed enrollment in our ms enhanced mra phase ii feasibility trial for coronary artery disease 
we are collaborating with schering ag on the development of our second product candidate  ep r  for detecting human thrombus  or blood clots  using mri 
we have also established a research collaboration with schering ag for the discovery of novel drugs for use with mri 
we anticipate fluctuations in our results of operations due to several factors  including the timing of fees and milestone payments received from strategic partners  the formation of new strategic alliances between us and third parties  the timing and magnitude of expenditures in connection with research and development activities  the timing of product introductions and expense of associated launches  marketing and sales activities  and the timing and extent of product acceptance for different indications and geographical areas of the world 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in december  the us securities and exchange commission  or the commission  requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the commission indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and operating results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  not all significant accounting policies  however  require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  research and development and employee stock compensation  as described below  require critical accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from non refundable license fees and milestone payments not specifically tied to a separate earning process ratably over the period during which we have substantial continuing obligations to perform services under the contract 
when milestone payments are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligations associated with the payment are completed 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we estimate the period of deferral based upon our obligations under the contract 
we continually review these estimates and  if any of these estimates change  an adjustment is recorded in the period in which they become reasonably estimable 
these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 
in and  we have increased the estimated time period over which we will provide services under our agreement with mallinckrodt  inc  a subsidiary of tyco international ltd  which we refer to as tyco mallinckrodt  from an original estimate of months to a current estimate of months  resulting in a reduction in revenue of approximately  for the year ended december  in  we increased the estimated time period for obtaining approval for ms in japan from an original estimate of months to a current estimate of months  resulting in a reduction in revenue of approximately  for the year ended december  we will continue to review these estimates and make appropriate adjustments as information becomes available 
under the ms program  we recognize revenue at the time we perform research and development activities for which schering ag  and other collaborators are obligated to reimburse us 
product development revenues from schering ag are recorded net of the company s portion of schering ag s actual or most recent estimate of their ms research and development costs 
we recognize reimbursement from schering ag  for the ep r feasibility program  as revenue proportionate to actual cost incurred relative to expected total program costs 
total estimated costs of the feasibility program are based on management s assessment of costs to complete the feasibility program  which include an evaluation of the portion of the program completed  the costs incurred to date and the expected future costs of the program 
adjustments to revenue will be recorded if estimated costs to complete change 
to the extent that our estimated costs change materially  our revenues recorded under this activity could materially be affected and such change could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future periods 
in december  management increased its ep r estimate to complete the feasibility program  resulting in reduction in revenue of  in the fourth quarter of revenue under our research collaboration with schering ag to discover novel compounds for diagnosing human disease using mri is recognized as services are provided for which schering ag is obligated to reimburse us 
royalty revenues are recognized based on actual revenues as reported to us by bracco spa  or bracco 
when actual results are not available  we estimate royalty revenues based on bracco s estimates  historical revenues and trends 
we continually review these estimates and record adjustments to the estimates when we receive actual information from bracco 
these adjustments have not been significant to date  but could have a material effect on our future results of operations 
research and development research and development costs  including those associated with technology  licenses and patents  are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs include employee salaries and related costs  third party service costs  the costs of clinical and preclinical supplies and consulting expenses 
in order to conduct research and development activities and compile regulatory submissions  we enter into contracts with vendors who render services over an extended period of time  generally one to three years 
typically  we enter into two types of vendor contracts  time based and patient based 
under a time based contract  using critical factors contained within the contract  usually the stated duration of the contract and the timing of services provided  we record the contractual expense for each service provided under the contract ratably over the period during which we estimate the service will be performed 
under a patient based contract  we first determine an appropriate per patient cost using critical factors contained within the contract  which include the estimated number of patients and the total dollar value of the contract 
we then record expense based upon the total number of patients enrolled during the period 
on a quarterly basis  we review both the timetable of services to be rendered and the timing of services actually received 
based upon this review  revisions may be made to the forecasted timetable or to the extent of services performed  or both  in order to reflect our most current estimate of the contract 
adjustments are recorded in the period in which the revisions are estimable 
these adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations 
employee stock compensation we have elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options rather than the alternative fair value accounting provided for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
under apb  when the exercise price is greater than or equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
if we are unable to or decide not to continue to account for stock options under apb  our financial results would be materially adversely affected to the extent of the additional compensation expense that we would have to recognize  which could change significantly from period to period based on several factors including the number of stock options granted and fluctuations in our stock price and or interest rates 
see note to the financial statements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
revenues for consisted of million of product development revenue from schering ag  million of royalty and license fee revenue related to the bracco agreement and million of license fee revenue related to the schering ag and tyco mallinckrodt strategic collaboration agreements for the development and marketing of ms the increase in revenues of million for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year primarily related to product development revenue from the collaboration agreements signed in with schering ag for ep r and mri joint research of million  and to increased royalties from bracco of  partly offset by lower product development revenues from ms of million and lower license fee revenue related to the schering ag and tyco mallinckrodt strategic collaboration agreements of  product development revenue from ep r was reduced by approximately  in the fourth quarter of as a result of an increase in management s estimate of the costs to complete the fixed reimbursement agreement with schering ag 
license fee revenue related to the schering ag and tyco mallinckrodt agreements were also reduced by approximately  in compared to as a result of the increase in the estimated time frame for obtaining approval for ms in the united states and japan 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease of million was primarily attributable to decreased costs related to the completion of the phase iii clinical trial program for ms and to lower spending on our ep r program  partly offset by higher spending on our mri joint research program 
we are currently performing research and development activities for three projects ms  for which we have completed phase iii clinical trials and for which we submitted an nda to the fda in december  our feasibility program for ep r  which is in the preclinical stage and our mri joint research program 
ms is an injectable intravascular contrast agent intended to enhance the quality of mr images and provide physicians with a superior method for diagnosing diseases affecting the vasculature 
we have completed our phase iii clinical trial program to test the safety and efficacy of ms enhanced mra for the evaluation of non coronary vascular disease and submitted our nda for ms to the fda in december in february  we were notified by the fda that the nda for ms has been accepted for filing and has been designated for a standard review cycle 
the target date for the first fda action in the standard review cycle is ten months from the date of submission 
if approved by the fda  our partner  schering ag  will have primary responsibility for the product launch and marketing of ms in  we plan to initiate further phase ii clinical studies of ms for use in cardiac imaging and phase iiib iv clinical studies of ms we plan to initiate human clinical studies for ep r in both the time frame and costs involved in developing ms or ep r  gaining fda approval for ms and commercializing the product may vary greatly for several reasons  including the following we conduct our clinical trials in accordance with specific protocols  which we have filed with the fda or other relevant authorities 
if the fda requires us to perform additional studies  we could incur significant additional costs and additional time to complete our clinical trials 
this could also result in a delay in our ability to make regulatory submissions and a delay in the commercialization  increased competition or slower sales growth of our product 
we rely on third party clinical trial centers to find suitable patients for our clinical trial program 
if these third parties do not find suitable patients in the timeframe for which we have planned  we will not be able to complete our clinical trials according to our expected schedule 
such a delay could result in an increase in development costs for ms or ep r  a delay in making regulatory submissions and a delay in the commercialization  increased competition or slower sales growth of our product 
we rely on third party contract research organizations for a variety of activities in our development program  including conducting blinded reading activities  lab testing and analysis of clinical samples  data collection  cleanup and analysis and drafting study reports and regulatory submissions 
a delay in these activities would result in an increase in costs  a delay in making regulatory submissions and a delay in the commercialization  increased competition or slower sales growth of our product 
the length of time that the fda or other regulatory authorities takes to review our regulatory submissions and the length of time it takes us to respond to fda questions can also vary widely 
any delay in that process would result in an increase in costs and a delay in the commercialization or slower sales growth of our product 
our partner  schering ag  is responsible for the launch and marketing of ms if schering ag does not launch the product in a timely manner or market the product effectively  we may incur a delay in receiving revenues after the launch of ms or may not receive enough revenue to enable us to be profitable 
our current plans for developing and commercializing ms and ep r reflect our best estimate of the time involved in the development program based on factors currently known to us 
the third parties described above have the ability to greatly impact this timetable  and we may not have control over or be able to respond within our current plan to changes they cause 
any such delays could result in a significant increase in costs to develop ms or ep r as well as a delay in product launch  which could enable competition to intensify 
in november  we entered into an intellectual property agreement with dr 
martin prince in which dr 
prince made certain covenants and agreements  and granted to the company certain discharges and releases in connection with the use of any magnetic resonance imaging drug product containing ms dr 
prince also granted to the company a non exclusive license to make  use  sell or otherwise transfer ms in consideration of dr 
prince s covenants  discharges  releases and license  the company agreed to pay to dr 
prince an up front fee  to pay certain royalties on sales of ms consistent with a non exclusive  early stage academic license  to issue  shares of common stock to dr 
prince and to deliver certain quantities of ms the upfront fee and the value of the shares were recognized as research and development expense in royalties will be expensed as cost of goods sold as ms sales are recognized 
the cost of ms made available will be recognized as cost of goods sold as drug is delivered 
in may  we entered into a collaboration agreement with schering ag for the development and commercialization of ep r 
under terms of the agreement  we will be responsible for execution of a clinical feasibility program in humans 
at the end of the feasibility program  schering ag may exercise an option to develop ep r through which schering ag will receive an exclusive  worldwide license for ep r and become responsible for all further development  manufacturing  marketing and sales 
under the agreement  schering ag has made and will continue to make fixed payments to us totaling approximately million over two years intended to cover our costs of the feasibility program 
the amount of expenditure necessary to execute the feasibility program  currently estimated to be million  is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our ability to execute the program for less than the schering ag payments to us 
in addition  we cannot predict whether schering ag will exercise its option to develop ep r or  if schering ag does exercise its option  whether we will exercise our option to bear a portion of the development costs in return for an increase in our royalty rate 
if schering ag does not exercise its option  then we would have to bear the additional cost of a clinical program to develop ep r  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
consequently  we cannot predict  at this time  the amount of research and development costs that we will incur with regard to the development and commercialization of ep r 
in may  we also entered into an agreement with schering ag covering an exclusive research collaboration to discover novel compounds for diagnosing human disease using mri 
under terms of the three year joint research agreement  we and schering ag are exclusively combining our existing research programs in the field of mri to discover novel mri product candidates for clinical development 
under the agreement  schering ag will fund a portion of our related personnel costs and third party research costs of up to million per annum and will make available to us a loan facility of up to million with principal repayment beginning in the cost to execute our mri research plan is subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
the duration and cost of bringing a product to market may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of various matters arising during and after clinical trials  including among others  the following time needed for regulatory approval  number of patients  costs per patient and the rate of patient recruitment in the clinical trial program  complexity and cost of project management  data collection and data management services provided by outside vendors  and unanticipated adverse safety and efficacy results from the pre clinical or clinical trials 
we test our potential product candidates in numerous pre clinical studies to identify disease indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus on more promising product candidates or indications 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which consist primarily of salaries  benefits  outside professional services and related costs associated with our executive  finance and accounting  business development  marketing  human resources  legal and corporate communications activities  were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in of  was primarily due to an increase in legal costs related to executing the collaboration and intellectual property agreements discussed under research and development expenses  to higher liability insurance premiums and to ms marketing personnel and related costs 
general and administrative expenses also included royalties payable to massachusetts general hospital  or mgh  based on sales by bracco of multihance 
royalty expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income and interest expense interest income for the year ended december  was  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of approximately  was primarily due to lower interest rates in compared to  partly offset by higher average levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in compared to also contributing to the decrease was the net realized gains recognized on the sale of marketable securities recorded in of  which were included in interest income  compared to no realized gains recognized for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense in resulted from the reduction in the outstanding balance of interest bearing prepaid royalties from bracco and the payment of the promissory note to tyco mallinckrodt in october  which was partly offset by the draw down of the loan facility of million for a portion of the year  pursuant to the schering ag collaboration agreements 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes  which represents italian income taxes related to the bracco agreement  was  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  beginning in july  and until the earlier of fda approval of multihance or december   the portion of bracco royalty revenue earned that was previously paid to us in cash is primarily being offset against the prepaid fda approval license fee 
as a result  we will be required to withhold a lesser amount of foreign income tax expense until royalty payments are reinstated upon fda approval of multihance 
years ended december  and revenues revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
revenues for consisted of million of product development revenue from schering ag  million of royalty and license fee revenue related to the bracco agreement and million of license fee revenue related to the schering ag and tyco mallinckrodt strategic collaboration agreements for the development and marketing of ms the increase in revenue of million primarily related to product development revenue from schering ag 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the increase in of million was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with research and development personnel and clinical trials related to the advancement of ms through phase iii clinical trials and to increased costs for personnel and other resources to support research and development for our potential discovery phase products 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in of  was primarily due to increased ms marketing costs and personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses also included royalties payable to mgh based on sales by bracco of multihance 
royalty expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest income and interest expense interest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of approximately  was primarily due to realized gains from the sale of marketable securities and higher average levels of invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  partly offset by lower interest rates 
net realized gains on marketable securities were  for the year ended december  as compared to none for year the ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  this increase in interest expense in was the result of a full year of interest paid to bracco under the bracco agreement 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes  which represents italian income taxes related to the bracco agreement  was  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the higher foreign income tax expense in of approximately million is directly attributable to the receipt of million from bracco in september upon the execution of the worldwide license agreement with bracco 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities of million at december  as compared to million at december  in august  we raised million  net of underwriter discounts  commissions and expenses  through the issuance and sale of million shares of our common stock pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement  previously filed with the sec 
we used approximately million of net cash to fund operations for the year ended december   which is consistent with our usage of cash from operations in the prior year 
a net loss of million  combined with a reduction in deferred revenue of million and a reduction in accrued reacquisition costs of million resulting from the final up front payment to daiichi in december  partly offset by an increase in accrued expenses of million primarily related to the intellectual property agreement with dr 
martin prince  accounted for the net cash used in operations during the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used for operating activities was primarily attributable to our net loss of million 
our investing activities resulted in net cash used of million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used of million for the same period last year 
during  we purchased available for sale marketable securities of million  using a portion of the proceeds from the million common stock offering in august the purchase of available for sale marketable securities was partly offset by the cash generated from the redemption or sale of million of available for sale marketable securities 
during the same period in  we purchased approximately million of available for sale marketable securities  with most of the proceeds coming from our january common stock offering 
the purchase of available for sale marketable securities was partly offset by the sale or redemption of available for sale marketable securities of million 
other investing activities included capital expenditures of  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period last year 
our capital expenditures primarily consist of purchases of property and equipment  including lab equipment  computer equipment and software 
we expect that our capital expenditures may increase in the future as we continue to refurbish our principal laboratory space 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  the primary sources of financing during were the sale and issuance of million shares of common stock pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement  previously filed with the sec  which generated net proceeds of million  the million of loan proceeds from schering ag arising from our mri research collaboration entered into in may and the proceeds of million from stock option exercises and purchases of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
this compares with net proceeds of approximately million for the year ended december  the primary sources of financing during came from the issuance and sale of million shares of our common stock in january pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement  previously filed with the sec  which generated net proceeds of million  and proceeds of million from stock option exercises and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan  which was partly offset by the repayment of the promissory note to tyco mallinckrodt of million and the repayment of capital lease obligations of  we currently receive quarterly cash payments from schering ag for their share of development costs of ms and ep r and for their share of research costs in our mri research collaboration 
we also receive monthly interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities 
prior to july  we received quarterly royalty payments from bracco for a portion of the royalty revenue actually earned from the sales of multihance 
beginning in july  and until the earlier of fda approval of multihance or december   a portion of bracco royalty revenue earned that was previously paid to us in cash is primarily being offset against the prepaid fda approval license fee 
if multihance is approved in the us by the fda prior to december   bracco will be obligated to pay us the amount of royalties previously offset against prepaid fda approval license fee and resume quarterly royalty payments 
other potential cash inflows include a milestone payment of million from schering ag related to the acceptance of the filing of our nda with the fda  which occurred in february  another milestone payment of million from schering ag  which is dependent on the fda s approval of ms  and up to million in additional milestone payments from schering ag as well as our share of the profits earned on sales of ms worldwide 
additional future cash flows from our ep r collaboration with schering ag depend on the successful completion of the ep r feasibility program  on schering ag s decision to exercise its development option and on the success of further development  regulatory and commercialization work by schering ag 
additional future cash flows from our mri research collaboration with schering ag depend on the success of the research program and the success of further development  regulatory and commercialization activities with respect to any products generated 
we may also receive royalties on sales of schering ag s eovist product  if it is approved for sale by the fda or international regulatory authorities pursuant to a license agreement with schering ag 
known outflows  in addition to our ongoing research and development and general and administrative expenses  include the semi annual royalties that we owe to mgh on sales by bracco of multihance 
other potential future outflows include a milestone payment of million to tyco mallinckrodt related to the acceptance of our filing of an nda with the fda  which occurred in february  a milestone payment of million  which is dependent on the fda s approval of ms  a share of profits due tyco mallinckrodt on sales of ms worldwide  a royalty to daiichi on sales of ms in japan and a royalty due mgh on our share of the profits of ms worldwide 
we will also be required to repay bracco any unearned prepaid royalties  equaling million at december   upon termination of our license agreement with bracco  plus an additional million if multihance does not receive fda approval in the u 
s by december in november  bracco announced that it had received an approvable letter from the fda for multihance 
based on our current plans  expense rates  targeted timelines and our view regarding acceptance of ms in the marketplace  we estimate that cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand as of december  will be sufficient to fund our operations until we turn cash flow positive 
as of december   we had outstanding million of our million loan facility available from schering ag as part of our mri research collaboration  of which the additional million will not be available until may we repaid the million loan  plus accrued interest  in january  but expect to redraw the million loan as needed 
we expect to be able to draw the remaining million from the schering ag loan facility in may  but could be unable to draw under the terms of the loan if we fail to meet certain covenants or conditions precedent in the loan 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and scope of clinical trials  the timing and costs of filing future regulatory submissions  the timing and costs required to receive both us and foreign governmental approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the extent to which our products  if any  gain market acceptance  the timing and costs of product introductions  the extent of our ongoing research and development programs  the costs of training physicians to become proficient with the use of our potential products  and  if necessary  once regulatory approvals are received  the costs of developing marketing and distribution capabilities 
because of anticipated spending to support new research programs as well as the continued development of ms and ep r  we do not expect positive cash flow from operating activities for any future quarterly or annual period prior to commercialization of ms our ability to reach positive cash flow subsequent to the commercialization of ms will depend on its market acceptance and successful launch by our partner schering ag  as well as the ability of our partner tyco mallinckrodt to manufacture sufficient quantities of ms to support schering ag s sales and marketing activities 
we anticipate continued investments in fixed assets  including equipment and facilities expansion to support new and continuing research and development programs 
in october  we signed a lease agreement that increased our future lease commitments by million and will enable us to utilize our current principal office facilities through december  below is a table that represents payments due under our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years short term debt obligations   operating lease obligations    purchase obligations    deferred revenue    total     we have incurred tax losses to date and therefore have not paid significant federal or state income taxes since inception 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to offset future taxable income 
these amounts expire at various times through as a result of ownership changes resulting from sales of equity securities  our ability to use the net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations as defined in sections and of the internal revenue code of  or the code  as amended 
we currently estimate that the annual limitation on our use of net operating losses through may  to be approximately  pursuant to sections and of the code  the change in ownership resulting from public equity offerings in and any other future ownership changes may further limit utilization of losses and credits in any one year 
we also are eligible for research and development tax credits that can be carried forward to offset federal taxable income 
the annual limitation and the timing of attaining profitability may result in the expiration of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
certain factors that may affect future results of operations this report contains certain forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
we caution investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the uncertainties associated with pre clinical studies and clinical trials  our lack of product revenues  our history of operating losses and accumulated deficit  our lack of commercial manufacturing experience and commercial sales  distribution and marketing capabilities  reliance on suppliers of key materials necessary for production of our products and technologies  the potential development by competitors of competing products and technologies  our dependence on existing and potential collaborative partners  and the lack of assurance that we will receive any funding under such relationships to develop and maintain strategic alliances  the lack of assurance regarding patent and other protection for our proprietary technology  governmental regulation of our activities  facilities  products and personnel  the dependence on key personnel  uncertainties as to the extent of reimbursement for the costs of our potential products and related treatments by government and private health insurers and other organizations  the potential adverse impact of government directed health care reform  the risk of product liability claims  and economic conditions  both generally and those specifically related to the biotechnology industry 
as a result  our future development efforts involve a high degree of risk 
for further information  refer to the more specific risks and uncertainties discussed throughout this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  in accordance with our investment policy  we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally restricted to united states government issues  high grade bank obligations  high grade corporate bonds and certain money market funds 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair market value of our total portfolio of approximately  and an increase of approximately  respectively  at december
