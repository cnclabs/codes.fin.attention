see also  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results numerous factors may cause our total revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting and may result in decreases in our available cash and declines in the market price of our stock 
competition the dso industry is highly competitive 
our primary competition comes from internal research and development departments of companies that develop device systems in house 
in many cases  companies that develop device systems in house have already made significant investments of time and effort in developing their own internal systems  making acceptance of our products as a replacement more difficult 
additionally  many of these in house departments may increasingly choose to use open source software  such as the linux operating system 
we also compete with independent software vendors  including enea ose systems ab  green hills software  inc  mentor graphics  microsoft corporation and qnx software systems  ltd  as well as a number of other vendors that address one or more segments of the device system design process 
we also compete with vendors of linux based products such as metrowerks a subsidiary of motorola  inc  and montavista software  inc 
some of the companies that develop device systems in house and some of these independent software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we do 

table of contents we believe that the primary competitive factors in the industry center around the way customers and potential customers manage their process of software development 
key factors driving their approach to software development include managing limited internal resources  controlling costs  minimizing development time and limiting their risks 
as a result  the major competitive factors in our industry are reliability  performance  price and customer support 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we face intense competition in the dso industry  which could decrease demand for our products or cause us to reduce our prices for a further description of factors that may impact our competitive position 
product development and engineering we believe that our success will continue to depend primarily on our ability to maintain and enhance our current product line  develop new products  maintain technological competitiveness and meet an ever expanding range of customer and market requirements 
as of january   our product development and engineering group included full time employees 
during fiscal  and  product development and engineering expenses were million  million and million  respectively  excluding capitalized software development costs 
during the fiscal years ended january  and  we incurred product and development and engineering expenses that qualified for capitalization of  and  respectively 
there were no costs incurred that qualified for capitalization during fiscal year see strategic alliances above for information on research and development funded by third parties 
proprietary rights our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology 
to protect our proprietary rights  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
as a part of our regular business processes  we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with employees  consultants  distributors  customers and corporate partners  as appropriate  and thereby limit access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
furthermore  our licensing agreements provide for protection of our intellectual property both in terms of source code handling and underlying intellectual property ownership of modifications to the wind river code 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results the rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and reduce our ability to compete 
wind river and the wind river logo are registered trademarks in the united states and other countries worldwide 
we have used  registered  and or applied to register specific trademarks and service marks to distinguish many of our products  technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and in foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
we have filed and obtained a number of patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad that relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
as of january   we held issued patents in the united states  none of which have expired 
the expiration dates of these patents range from to while we believe that patent protection of our products is important  any patents obtained may not provide substantial protection or be of commercial benefit to us 
it is also possible that their validity will be challenged 
manufacturing our manufacturing operation consists of assembling  packaging and shipping the software products and documentation needed to fulfill each order 
outside vendors provide tape and cd duplication  printing of 
table of contents documentation and manufacturing of packaging materials 
we also manufacture and assemble our hardware development tools at our factory in canton  massachusetts and at certain subcontractor facilities 
we do not believe that backlog is a meaningful indicator of sales that can be expected in future periods  particularly in view of the fast pace of technological change in the software industry 
employees as of january   we had  employees  including in sales and marketing  in professional services and support activities  in product development and engineering and in management  operations  finance and administration 
of these employees  were located in north america and were located outside of north america 
none of our employees in north america is represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage 
our employees are vital to our success  and our key management  engineering  sales and other employees are difficult to replace 
we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees or maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
if we are unable to attract  assimilate  retain or motivate highly qualified technical and sales employees in the future through competitive compensation and employment policies  our ability to develop and introduce competitive new products in a timely manner may suffer

our software is used to optimize the development and functionality of devices as diverse as digital imaging products  auto braking systems  internet routers  jet fighter control panels and factory automation machines 
our products and professional services are used in multiple markets including aerospace and defense  automotive  digital consumer  industrial  and network infrastructure and help customers to enhance product performance  standardize designs across projects  reduce research and development costs and shorten product development cycles 
how we earn our revenues our product revenues are derived from the licensing of our wind river platform products  our development tools and real time operating system software  as well as hardware products  which assist our customers with the overall development process of their devices 
our customers use these tools  middleware and our operating system software to develop applications  which are then used in completed devices such as those described above 
generally  we charge our customers a production license fee for every copy of our operating system software that is included in the final manufactured device 
customers can elect to either pre pay royalties or report their usage on a quarterly basis as they manufacture units 
our services revenues are derived from maintenance services  such as telephone support and provision of updates to our products on a when and if available basis  as well as professional services on both a time and materials and fixed price contract basis 
these professional services are designed to assist our customers with the design and development of a completed device or application 
we do not provide support or updates and enhancements to the customers end products 
our licensing models prior to november  we licensed the majority of our software on a perpetual basis 
under this model  our customers pay an initial license fee together with an annual maintenance fee  which was based on a fixed percentage of the total licensing fees 
the terms of the perpetual license for our software restricted the customer s use to a specific project  such as a line of printers or digital camera and  as a result  any software licenses or prepaid production license fees could generally only be used on that specific project 
under this perpetual licensing model  the majority of revenue is recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered  with a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of maintenance services being deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 

table of contents in november  we introduced our wind river platforms  which we license using an enterprise license model 
these platforms bundle a combination of development tools  an operating system and various protocols and interfaces into market specific platforms 
under the enterprise license model  we license these market specific platforms under an annual subscription based development license and aggregated production licenses  while eliminating our traditional project and site restrictions 
at the end of the subscription period  the customer s usage rights to the products expire unless renewed 
under the enterprise license model  we recognize the fees paid as revenue ratably over the subscription period 
in comparison to our more traditional licensing model  an order for an enterprise license will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a perpetual license 
we currently sell our products using both perpetual licensing and enterprise licensing models and anticipate that this will continue 
however  we expect the proportion of business that is sold under our enterprise license model will continue to increase 
the adoption of our enterprise model has been in line with our expectations and we believe that this model will allow us to increase the number of our customer s developers using our products and will provide an opportunity to increase other revenues such as professional services revenues 
since the introduction of our wind river platforms in november  we review the combination of revenue and increase in deferred revenue as a measure of the performance of the company 
our deferred revenue has increased from million at january  to million at january   primarily as a result of the adoption of this new business model 
recent changes to our business model in february  we announced a new option under our enterprise license model that eliminates the per unit production license fees 
under this option  the annual license fee will be higher  but a customer will not pay per unit production license fees for distribution of their products which incorporate our software 
production license fees have traditionally been a significant portion of our revenue  representing and of our total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
we anticipate that offering this option will allow our customers to have greater flexibility in meeting their business needs 
we cannot be certain that our customers will prefer and select this option or  if selected  what impact this option will have on our results of operations and financial statements 
see factors that may affect future results we have recently announced an option for our wind river platform customers that eliminates production license fees  which  if adopted by our customers  could adversely impacted our revenues 
recent operating results beginning in fiscal and continuing throughout fiscal  we were significantly impacted by the general economic downturn  which has been especially pronounced in the high technology sector generally and the networking infrastructure sector in particular 
our customers have cancelled projects or placed them on hold  which has had an impact on our revenues 
our customers have also seen a decline in the demand for their devices  which has impacted our production license revenues 
our total revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal  compared to fiscal our net loss was million  million and million  or a net loss of per share  per share and per share  in fiscal  and  respectively 
on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
and  accordingly  we did not amortize any goodwill in fiscal or if we had not amortized goodwill in fiscal  net loss would have been million  or net loss per share 
the decline in our revenues has led us to take a number of actions to reduce our costs in order to return to profitability 
accordingly  we have implemented a number of restructuring plans to match our costs with our revenues 
the overall effect of these restructuring plans has been to reduce our headcount from approximately  at the beginning of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal this headcount reduction has 
table of contents significantly lowered our overall cost structure 
we have also reduced our consulting costs  discretionary spending and other general operating costs and have closed or consolidated excess operating facilities 
see results of operations for the years ended january   and restructuring and other costs 
see also factors that may affect future results 
future considerations as discussed above  the strategy for our wind river platforms is to seek enterprise wide adoption 
under our traditional perpetual model we sold our products at the specific project level and were dealing primarily with the engineers leading and making decisions for individual projects 
as a result  the customer s decision to adopt our products is now more strategic leading to longer sales lead times and ultimately more complex and time consuming negotiations 
our success is therefore dependent upon our ability to first educate our current and potential customers of the value associated with our wind river platforms and secondly our ability to negotiate and close such transactions with these customers on terms which are mutually agreeable 
in addition  the success of the introduction of our wind river platforms that includes a per seat subscription model with no production licenses is dependent upon customer acceptance of this business model and the success that we have in ensuring that the upfront fees will be sufficient to offset the loss of subsequent production license fee revenues 
if the additional upfront fees are not sufficient  our revenues and earnings could decline 
as discussed above  we also have experienced a decline in revenues  net losses and operating cash flows in recent years 
to ensure our long term success we need to increase our revenues  return to profitability and generate positive cash flow from operations 
for further discussion of the risks associated with these items  see factors that may affect future results below 
key operating metrics members of our senior management regularly review key financial information including net revenues  operating income or loss  earnings or loss per share  changes in deferred revenue  cash flow from operations and free cash 
we define free cash as the sum of cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments and restricted investments less long term debt 
this information allows us to monitor the profitability of our business and evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made in the areas of customer support  product development  marketing and site operations 
we believe that an understanding of key financial information and how it changes over time is important to investors  analysts and other parties analyzing our business results and future market opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
note  summary of significant accounting policies of notes to the consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by us on a regular basis and which are also reviewed by senior management with the audit committee of our board of directors 
an accounting policy is deemed by us to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
the policies and estimates that we believe are 
table of contents most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity are revenue recognition  estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles  restructuring charges  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  service revenues and subscription revenues  net of sales returns and other allowances 
product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  and fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing and for sales of our hardware 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
subscription revenues consist of primarily revenues from the licensing under our enterprise licensing model  the wind river platforms  which include a combination of product and services  including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and support services such as installation and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
revenues for fiscal  when we introduced our wind river platforms  have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
for fiscal years prior to fiscal  subscription revenues have been reported as part of product revenues due to their immateriality 
agreements generally do not allow the right of return or sales price adjustments 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended sop  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for all undelivered elements of the arrangement and collection is determined to be probable 
these four criteria are further defined as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice to have non cancelable contracts and a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
product revenues for software and hardware are recognized at the time of shipment or upon the delivery of a product master  with standard transfer terms of fob shipping point 
if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement  delivery is not considered to have occurred 
if only non essential products or services are undelivered and if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the recognition of fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we recognize revenues from time based and subscription based licenses ratably over the term of the agreement 
our enterprise license model agreements require that we deliver unspecified future updates and upgrades within the same product family during the subscription term 
accordingly  fees from our enterprise license agreements are recognized ratably over their term 
sales to distributors  original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers are recognized either at the time the risks of ownership have transferred or upon receipt of production 
table of contents reports related to the sale of product to an end user  depending on our historical experience with these customers 
professional service revenues are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products 
revenue from these services is recognized separately from the license fee because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop generally  revenue from time and materials consulting contracts are recognized as services are performed 
contract accounting is utilized for service revenues from fixed price contracts and those requiring significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the arrangement fee is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input costs 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgments related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization  changes to specification and testing requirements and collectibility of unbilled receivables 
service revenues from software maintenance  support and update fees are recognized ratably over the contract period  typically months 
service revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are provided 
the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable 
at the time of each transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
for product and subscription revenues  if a significant portion of a fee is due after our standard payment terms  which are generally no greater than days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due 
collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
based on our review process  if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection of the resulting receivable is not probable  then revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
we must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable and  for fixed price contracts  make estimates of costs to complete 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances 
as a result  management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
in making such estimates  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue could result 
similarly  management makes estimates of the non collectibility of accounts receivables  specifically analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance 
table of contents for doubtful accounts 
in addition to the identification of individual specific doubtful accounts receivable  we provide allowances for other accounts receivable based on our historical experience 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported operating expenses could result 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill and purchased intangibles 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received 
these include acquired customer base  workforce  technological know how  trademarks and goodwill 
intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives ranging from one year to four years on a straight line basis 
intangible assets acquired subsequent to june  have been accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
business combinations sfas no 
and have been amortized in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
for all other intangible assets  wind river adopted the provisions of sfas on february   which requires that goodwill be no longer amortized  but continue to be evaluated for impairment 
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the second quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
we currently operate in one reportable segment  which is also the only reporting unit for the purposes of sfas no 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill for impairment purposes were the discounted cash flow and market methods 
we typically complete this assessment with the assistance of a third party consultant 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets when circumstances indicate an impairment has occurred and in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
accordingly  we evaluate asset recoverability when an event occurs that may impair recoverability of the asset 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying amount of each asset by reviewing the following factors the undiscounted value of expected operating cash flows in relation to its net capital investments  the estimated useful or contractual life of the asset  the contract or product supporting the asset 
in the case of purchased intangibles and capitalized software development costs  we periodically review the recoverability of the asset s value by evaluating its products with respect to technological advances  competitive products and the needs of its customers 
the impairment charge for goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets is assessed based upon estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill  purchased intangibles or long lived assets using an appropriate discount rate that incorporates our cost of capital and the risk profile of the associated investment 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are highly subjective and require significant management judgment as these estimates require us to make assumptions regarding future operating results  which are inherently difficult to predict  particularly in the current business environment 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
for details about the impairment charges we recorded during fiscal  and  see results of operations years ended january   and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles below 
restructuring charges in fiscal  and  restructuring and other charges consist of costs associated with restructuring programs implemented by wind river 
we account for the individual components of our restructuring activities as discussed further below

we adopted sfas no 
effective january   therefore  our restructuring activities were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our restructuring obligations recognized in connection with our restructuring activities initiated in fiscal and  as these obligations continue to be accounted for in accordance with eitf and eitf and other applicable pre existing guidance 
the following is a summary of the accounting principles used to record and measure our  and restructuring activities and associated obligations restructuring 
the expenses incurred in connection with our restructuring are comprised entirely of severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce  which have been accounted for primarily in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when management commits to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also requires that i liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities be measured at fair value  and ii one time termination benefits be expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee  unless the employee must provide future service  in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the future service period 
a small portion of our restructuring costs for fiscal have been accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for postemployment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  sfas no 

we have applied sfas no 
to a small number of international employees where we have historically provided substantially the same termination benefits based on local statutory regulations 
accordingly  we record the liability related to these termination costs when we determine that they are both probable and estimable  which is generally when i we approve a termination plan that commits us to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination  ii the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and their job classifications  and iii the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
and restructuring 
restructuring obligations incurred prior to the adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal and were accounted for and continue to be accounted for in accordance with eitf  sab and eitf the expenses incurred in connection with our and restructurings are comprised primarily of i severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of our workforce  ii consolidation of excess facilities  and iii impairment costs associated with certain other assets 
we accounted for the individual components of the and restructurings as follows severance and associated employee termination costs 
in accordance with eitf and sab  we recorded the liability related to these termination costs when the following conditions had been met i management with the appropriate level of authority approves a termination plan that commits us to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination  ii the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the termination benefits  iii the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and their job classifications  and iv the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
the termination costs recorded by us are not associated with  nor do they benefit  continuing activities 
consolidation of excess facilities 
we accounted for the costs associated with the consolidation of excess facilities in accordance with eitf and  accordingly  we recorded the costs associated with excess facilities when the related leased property had no substantive future use or benefit to us 
our estimated 
table of contents excess facility costs represent the remaining lease payments and estimated costs less estimated proceeds from subleasing certain facilities 
the estimated proceeds from subleasing these facilities are based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
impairment costs associated with certain other assets 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million related to certain other assets  primarily assets associated with certain products that management decided to discontinue as a result of our restructuring programs 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
in determining our restructuring charges  the majority of estimates made by management related to our charges for excess facilities 
in determining the charge for excess facilities  we were required to estimate future sublease income  negotiated lease settlement costs  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
these estimates  along with other estimates made by management in connection with our restructuring  may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control 
specifically  these estimates will depend on our success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to our reserve for the consolidation of excess facilities will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
we review the status of our restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to our restructuring obligations as part of operating expenses based on management s most current estimates 
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
judgment is applied to estimate taxable income by jurisdiction and our ability to utilize any unexpired credits and or net operating losses 
we are subject to income tax audits in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate and  as a result  must also assess exposures to any potential issues arising from current or future audits of current and prior years tax returns 
accordingly  we must assess such potential exposure and  where necessary  provide a reserve to cover any expected loss 
to the extent that we establish a reserve  our provision for income taxes would be increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax asset in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations for the years ended january   and revenues we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  service revenues and subscription revenues  net of sales returns and other allowances 
product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  and fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing and for sales of our hardware 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
subscription revenues consist of revenues from the licensing under our enterprise licensing model  of our wind river platforms  which include a combination of product and services  including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and 
table of contents support services such as installation and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
revenues for fiscal  when we introduced our wind river platforms  have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
for fiscal years prior to fiscal  subscription revenues have been reported as part of product revenues due to their immateriality 
we accrue for sales returns and allowances based on our historical experience 
years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages product revenues subscription revenues service revenues total revenues  net total revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to the general decline in our revenues over the last few years is primarily due to lower customer demand for hardware and software products  including revenues from production licenses  which are generally tied to the number of devices deployed by our customers 
this lower customer demand is mainly a result of the continuing economic downturn in the high technology sector  which started during fiscal and has continued through fiscal this downturn has affected us both directly  by decreasing our sales  and indirectly  because our products are incorporated into our customers products  and as our customers sales decline  our production license revenues have declined as well 
the general economic downturn has also impacted our service revenues as the lower demand for hardware and software has reduced our customers maintenance requirements and decreased the number of projects our customers are undertaking that use our professional services 
our product and service revenues have also been affected as the result of the transition of some of our customers to our wind river platforms 
fees from the wind river platforms are recorded as subscription revenue ratably over the license term  which is typically one year 
in contrast under our perpetual model  a significant percentage of the transaction fee is recognized in the quarter the transaction is completed 
while this has impacted  and will continue to impact  our revenues in the short term as customers transition to the wind river platforms  our deferred revenues have increased to million at january  from million at january   primarily as a result of the transition of business to our wind river platforms 
product revenues product revenues for our products sold under perpetual licenses are comprised of two components upfront software licensing revenue and production license revenue 
the table below sets forth information for such components 
years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages software licenses production license revenues total product revenues software licenses declined in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined in fiscal compared to fiscal production license revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal and 
table of contents declined in fiscal compared to fiscal software licenses have decreased as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the transition to our wind river platforms  which are accounted for as subscription revenues 
during the last three fiscal years  some of our customers  notably those in the networking and communications sectors  have i decreased research and development budgets  ii sought to increase the value they receive from vendors  including us  iii attempted to leverage a more competitive bidding process when spending research and development budgets  and or iv deferred or canceled projects  in whole or in part 
as a result of these factors  we believe that some of our customers have undertaken development in house  selected solutions they perceive to be less expensive or have relied on existing licenses rather than purchasing new products from us 
also the increase in the use of open source software  which is royalty free  has provided our customers with an additional option for selecting development tools  which may be more appealing than our existing royalty bearing products 
subscription revenues 
subscription revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal due to their immateriality  subscription revenues in fiscal were reported as part of product revenues 
fiscal was the first full fiscal year in which we sold our wind river platform products under the enterprise license model 
thus  the significant increase in subscription revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from the transition of a number of our customers from our traditional perpetual licensing model to our enterprise license model 
we expect that subscription revenues will increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the future 
in the short term  the transition of customers to enterprise license model will affect the level of our overall revenues because we recognize fees under the this business model ratably as opposed to our perpetual model where a significant proportion of the fee is recognized at the time the transaction is completed 
service revenues years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages maintenance revenues other service revenues total service revenues maintenance revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal  and declined in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect maintenance revenues will continue to decline as our customers transition to our wind river platforms  which includes maintenance as a part of the subscription fee 
other service revenues declined in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition to the impact from the general economic environment  other service revenues were also impacted in fiscal due to a disruption in services backlog arising from a reorganization of our sales force 
during fiscal year  we generated million in revenue from fixed price services contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 

table of contents revenues by geography years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages north america emea japan asia pacific total revenues  net revenues from international sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and by in fiscal from million in fiscal the overall decreases were due to a and decrease in revenues from europe  the middle east and africa  or emea  a and decrease in revenues from japan  and a and decrease in revenues from asia pacific  between fiscal and and fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in international revenues over these periods resulted primarily from the same macroeconomic factors that have impacted our business in north america and have caused our customers to reduce their research and development spending and purchase fewer of our products and services 
additionally  many of our customers are large multinational corporations that have reduced capital spending across all geographic regions 
our international revenues have also been affected as the result of the transition of some of our customers to our wind river platforms  in which revenue is recognized ratably as opposed to being recognized immediately under our perpetual license model 
international revenues accounted for  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues  although the actual percentage may fluctuate from period to period 
our international sales are generally denominated in local currencies 
the economic downturn experienced in the past three years  together with the continued uncertainties surrounding the timing and strength of an economic recovery  continues to make forecasting and financial and strategic planning difficult for us 
the adverse impact of the downturn on the capital markets and any uncertainty surrounding the timing and strength of any recovery could impair our ability to raise capital as needed and impede our ability to expand our business 
in addition  as discussed earlier  our continued success is dependant upon our ability to successfully transition customers to our wind river platforms and to generate sufficient revenues from our production license free business model to offset any resultant reduction in production license revenues 
for further discussion about factors affecting our revenues see factors that may affect future results below 
cost of revenues years ended january  percentage of associated revenues  net in thousands  except percentages product subscription service amortization of purchased intangibles total cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage 
table of contents the general decline in overall costs of products and services was due to lower fixed costs such as employee costs  consulting cost and manufacturing and distribution costs arising from our restructuring activities during fiscal  and and also due to a reduction in third party royalty costs as sales volume declined over the last few years 
also cost of product and cost of services have decreased in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the transition to our wind river platforms  which are accounted for as cost of subscription 
cost of product 
cost of products decreased by  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal and by  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal product related costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits for production employees  other direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software  and shipping costs 
the decline in product related costs in absolute dollars in fiscal  and was primarily due to lower direct production costs as well as lower third party royalty costs 
direct production costs were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized software development costs in fiscal  and amounted to   and million  respectively  and third party royalty costs for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the decline in product related costs as a percentage of product revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal and was related to the decline in direct production costs as a percentage of revenues resulting from our restructuring activities undertaken in fiscal and product related cost of revenues may be affected in the future by the amortization of capitalized software development costs  costs of distribution related to the introduction of new products and by royalty costs for use of third party software in our products 
cost of subscription 
subscription related costs of revenues consists primarily of subscription related costs  including salaries and benefits for production employees  other direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  royalty payments to third parties for the use of their software  shipping costs and costs of providing subscription related maintenance and support services 
the increase in absolute dollars in subscription costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to fiscal being the first full year in which we sold our wind river platforms under the enterprise license model 
prior to fiscal  subscription related costs of revenues were reported primarily as costs of product revenue and service revenue 
the increase in cost of subscription revenues as a percentage of subscription revenues in fiscal was due to the fact that our wind river platforms include a higher mixture of services costs which traditionally carry a proportionally lower gross margin 
subscription related production costs were million and  during fiscal and  respectively 
subscription related maintenance and support services costs were million and  during fiscal and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized software developments costs for fiscal and were  and  respectively  and third party royalty costs were  for fiscal we expect costs of subscriptions to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of subscription revenue based on the level of sales of our wind river platforms and the transition of existing customers from our perpetual based licensing to the enterprise license model 
cost of subscriptions may be affected in the future by the direct production costs  amortization of capitalized software development costs  costs of distribution  royalty costs for use of third party software in our products  and the costs of providing subscription related maintenance and support services 
cost of services 
cost of services decreased by  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal and by  or million  in fiscal compared to fiscal service related cost of revenues consist primarily of personnel related costs associated with providing services  including consulting services  to customers and the infrastructure to manage a services organization  as well as costs to recruit  develop and retain services professionals 
the decrease in absolute dollars of service costs in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal  was primarily due to reduced use of outside consultants and a reduction of full time employees as part of the restructuring programs implemented in fiscal and we realized overall cost reductions of million and million in professional service costs relating primarily to internal payroll and external contractor costs  million and million in training costs  and million and 
table of contents million in maintenance costs in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal  respectively 
in addition  cost of service revenues decreased as a percentage of services revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal and due in part to the transition to our wind river platforms which are accounted for as costs of subscriptions 
we expect cost of services to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of service revenue based on our ability to fully utilize our professional services organization 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles relates to amortization of completed technology acquired through purchase transactions 
the decrease in amortization in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a lower amortizable base of purchased intangible assets 
at january   the net book value of completed technology was million  which is expected to be fully amortized in fiscal during the year ended january   we reclassified from operating expenses to cost of revenue the amortization of purchased intangibles for the years ended january   and the reclassification did not change total net revenues  net loss or net loss per share 
operating expenses the general decline in selling and marketing  product development and engineering and general and administrative costs as shown below  was due in a large part to the restructuring programs we implemented during fiscal  and  which led to decreased overall costs  primarily payroll related expenses  consulting expenses  general operating expenses  such as travel costs and reduced depreciation expenses arising from reduced capital expenditures 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and other marketing related expenses  compensation related expenses  sales commissions and travel costs 
percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages selling and marketing as a percentage of total revenues the decrease in absolute dollars of selling and marketing expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal was attributable to lower sales commission expenses as a result of decreased sales volume in each consecutive fiscal year and from decreased expenditures as a result of the restructuring programs implemented during fiscal and sales commission costs decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal and by million in fiscal compared to fiscal salaries and related fringe costs decreased by million  travel expenses decreased by million  consulting expenses decreased by million and rent and utilities decreased by million  in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  depreciation expense decreased by million due to a lower depreciable base of our short lived fixed assets in fiscal compared to fiscal salaries and related fringe costs decreased by million  travel expenses decreased by million  trade show expenses decreased by million and rent and utilities decreased by million  in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  bad debt expense decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the higher level of bad debt expense in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in our exposure from customers who filed for bankruptcy during that year 
although selling and marketing expenses decreased in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal  these expenses as a percentage of revenue increased because expenses declined at a lower rate than revenues 
we believe selling and marketing expenses in absolute dollars will not increase significantly in the short term 
however  we do expect an increase in absolute dollars in the long term  as we continue to focus on long term growth in the areas of sales and marketing personnel and marketing and advertising programs 

table of contents product development and engineering expenses 
product development and engineering expenses consist primarily of payroll related expenses  facility costs and consulting fees for our product research and development organization 
percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages product development and engineering as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in absolute dollars of product development and engineering expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to cost control measures relating to our restructuring programs implemented in fiscal and salaries and fringe costs decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal and by million in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  depreciation expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a lower depreciable base of our short lived fixed assets 
although product development and engineering expenses decreased in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal  these expenses as a percentage of revenue increased because expenses declined at a lower rate than revenues 
we also received million in fiscal  and million in both fiscal and  respectively  of third party funded research and development which offset a portion of our gross research and development expenses 
we expect the dollars received for funded research and development accounted for as an offset to gross research and development expenses to be reduced significantly in the long term due to our winding down of these programs 
we believe that product development and engineering expenses in absolute dollars will not increase significantly in the short term 
however  we do expect an increase in absolute dollars  in the long term  as we continue to focus on long term growth in the areas of research and development 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation related expenses  facilities related expenses and external fees for professional services  such as legal and accounting 
percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in absolute dollars of general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to cost control measures relating to our restructuring programs implemented in fiscal  and due to these restructuring plans  we realized million in payroll related cost reductions in fiscal compared to fiscal and million in fiscal compared to fiscal our legal and accounting costs were million less in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of lower legal costs resulting from our restructuring plans  and from having incurred  of legal costs in fiscal relating to an employee litigation matter 
travel costs also decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in costs in fiscal was offset by million in stock compensation charges associated with the separation of our former chief executive officer  thomas st 
dennis 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will not increase significantly in the short term 
however  we do expect an increase in absolute dollars in the long term  as we invest in worldwide staff and infrastructure in the areas of information systems and finance and administration 
we allocate the total costs for information technology  facilities and fixed asset depreciation to each of the functional areas based on certain headcount data 
information technology allocated costs include salaries  information technology  project costs  communication costs and depreciation expense for fixed assets 
facilities allocated costs include facility rent for the corporate offices as well as shared function offices  property taxes  
table of contents depreciation expenses for office furniture and other department operating costs 
fixed asset depreciation allocated costs includes straight line depreciation expense on buildings  leasehold improvements  computer equipment  software  furniture and office equipment 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages amortization of goodwill and other intangibles as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in amortization in fiscal compared to was due to a lower amortizable base of other intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily related to the adoption of sfas no 
on february  sfas no 
required that effective for our fiscal  goodwill no longer be amortized  but continue to be evaluated for impairment 
during the year ended january   we recorded amortization of goodwill of million and amortized million of acquired workforce previously classified as purchased intangible assets  under the accounting rules applicable to that period 
at january   the net book value of other intangibles was  which is expected to be fully amortized in fiscal acquisition related reversals 
acquisition related reversals totaled   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the acquisition related reversals in fiscal related to the reversal of fees associated with the consolidation of duplicate international subsidiaries and the reversals in and related primarily to leasehold properties from our merger with integrated systems 
we were able to sublease some properties for longer than we had anticipated and were able to exit other leasehold properties earlier than originally estimated 
the reversal in fiscal was offset in part by  of in process research and development write off associated with an acquisition 
impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentages impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles as a percentage of net revenues during the second quarters of fiscal  and and during the fourth quarters of fiscal and  we identified possible impairments of goodwill and certain purchased technologies relating to previous acquisitions 
the impairments were based on a change in the long term strategic plan for these purchased technologies following a deterioration in the business climate and changes in sales and cash flow forecasts 
in anticipation of continued customer spending and as part of our strategic plans  we acquired businesses to complement and extend our product offerings 
since these acquisitions were made  many companies in the high technology and software industries had experienced significant decreases in capital funding and customer spending and  as a result  had curtailed research and development activities 
therefore  revenues associated with these businesses did not meet the original expectations at the time of acquisition 

table of contents accordingly  we compared the undiscounted cash flows associated with such acquired business and long lived assets with the respective carrying amounts and determined that an impairment of certain of these assets existed 
as a result  we recorded aggregate charges of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the entire charge for both fiscal and related to the impairment of purchased intangible assets  million of the charge for fiscal related to the impairment of purchased intangible assets and million of the charge for fiscal related to the impairment of goodwill 
the impaired amount was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the present value of the estimated future cash flows for the businesses acquired from which goodwill and purchased intangibles arose as follows impairment expense for years ended january  acquired entity in thousands eonic systems  nv telenetworks berkeley software design  inc embedded support tools corporation audesi technologies  inc rapid logic  inc icesoft as sofware development systems  inc the impairment review of these assets was determined based upon the estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill and purchased intangibles  using discount rates ranging from to for fiscal and to for fiscal no discount rate was applied in fiscal due to the short term nature of remaining cash flows 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  were determined using our best estimate as of the date of the impairment review 
the impairment charge for those assets held for disposal was determined based on the expected proceeds of disposition 
as of january  and  we had net book values of goodwill of million and million  respectively  and net book values of purchased intangibles of million and million  respectively 
all identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  will continue to be amortized in accordance with sfas no 
see note  impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other costs 
restructuring and other costs consist of costs associated with restructuring programs  a settlement with our former chief executive officer and with the settlement of litigation and related remediation efforts 
restructuring charges 
we recorded net restructuring charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  which in each case were classified as operating expenses 
in response to market conditions and the decline in our revenues  in fiscal  and  we implemented restructuring plans that were designed to align our anticipated revenues more closely with our cost structure 
our restructuring plans have been based on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature and severity of the current industry adjustment and general economic trends  and involved the implementation of a number of initiatives  including headcount reductions  facilities closures  and other cost control measures such as employing a program of office closure days and reducing discretionary spending on items such as consulting and travel 
as a result of the headcount reductions  we eliminated an aggregate of employee positions in fiscal  employee positions in fiscal and employee positions in fiscal  which collectively represented approximately one half of our employee base as of the beginning of fiscal our restructuring programs for fiscal and were initiated prior to our adoption 
table of contents of sfas no 
and have been accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sab  eitf and eitf our restructuring programs for fiscal have been accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
for a further discussion of factors that may affect the success of the restructuring program  see factors that may affect future results our restructuring plans may not enable us to achieve profitability in a difficult economic environment or achieve our business objectives 
as of january   our total restructuring liabilities related to our restructuring plans for fiscal and were approximately million and there were no remaining restructuring liabilities related to our restructuring plans for fiscal the following table summarizes our restructuring liabilities as of january   and work force reduction consolidation of excess facilities other total in thousands cash charges non cash charges reversals total charges cash payments non cash write offs restructuring liabilities as of january  cash charges non cash charges reversals total charges cash payments non cash write offs restructuring liabilities as of january  cash payments cash charges reversals restructuring liabilities as of january  the worldwide workforce reductions implemented during fiscal were fully completed in fiscal and the workforce reductions implemented during fiscal were substantially completed during the first half of fiscal the workforce reductions implemented in fiscal will be substantially completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal each workforce reduction affected all business functions  including sales and marketing  professional services  product development and engineering  and finance and administration and impacted employees from our operations in north america  emea and japan 
in addition  we reduced the number of contractors and temporary workers used by us as a result of the fiscal and restructuring programs 
we recorded net workforce reduction charges of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively  relating primarily to severance payments and the continuation of benefits 
equipment disposed of or removed from operations as a result of the workforce reduction resulted in non cash charges of  in fiscal and  in fiscal and consisted primarily of computer equipment 
we recorded a net restructuring charge of million and million during fiscal and  respectively  relating to the consolidation of certain excess facilities primarily in the united states  japan and europe 
the consolidation of excess facilities includes the closure of certain leased corporate facilities and sales offices that related to business activities that were restructured 
the estimated excess facility costs represent the 
table of contents remaining lease payments and estimated costs less estimated proceeds from sub leasing certain facilities 
the estimated proceeds from sub leasing these facilities are based on current comparable rates for leases in the respective markets 
if rental rates for our leased facilities continue to decrease in these markets or it takes longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
cash and non cash charges relate primarily to lease terminations  non cancelable lease costs and impairment of leasehold improvements related to the excess facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a reversal of million against the original million charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal after we determined that it would be more efficient and cost effective if certain of the excess facilities originally provided for continued to be used by wind river personnel 
the decision to maintain such facilities was based on changes in the local business environment and lack of competitive leasing rates for new sites 
as a result  we recorded a net charge for excess facilities of million for fiscal  which primarily related to excess facilities located in the united states 
as of january   there were no remaining liabilities relating to excess facilities provided for during the fiscal restructuring 
amounts accrued due to the consolidation of excess facilities as a result of the fiscal restructuring programs will be paid through fiscal  unless we successfully negotiate to exit the leases at an earlier date 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million for other items primarily relating to research and development activities that management decided to discontinue as a result of our restructuring activities 
other charges 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of  associated with a settlement with our former chief executive officer  thomas st 
dennis 
the charge primarily related to compensation for tax liabilities arising from the settlement of a shareholder loan that mr 
st 
dennis held with us

other income expense years ended january  percentage of total revenues  net in thousands  except percentages interest income interest expense other income expense  net total other income expense interest income 
interest income declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower invested balances  lower interest earned on our investments as a result of lower interest rates and higher amortization expense related to our fixed income securities 
total cash and cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments at the end of fiscal and were approximately million and million  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal and declined by in fiscal compared to fiscal we pay interest on our outstanding convertible subordinated notes semi annually and record the amortization of certain issuance costs associated with these notes as other expense 
additionally  since the first quarter of fiscal  we have incurred interest of approximately  each quarter on our loan facility with wells fargo  which was the primary cause of the increase in interest 
table of contents expense in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense declined in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the fact that during fiscal we repurchased and redeemed our convertible subordinated notes which carried a interest rate and replaced them with our current convertible subordinated notes which carry a interest rate 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion of our convertible subordinated notes and our loan facility 
other income expense  net

during fiscal  other expense reflected our write down of certain public and private investments of approximately million  costs associated with the termination of our interest rate swap liabilities  which totaled million  and a write down of a receivable and escrow account relating to the disposition of a previously acquired business  which totaled million 
during fiscal  the net expense was primarily due to the write down of certain private and publicly traded investments of million and a loss on the disposition of a previously acquired business of million  offset in part by a realized gain of million related to the disposition of the remaining shares of liberate technologies  inc as a result of the write downs during fiscal and  we have no remaining investment book value on our balance sheet relating to private companies as of january  or provision for income taxes despite incurring net losses in fiscal  and  we had a tax provision of million  million and million and an effective tax rate of  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
this represents our estimated liability for state and foreign income taxes as well as foreign withholding taxes incurred during the year 
in each fiscal year we recorded a valuation allowance based on management s determination that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets as of january   and will not be realized due to our ongoing operating losses and the challenging current economic environment 
as of january   deferred tax assets of approximately million consisting of certain net operating loss and credit carry forwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options had not been recognized in the financial statements 
when utilized  the tax benefit of these losses and credit carry forwards will be accounted for as a credit to additional paid in capital 
post close events after our announcement on february  of our preliminary financial results for the quarter and year ended january   we entered into a settlement agreement with our former chief executive officer  thomas st

during fiscal  we paid million relating to our restructuring activities  primarily severance costs 
the cash paid for restructuring activities was offset primarily by an increase in deferred revenue of million relating primarily to the customer adoption of our wind river platforms under the enterprise license model 
under this model  customers typically pay for the associated subscription fees upfront under our standard business terms although revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period  typically one year 
net cash used in operating activities for fiscal consisted of cash used by operations of million offset by an increase in cash of million arising from changes in assets and liabilities  primarily accounts receivable

our operating cash flows depend heavily on the level of our sales 
to a large extent our sales depend on general economic conditions affecting us and our customers  as well as the timing of new product introductions and other competitive factors and our ability to control expenses successfully 
in fiscal  our investing activities used net cash of million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal investing activities generally relate to the purchase of investments  business acquisitions and equipment purchases  partially offset by cash provided from the sale and maturity of investments 
acquisitions of property and equipment totaled million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively  of which million in fiscal represented the purchase price of our headquarters buildings

in june  the board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock over a two year period  primarily to manage future dilution from employee incentive plans including option and employee stock purchase plans  as well as potential dilution relating to our convertible bond 
during fiscal  the primary source of cash was million from the offering of our convertible notes  as discussed below  along with proceeds of million received from the issuance of common stock from employee stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
cash provided by these sources was partially offset by cash of million used to repurchase or redeem the outstanding convertible notes as discussed below 
convertible subordinated notes during fiscal  we repurchased and retired million in face value of our convertible subordinated notes 
in january  we redeemed the remaining million of the convertible subordinated notes at a redemption price of of the principal 
the net impact of gains and losses on the repurchase  retirement and redemption of the convertible subordinated notes was a gain of  net of taxes  which was reflected in other income expense  net for fiscal in december  we issued million of convertible subordinated notes due december the notes are unsecured  subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share

interest is payable in cash semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  commencing june  at the option of the holder  the notes may be converted into our common stock at any time at the then current conversion price 
we may redeem all or a portion of the notes for cash at a redemption price of of the principal amount between december  and december   and of the principal amount beginning december  and thereafter 
the indenture under which the notes were issued provides that an event of default will occur if i we fail to pay principal or premium on the notes  ii we fail to pay interest on the notes and fail to cure such non payment within days  iii we fail to perform any other covenant required of us in the indenture and the failure is not cured or waived within days  or iv we or one of our significant subsidiaries fails to pay  at final maturity or upon acceleration  any indebtedness for money borrowed in an outstanding principal amount in excess of million  including lease commitments  and the indebtedness is not discharged  or the default is not cured  waived or rescinded within days after written notice is provided in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
if any of these events of default occurs  either the trustee or the holders of at least of the outstanding notes may declare the principal amount of the notes to be due and payable 
in addition  an event of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization involving us or any of our significant subsidiaries will constitute an event of default under the indenture and  in that case  the principal amount of the notes will automatically become due and payable 
in the event of a change in control  the bondholders may require us to purchase our notes at of the principal amount  plus accrued interest  this purchase could be completed in cash  our common stock or common stock of the parent corporation of the acquiring corporation  if publicly traded  or a combination thereof 
commitments in september and november  we entered into two operating leases for our headquarters facility constructed on land owned by us in alameda  california 
after consideration of various financing alternatives for 
table of contents the construction of our headquarters buildings on land owned by us  the related economic impact of each alternative and the ability to retain control of the property  we chose a form of financing that we believed offered beneficial economic terms  commonly referred to as a synthetic lease 
these leases were treated as operating leases for accounting purposes and financing leases for tax purposes 
a synthetic lease is a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party funds of the costs for the acquisition and or construction of the property and leases the asset back to the company  as lessee 
none of our officers or employees had any financial interest in these synthetic lease arrangements 
in january  we notified the lessor of our intent to exercise the purchase options under the synthetic leases 
in april  we completed the transactions  terminated the synthetic leases and purchased the buildings for a purchase price of million 
as a result of our completion of the purchase options  we reflect the buildings as an asset on our balance sheet 
additionally  restricted investments of million held under the leases were released 
prior to the exercise of the purchase options  we reflected lease payments as a rental expense in our statement of operations 
having acquired the buildings  we no longer record a lease expense for the buildings and we record depreciation expense for the buildings over their estimated useful lives of years 
in connection with the termination of the synthetic leases  in april  we entered into a loan facility for an aggregate principal amount of million  consisting of a million non revolving loan commitment and million term loan  both of which mature in april during the quarter ended april   we borrowed million of the facility at an interest rate currently equal to 
under the terms of the facility  we are holding million in marketable securities as restricted investments to secure the performance of our obligations under the facility 
we may prepay the loan facility at any time 
see note  convertible subordinated notes and other borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the loan facility 
the facility agreement contains customary events of defaults  including payment defaults  breaches of representations and warranties  covenant defaults  certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency and change of control  material judgments  and a cross default to other material agreements and debt where we have incurred any liability in excess of million 
if an event of default occurs  and we do not or cannot cure the default within the time periods specified in the facility agreement  the lender would be entitled to terminate the facility and declare the outstanding amounts under the loan facility to be immediately due and payable

minimum future sublease income to be received under noncancelable subleases is approximately million 

table of contents we had no material planned capital commitments as of january  subsequent to january   however  we made a decision to implement the next version of our enterprise resource planning system and have committed expenditures of  for software licenses   for hardware costs and million in implementation costs associated with this project 
these costs are expected to be incurred primarily during the first half of fiscal our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including our research and development expenditures  expenses related to selling  general and administrative operations and working capital to support business growth 
we anticipate that our operating and capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on i the level of our future sales which depend  to a large extent  on general economic conditions affecting us and our customers  as well as the timing of new product introductions and other competitive factors and ii our ability to implement our restructuring plans and to control expenses 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will satisfy our cash requirements for working capital  product development and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited by the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding and or our recent performance and financial condition  particularly if our bond rating is lowered or withdrawn  as well as general market conditions if the continuing economic downturn were to continue or become more serious 
during fiscal our corporate credit rating was downgraded by standard poors from b to b 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that such financing will be available on favorable terms 
if we were unable to obtain financing  we might be required to reduce our expenses  including product development and engineering expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin are effective for us in the first interim period ending april  we are currently assessing the impact of adopting fin for pre existing entities created or acquired prior to february  but do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 which emends sfas no 
for certain decisions made by the fasb derivatives implementation group 
in particular  sfas no

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and amends certain other existing pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  in addition  most provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 

table of contents factors that may affect future results our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer  and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
in late fiscal  we introduced our wind river platforms  which are licensed under a new enterprise licensing model  that includes a new type of licensing arrangement  and cannot be sure that the new model will be successful 
in november  we introduced our wind river platforms  which are licensed under a new enterprise license model that includes subscription licenses rather than our traditional perpetual licenses 
we are still in the process of transitioning customers to our wind river platforms and it is possible that our enterprise license model will not be successful 
there is a risk that we will not be able to continue our rate of transitioning customers or that those customers who have not already transitioned may not accept the new products we offer under our enterprise license model or that they may reject the terms of the model itself 
there is a further risk that we may remain dependent upon large end of quarter transactions  that our selling efforts in coming quarters could be disrupted  and that the continued transition to the enterprise license model could cause us to incur unanticipated administrative and other costs 
in any such event  our revenue and earnings for a quarter could be below our expectations 
although enterprise licenses represent a potential source of renewable license revenue  there is also a risk that customers will not renew their licenses at the end of the term 
in addition  there is a risk that customers who purchase enterprise licenses may spend less in the aggregate over the term of the enterprise license than if they had been required to purchase perpetual licenses under our traditional perpetual licensing model 
also  because the wind river platforms include limited services  customers may purchase fewer stand alone services from us  which could negatively impact our services revenues 
the strategy for our wind river platforms is to seek enterprise wide adoption in contrast to our traditional perpetual model which were sold at the specific project level 
as a result  instead of dealing primarily with the engineer leading and making decisions for individual projects  we are now focused on more strategic decision makers  which leads to longer sales lead times and  ultimately  more complex and time consuming negotiations 
if we do not successfully educate our current and potential customers of the value associated with the wind river platforms or are unable to negotiate and close such transactions  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the transition to the new enterprise license model has impacted the timing of our reported revenues 
the transition to the new model has impacted the timing of our reported revenues 
under the enterprise license model revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
by contrast  our traditional perpetual license requires a majority of license revenue to be recognized in the quarter in which the products are delivered and a much smaller amount relating to the fair value of the maintenance being deferred and recognized subsequently over the maintenance period 
therefore  an order for a wind river platform will result in lower current quarter revenue than an equal sized order for a perpetual license 
as a result  our reported revenue has been affected by the adoption of the enterprise license model for our wind river platforms 
the impact on near term and deferred revenue will continue to depend on the rate at which customers transition from our perpetual model to our enterprise license model 
to the extent that the adoption rate is higher than we expect  we may experience a greater decline in near term revenue  as well as an increase in deferred revenue 

table of contents we have recently announced an option for our wind river platform customers that eliminates production license fees  which  if adopted by our customers  could adversely impact our revenues 
our wind river platforms  as well as our stand alone operating systems and middleware products are embedded in end user products developed and marketed by our customers  and we traditionally received production license fees for each copy of our software products embedded in the customers products 
in response to market demand  we recently introduced a production license free option in which qualifying customers may elect to pay a larger upfront fee in lieu of paying production license fees 
production license fees have traditionally been a significant portion of our revenue  representing and of our total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
we cannot be certain that the upfront fees will be sufficient to offset the loss of production license fee revenue 
if that were to occur  our revenues and earnings would likely decline 
additionally  customers may not accept this alternative and may choose to purchase products from our competitors or use royalty free software instead of purchasing our products under either a production license agreement or under the new option  either of which would have an adverse impact on our revenues and earnings 
because a significant portion of our revenue continues to be derived from production licenses  we are dependent upon the ability of our customers to develop and penetrate new markets successfully 
our production license revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully negotiate production license agreements with our customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
in particular  we derive significant revenue from customers that develop products in highly competitive and technologically complex markets such as the internet infrastructure  servers and storage  digital consumer  aerospace and defense  industrial control and automotive markets 
if these customers sell fewer products or otherwise face significant economic difficulties  our revenues will decline 
for example  our revenues from production licenses declined  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  which we believe is primarily due to our customers response to the current market conditions in the high technology sector 
we cannot control our customers product development or commercialization or predict their success 
in addition  we depend on our customers to accurately report the use of their products in order for us to collect our revenues from production licenses 
if our customers are not successful with their products or do not accurately report use of their products to us  our production license revenues may decline significantly 
we have recently adopted an open source strategy that may not be successful or may expose us to additional risks 
beginning in late fiscal  we adopted a strategy to address the open source market 
see part i  item  business products and services open source strategy for further information about this strategy 
we cannot be certain whether this strategy will be successful and it may create additional risks for us 
specifically  we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop the products necessary to satisfy customer demand  or that our customers will adopt our products based on open source 
additionally  even if our products are adopted by our customers  they may not be profitable  very few open source companies have been profitable and we may not be able to generate profits on our linux based offerings 
moreover  it is possible that these efforts to coexist with the open source movement could result in a decline in sales of our proprietary software either as a result of a diversion of internal resources or customer preference 
additionally  customers may defer orders in anticipation of our new products 
if any of these events were to occur  our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected 
additionally  linux has been developed and licensed under the gnu general public license and similar open source licenses 
these licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied  modified and distributed 
the gnu general public license is a subject of litigation in the case of the sco group  inc v 
international business machines corp  pending in the united states district court for the district of utah 
it is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in that litigation or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them 
any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable  or that linux based operating systems  or significant portions of them  may not be liberally copied  modified or distributed  would have the effect of preventing us from selling or 
table of contents developing our products 
we could be prevented from selling or developing our software if the gnu general public license and similar licenses under which our products are developed and licensed are not enforceable 
additionally  uncertainty concerning sco group s allegations  regardless of their merit  could adversely affect sales of our linux based products 
finally  as a result of concerns about the sco group lawsuit and open source generally  we may be forced by our customers to adopt additional indemnification or otherwise protect them from potential threats by sco group or other companies 
in any such event  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
the economic downturn over the last three fiscal years has adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  our earnings and revenues 
in addition  uncertainties associated with the downturn increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting 
the general economic downturn that commenced in in the united states and expanded to many other regions of the world during has adversely impacted our revenues and earnings 
this downturn has been especially pronounced in the high technology sector generally and the telecommunications sector in particular 
beginning in fiscal year and continuing through fiscal year  we have experienced a decline in revenues and a loss of profitability  which we believe is attributable  at least in part  to these downturns 
our total revenues decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal we cannot be sure that our financial condition and results of operations won t continue to be affected adversely by the continuing poor economic conditions 
the economic downturn experienced in the past three years  together with the uncertainties surrounding the timing and strength of any economic recovery  makes forecasting and financial and strategic planning more difficult than usual 
the adverse impact of the downturn on the capital markets and any uncertainty surrounding the timing and strength of any recovery could impair our ability to raise capital as needed and impede our ability to expand our business 
our restructuring plans may not enable us to achieve profitability in a difficult economic environment or achieve our business objectives 
in each of fiscal  and  we implemented restructuring plans that were designed to align our anticipated revenues more closely with our cost structure 
our restructuring plans were based on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature and severity of the current industry adjustment and general economic trends 
we cannot be certain that the assumptions underlying the restructuring plans will prove to be accurate 
if they are not  our restructuring plans may not result in the correct alignment of our anticipated revenues and cost structure 
our restructuring plans involved the implementation of a number of initiatives  including headcount reductions  facilities closures  and other cost control measures  that may adversely affect our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
as a result of the headcount reductions  we eliminated an aggregate of  employee positions in fiscal  and we also recorded net restructuring charges of million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
these measures may adversely affect our ability to realize our current or future business objectives 
in addition  the costs actually incurred in connection with restructuring actions may exceed our estimated costs of these actions 
additional restructuring actions may result in further cash and or non cash charges  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as a result  we cannot be sure that we will return to profitability as a result of our restructuring plans 
numerous factors may cause our total revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations increase the difficulty of financial planning and forecasting and may result in decreases in our available cash and declines in the market price of our stock 
a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  may cause or contribute to significant fluctuations in our total revenues and operating results 
these fluctuations make financial planning and 
table of contents forecasting more difficult 
in addition  these fluctuations may result in unanticipated decreases in our available cash  which could negatively impact our operations 
as discussed more fully below  these fluctuations also could increase the volatility of our stock price 
factors that may cause or contribute to fluctuations in our operating results and revenues include acceptance by our customers of our wind river platforms  the number and timing of orders we receive  including disproportionately higher receipt and shipment of orders in the last month of the quarter  changes in the length of our products sales cycles  which increase as our customers purchase decisions become more strategic and are made at higher management levels  reductions in the number of engineering projects started by our customers due to their own difficult financial or economic conditions  the impact of impairment charges arising from past acquisitions  the success of our customers products from which we derive our production license revenue  the mix of our revenues as between sales of products and lower margin sales of services  our ability to control our operating expenses  and fully realize the impact of the restructuring plans we have implemented  our ability to continue to develop  introduce and ship competitive new products and product enhancements quickly  possible deferrals of orders by customers in anticipation of new product introductions  announcements  product introductions and price reductions by our competitors  our ability to manage costs for fixed price consulting agreements  seasonal product purchases by our customers  which historically have been higher in our fourth fiscal quarter  the impact of  and our ability to react to  natural disasters and or events of terrorism  the impact of  and our ability to react to business disruptions arising from or relating to internet or computer viruses service interruptions  changes in business cycles that affect the markets in which we sell our products and services  economic  political and other conditions in the united states and internationally  foreign currency exchange rates  and the impact of any stock based compensation charges arising from the issuance of stock options  stock appreciation rights or any other stock based awards 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
results from prior periods are thus not necessarily indicative of the results of future periods 
we have substantial commitments  which could make it difficult for us to obtain financing and deplete our cash reserves 
additionally  these commitments could be accelerated in certain circumstances  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of january   we had million in outstanding indebtedness under our convertible subordinated notes and million in other long term debt 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  investments with maturities of greater than 
table of contents one year of million and restricted investments of million 
the indenture under which our convertible subordinates notes were issued contains customary events of default  and also provides that an event of default occurs if we or one of our significant subsidiaries fail to pay  at final maturity or upon acceleration  any indebtedness for money borrowed in an outstanding principal amount in excess of million  and the indebtedness is not discharged  or the default is not cured  waived or rescinded within days after written notice is provided in accordance with the terms of the indenture 
similarly  our loan facility agreement contains customary events of default  including a cross default to other material agreements and debt where we have incurred any liability in excess of million 
under the terms of our convertible subordinated notes and our loan facility  if an event of default were to occur for the aforementioned reasons or other reasons and we do not or cannot cure the event of default within specified periods  the lenders could in each case accelerate payment of the indebtedness 
we face intense competition in the device software industry  which could decrease demand for our products or cause us to reduce our prices 
the device software industry is characterized by rapid change  new and complex technology and intense competition 
our ability to maintain our current market share depends upon our ability to satisfy customer requirements  enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products 
due to the complexity of the markets in which we operate  where our customers often develop device systems in house  it is difficult to assess the impact of competition on our business and our related share of the markets that we operate in 
we have faced increasing competition in recent years as customers have decreased research and development budgets  sought to increase the value they receive from vendors  including us  attempted to leverage a more competitive bidding process when spending research and development budgets and or deferred or canceled projects  in whole or in part 
as a result  we believe that some customers have elected not to purchase our products and have chosen to undertake such development in house  selected solutions they perceive to be less expensive or relied upon existing licenses from us rather than making new purchases 
we expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
increased competitiveness may result in reductions in the prices of our products  run time royalties and services  lower than expected gross margins or loss of market share  any of which would harm our business 
our primary competition comes from internal research and development departments of companies that develop device systems in house 
in many cases  companies that develop device systems in house have already made significant investments of time and effort in developing their own internal systems  making acceptance of our products as a replacement more difficult 
additionally  many of these in house departments may increasingly choose to use open source software  such as the linux operating system 
we also compete with independent software vendors and  to a limited extent  with open source vendors 
some of the companies that develop device systems in house and some of these independent software vendors  such as microsoft corporation  may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  sales and other resources and significantly greater name recognition than we do 
demands for rapid change and the increasing complexity of the technology in our industry intensify the competition we face 
in addition  our competitors may consolidate or establish strategic alliances to expand product offerings and resources or address new market segments 
as a result  they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
these factors favor larger competitors that have the resources to develop new technologies or to respond more quickly with new product offerings or product enhancements 
we may be unable to meet the pace of rapid development set by our competitors or may incur additional costs attempting to do so  which may cause declines in our operating results 
our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our products obsolete  any of which could adversely affect our competitive position 

table of contents if our strategic relationships are not successful  our product offerings  distribution and or revenues may be adversely impacted 
we have many strategic relationships with semiconductor companies and customers 
these strategic relationships are complex because some of the companies that are our strategic partners in certain business areas are also our competitors in other business areas 
our strategic partners may also have concurrent relationships with companies that provide open source and in house solutions  which may put pressure on our product development roadmaps  timelines and prices 
if we are not successful in developing and maintaining these strategic relationships  our business may be harmed 
if our collaborative marketing and distribution agreements terminate or expire  the scope of our product offerings may be restricted  and the distribution of our products and revenues may be adversely impacted 
in addition  a key component of our open source strategy is our partnership with red hat 
if this partnership is not successful it may adversely affect our open source strategy  which in turn could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not continue to address new and rapidly changing markets and increasingly complex technologies successfully and deliver our products on a timely basis  our revenues and operating results will decline 
the dso market is characterized by ongoing technological developments  evolving industry standards and rapid changes in customer requirements and product offerings in the device market 
our success depends upon our ability to adapt and respond to these changes in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we fail to continually update our existing products to keep them current with customer needs or to develop new or enhanced products to take advantage of new technologies  emerging standards and expanding customer requirements  our existing products could become obsolete and our financial performance would suffer 
we have from time to time experienced delays in the commercial release of new technologies  new products and enhancements of existing products 
these delays are commonplace in the software industry due to the complexity and unpredictability of the development work required 
we must effectively market and sell new product offerings to key customers  because once a customer has designed a product with a particular operating system  that customer typically is reluctant to change its supplier due to the significant related costs 
if we cannot adapt or respond in a cost effective and timely manner to new technologies and new customer requirements  sales of our products could decline 
the costs of software development can be high  and we may not realize revenues from our development efforts for a substantial period of time 
introducing new products that rapidly address changing market demands requires a continued high level of investment in research and development 
our product development and engineering expenses were million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal year ended january  compared to million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal year ended january  if we are required to undertake extensive capital outlays to address changes in the device market  we may be unable to realize revenue as soon as we may expect 
the costs associated with software development are increasing  including the costs of acquiring or licensing new technologies 
our investment in new and existing market opportunities prior to our ability to generate revenue from these new opportunities may adversely affect our operating results 
our significant international business activities subject us to increased costs and economic risks 
we develop and sell a substantial percentage of our products internationally 
for fiscal  revenues from international sales were million  or of total revenue  as compared to million  or  of total revenue for fiscal additionally  we have investments in  or have made acquisitions of  companies located outside the united states 
over the long term  we expect to continue to make investments to further support and

risks inherent in international operations include the imposition of governmental controls and regulatory requirements  the costs and risks of localizing products for foreign countries  differences in business cultures and sales cycles  differences in operation and sales support expenses  unexpected changes in tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  restrictions on repatriation of earnings  exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiaries and branch operations  the costs and risks of operating in countries experiencing geopolitical conflict and or terrorism  the effect of our adoption of global pricing models  difficulties in integrating products and operations from foreign acquisitions  the impact of local health and political crises that prohibit or severely limit travel or other interaction with a local economic market  exposure to local economic slowdowns  and the need to guarantee credit instruments extended to support foreign operations 
any of these events  regionally and as a whole  could reduce our international sales and increase our costs of doing business internationally and have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and net operating results 
our common stock price is subject to volatility 
in recent years  the stock markets in general and the shares of technology companies in particular have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
these recent price fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the companies affected 
our stock price has similarly experienced significant volatility 
as reported on the nasdaq national market  during fiscal our stock had a high sales price of and a low sales price of and  during fiscal  our stock had a high sales price of and a low sales price of 
in past fiscal quarters  we have experienced shortfalls in revenue and earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and investors  which have had an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 
these factors relating to the fluctuations in our revenues and operating results may continue to affect our stock price 
comments by or changes in estimates from securities analysts as well as significant developments involving our competitors or our industry could also affect our stock price 
in addition  the market price of our common stock is affected by the stock performance of other technology companies generally  as well as companies in our industry and our customers in particular 
other broad market and industry factors may negatively affect our operating results or cause our stock price to decline  as may general political or economic conditions in the united states and globally  such as recessions  or interest rate or currency fluctuations 
in particular  the stock market may be adversely impacted  or experience unusual volatility  as a result of the outbreak of armed conflict or hostilities involving the united states or incidences of terrorism in  or directed at  the united states or its allies 

table of contents the rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate  which could enable third parties to use our technology and reduce our ability to compete 
our success depends significantly upon the proprietary technology contained in our products 
we currently rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our technology and products 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will adequately protect our rights  that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology  or that we can maintain our technology as trade secrets 
in addition  discovery and investigation of unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult 
we expect software piracy  which is difficult to detect  to be a persistent problem  particularly in those foreign countries where the laws may not protect our intellectual property as fully as in the united states 
employees  consultants  and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property 
we might not have adequate remedies for infringement or breach of our proprietary rights by third parties  employees or consultants 
further  we have in the past initiated  and in the future may initiate  claims or litigation against third parties for infringement or breach of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
whether or not such litigation is determined in our favor  such actions could result in significant expense to us  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel from productive tasks or cause product shipment delays 
patent  trademark or copyright infringement or product liability claims against us may result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to expend significant resources 
in addition  patent or copyright claims may require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
we occasionally receive communications from third parties alleging patent  trademark or copyright infringement or other intellectual property claims  and there is always the chance that third parties may assert infringement claims against us or against our customers under circumstances that might require us to provide indemnification 
additionally  because our products are increasingly used in applications  such as network infrastructure  transportation  medical and mission critical business systems  in which the failure of the device system could cause property damage  personal injury or economic loss  we may face product liability claims 
although our agreements with our customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to infringement and liability claims  these provisions may not be effective in doing so in all circumstances or in all jurisdictions 
any of these types of claims  with or without merit  could result in claims for indemnification by us or costly litigation  could require us to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or remedy product defects  cause product shipment delays or require us to pay significant damages if the claims are successful 
in the case of infringement of another party s intellectual property  we may be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  however  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses will be available or that they can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not successful in defending these claims or  with respect to infringement claims  were to fail to obtain royalty or licensing agreements in a timely manner and on reasonable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
legislative actions may cause our operating expenses to increase 
the sarbanes oxley act of  the california disclosure act and newly proposed or enacted rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission or the national association of securities dealers impose new duties on us and our executives  directors  attorneys and independent accountants 
in order to comply with the sarbanes oxley act and such new rules and regulations  we may be required to hire additional personnel and use additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services 
any of these developments could materially increase our operating expenses and accordingly reduce our net income or increase our net losses

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio and debt obligations

as stated in our policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss

we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity

we also believe an immediate basis point move in interest rates would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of our fixed income securities 
foreign currency risk we may enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exposures related to certain foreign currency denominated inter company balances 
additionally  we may adjust our foreign currency hedging position by taking out additional contracts or by terminating or offsetting existing forward contracts 
these adjustments may result from changes in the underlying foreign currency exposures or from fundamental shifts in the economics of particular exchange rates 
gains and losses on terminated forward contracts  or on contracts that are offset  are recognized in income in the period of contract termination or offset 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
as of january   we had outstanding contracts with the following terms buy sell sell sell sell currency gbp euro jpy amount rate usd equivalent maturity date contract amounts are representative of the expected amounts to be paid under the terms of these instruments
